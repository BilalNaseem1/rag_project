      "\n",
      "The video discusses the technical analysis of Bitcoin's price movement, focusing on the interaction with key moving averages like the 8-week and 20-week EMAs. The speaker suggests that Bitcoin may chop around the 8-week EMA for a while, potentially causing altcoin pairs to drop, before potentially falling below the 20-week EMA in June. This could coincide with a potential spike in the unemployment rate, which the speaker believes could prompt the Fed to start cutting interest rates, potentially leading to a rotation back into altcoins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker notes that historically, when Bitcoin has dumped and then rallied, the first time altcoin pairs get a boost, but the second time they don't see as big of a jump. This is because the altcoin market is struggling to catch a bid compared to Bitcoin. The speaker believes this pattern could continue, with Bitcoin chopping around the 8-week EMA while altcoin pairs on their Bitcoin pairs continue to drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also discusses the possibility of a scenario where Bitcoin falls below the 20-week EMA in June, coinciding with a potential spike in the unemployment rate. This could prompt the Fed to start cutting interest rates, which the speaker believes could lead to a rotation back into altcoins. However, the speaker acknowledges that the odds of a rate cut in June are currently low, but notes that this could change quickly if the unemployment data weakens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the speaker analyzes Bitcoin's price action on the daily timeframe, suggesting that it may be forming a parallel channel similar to what was seen in 2019 before the Fed's rate cuts. The speaker believes that if Bitcoin rallies into the Fed's May meeting and then gets rejected, it could lead to the final capitulation of altcoin pairs in May or June, potentially followed by the Fed cutting rates in June.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall sentiment is cautiously bearish in the short-term, with the speaker acknowledging the possibility of a left-translated market cycle peak, but still favoring a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio over the long run. The speaker also suggests that the breakdown in the Ethereum-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair may be an indicator of the consumer starting to falter, which could further weigh on the altcoin market.\n"

      "hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the equity verse today we're going to talk about the S&P 500 and we're just going to be providing a General Market Outlook if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptoverse decom I wanted to just provide some thoughts about the S&P 500 it has been a little while and of course we are coming into that time of the year of pre-election years where the market does tend to cool off just a little bit uh we talked about this in the last video and now you can see that it is starting to transpire a little bit if you're unfamiliar with what I'm talking about if you look at say the year-to-date Roi of the S&P 500 in election years right if you look at the election year average you'll often see that by about day 145 to 150 the market sets a low okay now currently we are on day what 114 about 114 or so um and so we're not quite there yet but we have already seen about a 6% drop so this is very similar seasonality that we even talked about late last year if you guys remember back during the summer of the pre-election year I suggested that we could get a 5 to 10% correction in the S&P 500 thanks to General seasonality right and if you go back and you look at what happened in 2023 you can see that we did get that you know that that correction and if you overlay it with pre-election years on average right you can see that the market does tend to cool off in about Q3 of the pre-election year so we did get that 5 to 10% correction back then now while we did talk about that I said pretty quickly after Yellen issued shorter duration than the market was expecting and they essentially kicked the can down the road uh by a lot of measures that was basically bullish uh for the stock market because it was bearish for for bonds right I mean I I I think if she had issued longer duration that that correction could have theoretically continued but when she issued short iteration it was not the best outlook for for the bond market and so the bond market then fell right if you go look if you overlay the tenure onto the chart you can see that the 10year topped out right there and then the 10e came down all right so the 10year yield came down so what you'll notice is that this correction over here corresponded to the 10e breaking to the upside we're also we just saw a 6% correction right here and you'll notice that it's corresponding to the 10-year yield moving back up to the upside so as the long into the old curve goes up it puts pressure on risk assets now so far all we've really seen is a fairly modest correction right now you may notice back over here in July the very first pullback was about a 6% pullback to that bull market support band very similar pullback right here right about a 6% pullback to the 20we SMA following that though the S&P then rallied back up about 5% now from where we found this local low the S&P is already up about 2.2% so it already has rally up off that low sum a 5% rally would actually take it all the way back up to around 5200 but what you'll notice is that it essentially sort of zigzagged its way down for about three months right I mean this this really started in July and it ended in late October Right started I guess mid July so you had August September and then it bottomed out in in late October it was about a 3mon correction or so that ultimately saw the S&P drop about 11% so it actually dropped a little bit more than I think what I suggested I said about a 5 to 10% drop back then it actually dropped about 11% um and so then of course you know Yellen issuing short iteration we saw the S&P climb on all the way back up and now it is once again SED to finded a little bit of weakness but remember there's often times some seasonal weakness around that April sort of that March April ail May time frame in the S&P 500 um again here is showing this year with the average of Prior election years and on average you know we sort of set a low sometime way out over here and if you compare this year to other years might not be that interesting to compare it to 2020 because that was the the pandemic year but if you look at other years like 2016 you can see that it followed a similar script right kind of moving up and then sort of settling back down into May and June uh 2012 is almost a carbon copy of what we're seeing right now where it sort of moves up gets a pullback and then get sort of a bounce into the last couple of weeks of April it then it then went on to roll over sort of into that May and June time frame the 2012 script here actually looks very similar to what we saw in Q3 of last year right you said a low a lower low and then one final low right now look at the year-to date Roi the S&P 500 in 2012 in that in this sort of this phase of the election year you said hello and then you get that bounce in in the late April and then you have a low a lower low and then one final lower low before then picking back up for the rest of the year and so that is something that I I think we should be aware of is is this sort of repeating this same pattern where you kind of come down you get a bounce back up you know that could go as high as maybe 5200 and then you go below the bullmark sport band and then ultimately try to find whatever your low is going to be so if if it were to reach the same extent of this correction it would actually put it all the way down at around you know 4700 something like that again there's no guarantee that it goes that low but I did want to at least highlight a couple of things one of which is this trend line that you could sort of draw out and say that you know the S&P has been holding as support with the exception of this fake out right here below the trend line which also corresponded to sort of capitulating pretty far below the bull market support band um now what's really interesting about this is you can overlay uh you can overlay sort of hyg minus the vix onto this chart and one of the things you'll notice here actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to do it the other way around I'm going to I'm going to pull up that metric right so we're going to pull up hyg minus the vix and you'll see on the hyg minus the vix you can see sort of a series of higher lows that are forming right you see those higher lows that have been forming now overlay the S&P 500 onto that chart right so we're going to um let me switch this over so let me actually s switch this to a log um now I want this one to be a log this one can just be a regular scale and what I'm going to do is is we're going to um sort of look at at this trend okay so we're going to say all right well if you connect with the Dots here right this low corresponded to that low on the S&P 500 right and then this low corresponded to the next low on the S&P 500 remember the S&P was also on sort of a similar trend line where this was a fake out below the trend line but that fake out also tagged this part where hyg minus the vix tagged that trend line you can see that hyg minus the vix just tagged that trend line again but while it did it it has tagged that trend line the S&P has still not gone back to that trend line and for the S&P to go back to that trend line it would correspond you know to a 4700 4800 S&P um for it to go back to that trend line so again I mean this is just basic General seasonality it has nothing to do with underlying macroeconomic conditions or anything like that it doesn't mean that it doesn't evolve into something else but historically we do see some type of Correction in the S&P 500 around this time right I mean you can see it in 2012 um here's 2008 well 2008 again was a recession here uh you can look at at 2004 and you'll see like how how the how the S&P kind of drops gets a little bit of a a late April rally and then sort of drops into may may uh May June time frame so I would keep an eye on that especially with the hyg minus the vix sort of back down to its trend line for the fourth time at some point these trend lines can break and if you're not familiar with this metric right if we sort of Zoom this thing out you can see what this looks like kind of going back further and actually there's kind of a nice sort of trend line here at the top that it it does tend to follow which is kind of interesting um to take a look at but every so often you will find it um sort of these you you'll see it kind of moving up and then it'll it'll get a big drop down to the bottom of this range okay so that is something I I I think think that is is worthwhile to watch out for and when it does drop to the bottom of these ranges it tends to correspond to pretty eventful moves in the S&P 500 right so if you were to look at at sort of this low when it dropped to the bottom of the range back in October 2022 it corresponded to that low if you were to look at it over here there was a big drop below it that was obviously the pandemic you can also see a big drop here by hyg minus the vix where it bottomed out December 2018 very similar thing over here in February 2018 after a pretty big drop same thing in August 2015 after a pretty big drop and and so on and so forth right 2011 um you know 2010 so when this thing you know as that thing rolls over and hits the bottom of this range here that often does Mark Bottoms in the S&P 500 um so again there's no guarantee that we're heading that way now uh perhaps we just hold the trend line again right it's possible that we just simply hold the trend line one once again and we and we just continue to climb the wall of worry as we go into into the summer months and honestly there's always a good chance that could happen um it's really difficult predicting when the market could deviate from General seasonality the the two main things that I could foresee causing deviations well there's three things right there's one there's geopolitical events which I mean you know no one's going to be timing that um so I don't even try you know I don't even really try to time that stuff because it just seems imposs possible uh number two inflation reaccelerating which I could see becoming an issue but I don't really think it's going to become an issue this year um I know a lot of people are calling for it to really re accelerate and go back up much higher in a second wave I think it's possible we get a second wave but if we do I would guess it wouldn't happen until maybe next year um you know after a a Fed pivot right I I think you know as long as you're on this side of the FED pivot I would still think that it it's just a matter of time before inflation just continues to slowly go down I could be wrong about that if the neutral rate is above the current fed funds rate I don't think the neutral rate is above the current fed funds rate I think the FED funds rate is above the neutral rate and we're just sort of watching the whole process play out um so I don't really think that inflation will re accelerate uh you know back up to seven or 8% this year it could be become a risk in future years if the FED pivots too soon before they get inflation say durably back back down to 2% so the only other thing that really leaves is the labor market um so as long as the labor market remains strong and by by that I mean you know as long as it's really printing below 4% unemployment rate then the market loves to keep on climbing the wall of worry um if you see a print above that then perhaps you get you sort of revisit the bottom of this range on on the hyg minus the vix but again we're not there at the current time I would keep an eye on this trend line though and see if the S&P sort of revisits that same trend line what's interesting is you know we talk a lot about about we mostly talk about crypto on this channel um but it is interesting how a lot of these things are are are very much correlated to one another right if you look at the S&P 500 you will find a trend line where it has tagged it you know a number of times right three times on the third attempt we had a fake out below it now if you were to look at say eth right uh ethusd you will find a very similar trend line right you'll find a very similar trend line where it's been putting in higher lows and on the third tag of the trend line it was a fake out below it so some of the times I I I think a lot of people sort of get caught up in the narratives of the different outside classes but in reality they're they're actually pretty much doing the same thing right it's just that crypto is a more volatile version of the S&P 500 right so like if if if the S&P is going up then often times you will see not always but often times you will see crypto outperform but if the S&P is going down often times you'll see the S&P um or you'll see crypto underperform what's really fascinating right now though is the fact that the S&P has already bounced off of its bullmark sport band right it went to its bullmark sport band the last time it was at its bullmark sport band was in late October you know a after the long of the yeld curve went all the way up to around 5% or so the NASDAQ already went below its 20we moving average and it's actually still below it today even though the Market's up 1 and a half% but despite that Bitcoin is still fairly well above its bullmark scorpion despite the fact that both the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ have already paid it a visit and so that's kind of interesting so if you do see um you know if you do see the S&P sort of fall back in to its 20we estimate in May kind of after potentially setting a lower high late April early May if it falls back into it once again kind of like it did right over here right it got a bounce off of it and then fell back down to it if you see something like that play out then it could correspond to sort of Bitcoin uh finally going back and testing its 20we SMA um but again there's no guarantee that it even sets a lower low in May or June I'm just sort of showing that General seasonality outside of macroeconomic stuff and outside of geopolitical stuff General season ality by the S&P 500 does show that look there is often times some weakness sort of going into that may time frame and and sometimes it even goes out until until June so I would keep that kind of on the back of you know sort of keep that on the radar a little bit uh the idea of of something like that potentially happening as we get out into May so if the S&P sort of resolves into a lower high in late April early May and starts to roll over again then you're going to be faced with this trend line once again which again could correspond to around that 4700 to 4,800 level I mean it's not even that much lower than the current prices right um it would only be about 6% lower which is basically the same amount that this first drop was right over here we dropped 6% we got a rally and then we dropped another 6% and then we got a rally and then we dropped another 6% right so we basically have three 6% drops basically back to back to back one month after another um so I think the ultimate question will be though and then we'll have to sort of revisit this assuming that it plays out we'll have to revisit it in May or June is that if we do come back to the trend line does it hold as support or not right does it actually hold as support and again remember the market needs a reason to go down not up so often times like just like it was back over here we got a big bounce off of it that doesn't mean you will always get a big bounce off of it I mean after you tag the trend line enough times right event eventually it will break um it's just a matter of you know how many times does it take to to ultimately break it and by the time you do break it you might not go back to you know where it previously was um but I would watch that level out into May and June and see if that trend line gets tested and if it does get tested whether we hold it or not will probably depend on on how the labor market is doing by then um I know last year we saw a big drump in the labor market data kind of going in the summer I think the June print saw the unemployment rate it was the unemployment rate for May but it Dro it jumped from 37 or it dropped from uh 34 to like 37 or something like that in a single month um and so that would be you know if that were to come into play then then maybe it it it falls below it but I would I would keep an eye on that trend line if we if we fade back into it in in sort of that may time frame if you look at a date range on you know sort of from here to here that was about 22 weeks and then from there to here it was about 31 weeks and then since leaving this area it's already been about 25 weeks right so 31 weeks would actually put you the first week of June you know for potentially retesting um that trend line if it were to take the same amount of time as it took over here and if it took say only you know 28 weeks then it would put it in about miday which would be somewhere between sort of this this to here and then this first one to the second test so I would continue to watch the S&P 500 overlay hyg minus the vix also I think to give some type of insight into what's going on there remember every time that it is tagged that trend line on that metric so too has the S&P 500 tagged this trend line as well um it just you know sometimes it it it bounces around for a a couple of months before actually finding that trend line so I would keep an eye on that um as we get out into the sort of the May and June time frame what I find kind of interesting is that you know some of these individual stocks are are behaving very different than what they normally do for instance Apple in 2024 is actually basically you know it's basically just gone down this year you know it's it's it's actually almost about 15% down uh for the year which if you compare that to 2020 I mean by this point in 2020 Apple was actually doing better which is kind of crazy to think about um 2016 it was around this level but not for another you know several days you not out for another several days or so and if you were to look at say 2012 you can see just how well Alpo was doing back then uh 2008 obviously was a recession year 2004 2000 was another recession year and then 1996 right so I I just kind of find it interesting because some of the names are are are doing okay but then some of these like juggernauts like apple are really struggling right but if you were to go look at say meta if you look at meta I imagine it doesn't look nearly as bad right meta's been doing better this year um you can see it's actually up quite a bit you know meta's up what like 36% year to date compare that to 2016 and 2020 it's above those two years but Apple I mean apple is certainly struggling and then you could look at other stocks uh like Nvidia which has been sort of the uh the one that's been leading this whole charge for the last year and a half or so it's up about 60% um which is well above where it was in 2020 and in 2016 uh you can go look at 2012 as well and 2008 and 2004 and 2000 and basically the year that Nvidia is tracking the closest right now I guess is the year 2ou uh 2000 where basically this is where it was at this point in the year but back then Nvidia wasn't you know the Behemoth that it is today right it was a much smaller company back then in fact Cisco was sort of what you might want to compare it to but again even those were very different companies and I don't really think it's the it's not like it's the the best comparison it is a comparison but it's not necessarily like the fairest or the best comparison person but I mean you can see just how some of the individual names are are struggling like apple whereas other ones are are actually doing quite well and so that on average the S&P um does tend to outperform a lot of people that sort of stock pick because it's it can be very difficult picking sort of the few that are are outperforming if you guys remember uh about a year ago we had the Magnificent 7 right but a lot of those names have really fallen off um recently right you've seen apple fall off uh you've seen uh I mean Tesla fell off a while back um I mean it's been struggling a lot recently it's currently up to I guess post Market it's up to 153 uh so it's back up a little bit here but you can see that Tesla year to date is actually down quite a bit so some of those names um have sort of fallen off from the Magnificent 7 while seems like fewer and fewer names are actually leading the charge you know like it used to be all seven of them but then as as time has gone on some of those names have have started to really underperform um some of the other ones right so I mean meta is still doing pretty well Nvidia is still relatively elevated Google I think Google was I mean Google's yeah that one's still doing it's been doing pretty well as well was obviously tracking it at one point uh Google's still doing uh pretty okay too but you can see like apple is has really fallen off here uh and and Tesla has really fallen off here and then I guess Microsoft was maybe the other one we could we could sort of just check in on here it's it actually got a pretty big drop last week but it's right back down to that bull market support ban which is ultimately where it found support in late 2023 so I would see you know if that just is going to hold support here over the next month or two as we get out into that general seasonality of um you know of May where the market does kind of go into a lull and then it sort of builds out from there assuming there's no macroeconomic forces at play that would cause it to take a detour from General seasonality but anyways I I I guess that'll wrap it up I just wanted to provide a very brief update on the S&P 500 and of course as always I mean there's no there's no guarantee that you even go down to that trend line right now perhaps we just hold the bullmark sport band and and continue to climb back up I mean there are examples of that right like right here in October 2021 sometimes you just sort of get a pullback to the 20we Ese and then you just continue to climb on up you've seen that a number of times um where you sort of tag the 20we moving average and and then just kind of continue to climb and maybe you keep retesting it but the general direction remains up so I would also keep that in mind as a as a potential outcome too I think the biggest insight as to whether this correction is going to occur could be based on what is the long end of the yeld curve continuing to do right you know is the long end going up and if it is you know how high is it going to go up or if it's going down why is it going down right is it going down for the right reasons or is it going down for the wrong reason Seasons uh so it obviously depends on quite a lot of stuff any we'll go and wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe and I'll see you guys next time

      "Hi, today we're going to talk about the S&P 500 and we're just going to be providing a General Market Outlook if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptoverse decom I wanted to just provide some thoughts about the S&P 500 it has been a little while and of course we are coming into that time of the year of pre-election years where the market does tend to cool off just a little bit uh we talked about this in the last video and now you can see that it is starting to transpire a little bit if you're unfamiliar with what I'm talking about if you look at say the year-to-date Roi of the S&P 500 in election years right if you look at the election year average you'll often see that by about day 145 to 150 the market sets a low okay now currently we are on day what 114 about 114 or so um and so we're not quite there yet but we have already seen about a 6% drop so this is very similar seasonality that we even talked about late last year if you guys remember back during the summer of the pre-election year I suggested that we could get a 5 to 10% correction in the S&P 500 thanks to General seasonality right and if you go back and you look at what happened in 2023 you can see that we did get that you know that that correction and if you overlay it with pre-election years on average right you can see that the market does tend to cool off in about Q3 of the pre-election year so we did get that 5 to 10% correction back then now while we did talk about that I said pretty quickly after Yellen issued shorter duration than the market was expecting and they essentially kicked the can down the road uh by a lot of measures that was basically bullish uh for the stock market because it was bearish for for bonds right I mean I I I think if she had issued longer duration that that correction could have theoretically continued but when she issued short iteration it was not the best outlook for for the bond market and so the bond market then fell right if you go look if you overlay the tenure onto the chart you can see that the 10year topped out right there and then the 10e came down all right so the 10year yield came down so what you'll notice is that this correction over here corresponded to the 10e breaking to the upside we're also we just saw a 6% correction right here and you'll notice that it's corresponding to the 10-year yield moving back up to the upside so as the long into the old curve goes up it puts pressure on risk assets now so far all we've really seen is a fairly modest correction right now you may notice back over here in July the very first pullback was about a 6% pullback to that bull market support band very similar pullback right here right about a 6% pullback to the 20we SMA following that though the S&P then rallied back up about 5% now from where we found this local low the S&P is already up about 2.2% so it already has rally up off that low sum a 5% rally would actually take it all the way back up to around 5200 but what you'll notice is that it essentially sort of zigzagged its way down for about three months right I mean this this really started in July and it ended in late October Right started I guess mid July so you had August September and then it bottomed out in in late October it was about a 3mon correction or so that ultimately saw the S&P drop about 11% so it actually dropped a little bit more than I think what I suggested I said about a 5 to 10% drop back then it actually dropped about 11% um and so then of course you know Yellen issuing short iteration we saw the S&P climb on all the way back up and now it is once again SED to finded a little bit of weakness but remember there's often times some seasonal weakness around that April sort of that March April ail May time frame in the S&P 500 um again here is showing this year with the average of Prior election years and on average you know we sort of set a low sometime way out over here and if you compare this year to other years might not be that interesting to compare it to 2020 because that was the the pandemic year but if you look at other years like 2016 you can see that it followed a similar script right kind of moving up and then sort of settling back down into May and June uh 2012 is almost a carbon copy of what we're seeing right now where it sort of moves up gets a pullback and then get sort of a bounce into the last couple of weeks of April it then it then went on to roll over sort of into that May and June time frame the 2012 script here actually looks very similar to what we saw in Q3 of last year right you said a low a lower low and then one final low right now look at the year-to date Roi the S&P 500 in 2012 in that in this sort of this phase of the election year you said hello and then you get that bounce in in the late April and then you have a low a lower low and then one final lower low before then picking back up for the rest of the year and so that is something that I I think we should be aware of is is this sort of repeating this same pattern where you kind of come down you get a bounce back up you know that could go as high as maybe 5200 and then you go below the bullmark sport band and then ultimately try to find whatever your low is going to be so if if it were to reach the same extent of this correction it would actually put it all the way down at around you know 4700 something like that again there's no guarantee that it goes that low but I did want to at least highlight a couple of things one of which is this trend line that you could sort of draw out and say that you know the S&P has been holding as support with the exception of this fake out right here below the trend line which also corresponded to sort of capitulating pretty far below the bull market support band um now what's really interesting about this is you can overlay uh you can overlay sort of hyg minus the vix onto this chart and one of the things you'll notice here actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to do it the other way around I'm going to I'm going to pull up that metric right so we're going to pull up hyg minus the vix and you'll see on the hyg minus the vix you can see sort of a series of higher lows that are forming right you see those higher lows that have been forming now overlay the S&P 500 onto that chart right so we're going to um let me switch this over so let me actually s switch this to a log um now I want this one to be a log this one can just be a regular scale and what I'm going to do is is we're going to um sort of look at at this trend okay so we're going to say all right well if you connect with the Dots here right this low corresponded to that low on the S&P 500 right and then this low corresponded to the next low on the S&P 500 remember the S&P was also on sort of a similar trend line where this was a fake out below the trend line but that fake out also tagged this part where hyg minus the vix tagged that trend line you can see that hyg minus the vix just tagged that trend line again but while it did it it has tagged that trend line the S&P has still not gone back to that trend line and for the S&P to go back to that trend line it would correspond you know to a 4700 4800 S&P um for it to go back to that trend line so again I mean this is just basic General seasonality it has nothing to do with underlying macroeconomic conditions or anything like that it doesn't mean that it doesn't evolve into something else but historically we do see some type of Correction in the S&P 500 around this time right I mean you can see it in 2012 um here's 2008 well 2008 again was a recession here uh you can look at at 2004 and you'll see like how how the how the S&P kind of drops gets a little bit of a a late April rally and then sort of drops into may may uh May June time frame so I would keep an eye on that especially with the hyg minus the vix sort of back down to its trend line for the fourth time at some point these trend lines can break and if you're not familiar with this metric right if we sort of Zoom this thing out you can see what this looks like kind of going back further and actually there's kind of a nice sort of trend line here at the top that it it does tend to follow which is kind of interesting um to take a look at but every so often you will find it um sort of these you you'll see it kind of moving up and then it'll it'll get a big drop down to the bottom of this range okay so that is something I I I think think that is is worthwhile to watch out for and when it does drop to the bottom of these ranges it tends to correspond to pretty eventful moves in the S&P 500 right so if you were to look at at sort of this low when it dropped to the bottom of the range back in October 2022 it corresponded to that low if you were to look at it over here there was a big drop below it that was obviously the pandemic you can also see a big drop here by hyg minus the vix where it bottomed out December 2018 very similar thing over here in February 2018 after a pretty big drop same thing in August 2015 after a pretty big drop and and so on and so forth right 2011 um you know 2010 so when this thing you know as that thing rolls over and hits the bottom of this range here that often does Mark Bottoms in the S&P 500 um so again there's no guarantee that we're heading that way now uh perhaps we just hold the trend line again right it's possible that we just simply hold the trend line one once again and we and we just continue to climb the wall of worry as we go into into the summer months and honestly there's always a good chance that could happen um it's really difficult predicting when the market could deviate from General seasonality the the two main things that I could foresee causing deviations well there's three things right there's one there's geopolitical events which I mean you know no one's going to be timing that um so I don't even try you know I don't even really try to time that stuff because it just seems imposs possible uh number two inflation reaccelerating which I could see becoming an issue but I don't really think it's going to become an issue this year um I know a lot of people are calling for it to really re accelerate and go back up much higher in a second wave I think it's possible we get a second wave but if we do I would guess it wouldn't happen until maybe next year um you know after a a Fed pivot right I I think you know as long as you're on this side of the FED pivot I would still think that it it's just a matter of time before inflation just continues to slowly go down I could be wrong about that if the neutral rate is above the current fed funds rate I don't think the neutral rate is above the current fed funds rate I think the FED funds rate is above the neutral rate and we're just sort of watching the whole process play out um so I don't really think that inflation will re accelerate uh you know back up to seven or 8% this year it could be become a risk in future years if the FED pivots too soon before they get inflation say durably back back down to 2% so the only other thing that really leaves is the labor market um so as long as the labor market remains strong and by by that I mean you know as long as it's really printing below 4% unemployment rate then the market loves to keep on climbing the wall of worry um if you see a print above that then perhaps you get you sort of revisit the bottom of this range on on the hyg minus the vix but again we're not there at the current time I would keep an eye on this trend line though and see if the S&P sort of revisits that same trend line what's interesting is you know we talk a lot about about we mostly talk about crypto on this channel um but it is interesting how a lot of these things are are are very much correlated to one another right if you look at the S&P 500 you will find a trend line where it has tagged it you know a number of times right three times on the third attempt we had a fake out below it now if you were to look at say eth right uh ethusd you will find a very similar trend line right you'll find a very similar trend line where it's been putting in higher lows and on the third tag of the trend line it was a fake out below it so some of the times I I I think a lot of people sort of get caught up in the narratives of the different outside classes but in reality they're they're actually pretty much doing the same thing right it's just that crypto is a more volatile version of the S&P 500 right so like if if if the S&P is going up then often times you will see not always but often times you will see crypto outperform but if the S&P is going down often times you'll see the S&P um or you'll see crypto underperform what's really fascinating right now though is the fact that the S&P has already bounced off of its bullmark sport band right it went to its bullmark sport band the last time it was at its bullmark sport band was in late October you know a after the long of the yeld curve went all the way up to around 5% or so the NASDAQ already went below its 20we moving average and it's actually still below it today even though the Market's up 1 and a half% but despite that Bitcoin is still fairly well above its bullmark scorpion despite the fact that both the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ have already paid it a visit and so that's kind of interesting so if you do see um you know if you do see the S&P sort of fall back in to its 20we estimate in May kind of after potentially setting a lower high late April early May if it falls back into it once again kind of like it did right over here right it got a bounce off of it and then fell back down to it if you see something like that play out then it could correspond to sort of Bitcoin uh finally going back and testing its 20we SMA um but again there's no guarantee that it even sets a lower low in May or June I'm just sort of showing that General seasonality outside of macroeconomic stuff and outside of geopolitical stuff General season ality by the S&P 500 does show that look there is often times some weakness sort of going into that may time frame and and sometimes it even goes out until until June so I would keep that kind of on the back of you know sort of keep that on the radar a little bit uh the idea of of something like that potentially happening as we get out into May so if the S&P sort of resolves into a lower high in late April early May and starts to roll over again then you're going to be faced with this trend line once again which again could correspond to around that 4700 to 4,800 level I mean it's not even that much lower than the current prices right um it would only be about 6% lower which is basically the same amount that this first drop was right over here we dropped 6% we got a rally and then we dropped another 6% and then we got a rally and then we dropped another 6% right so we basically have three 6% drops basically back to back to back one month after another um so I think the ultimate question will be though and then we'll have to sort of revisit this assuming that it plays out we'll have to revisit it in May or June is that if we do come back to the trend line does it hold as support or not right does it actually hold as support and again remember the market needs a reason to go down not up so often times like just like it was back over here we got a big bounce off of it that doesn't mean you will always get a big bounce off of it I mean after you tag the trend line enough times right event eventually it will break um it's just a matter of you know how many times does it take to to ultimately break it and by the time you do break it you might not go back to you know where it previously was um but I would watch that level out into May and June and see if that trend line gets tested and if it does get tested whether we hold it or not will probably depend on on how the labor market is doing by then um I know last year we saw a big drump in the labor market data kind of going in the summer I think the June print saw the unemployment rate it was the unemployment rate for May but it Dro it jumped from 37 or it dropped from uh 34 to like 37 or something like that in a single month um and so that would be you know if that were to come into play then then maybe it it it falls below it but I would I would keep an eye on that trend line if we if we fade back into it in in sort of that may time frame if you look at a date range on you know sort of from here to here that was about 22 weeks and then from there to here it was about 31 weeks and then since leaving this area it's already been about 25 weeks right so 31 weeks would actually put you the first week of June you know for potentially retesting um that trend line if it were to take the same amount of time as it took over here and if it took say only you know 28 weeks then it would put it in about miday which would be somewhere between sort of this this to here and then this first one to the second test so I would continue to watch the S&P 500 overlay hyg minus the vix also I think to give some type of insight into what's going on there remember every time that it is tagged that trend line on that metric so too has the S&P 500 tagged this trend line as well um it just you know sometimes it it it bounces around for a a couple of months before actually finding that trend line so I would keep an eye on that um as we get out into the sort of the May and June time frame what I find kind of interesting is that you know some of these individual stocks are are behaving very different than what they normally do for instance Apple in 2024 is actually basically you know it's basically just gone down this year you know it's it's it's actually almost about 15% down uh for the year which if you compare that to 2020 I mean by this point in 2020 Apple was actually doing better which is kind of crazy to think about um 2016 it was around this level but not for another you know several days you not out for another several days or so and if you were to look at say 2012 you can see just how well Alpo was doing back then uh 2008 obviously was a recession year 2004 2000 was another recession year and then 1996 right so I I just kind of find it interesting because some of the names are are are doing okay but then some of these like juggernauts like apple are really struggling right but if you were to go look at say meta if you look at meta I imagine it doesn't look nearly as bad right meta's been doing better this year um you can see it's actually up quite a bit you know meta's up what like 36% year to date compare that to 2016 and 2020 it's above those two years but Apple I mean apple is certainly struggling and then you could look at other stocks uh like Nvidia which has been sort of the uh the one that's been leading this whole charge for the last year and a half or so it's up about 60% um which is well above where it was in 2020 and in 2016 uh you can go look at 2012 as well and 2008 and 2004 and 2000 and basically the year that Nvidia is tracking the closest right now I guess is the year 2ou uh 2000 where basically this is where it was at this point in the year but back then Nvidia wasn't you know the Behemoth that it is today right it was a much smaller company back then in fact Cisco was sort of what you might want to compare it to but again even those were very different companies and I don't really think it's the it's not like it's the the best comparison it is a comparison but it's not necessarily like the fairest or the best comparison person but I mean you can see just how some of the individual names are are struggling like apple whereas other ones are are actually doing quite well and so that on average the S&P um does tend to outperform a lot of people that sort of stock pick because it's it can be very difficult picking sort of the few that are are outperforming if you guys remember uh about a year ago we had the Magnificent 7 right but a lot of those names have really fallen off um recently right you've seen apple fall off uh you've seen uh I mean Tesla fell off a while back um I mean it's been struggling a lot recently it's currently up to I guess post Market it's up to 153 uh so it's back up a little bit here but you can see that Tesla year to date is actually down quite a bit so some of those names um have sort of fallen off from the Magnificent 7 while seems like fewer and fewer names are actually leading the charge you know like it used to be all seven of them but then as as time has gone on some of those names have have started to really underperform um some of the other ones right so I mean meta is still doing pretty well Nvidia is still relatively elevated Google I think Google was I mean Google's yeah that one's still doing it's been doing pretty well as well was obviously tracking it at one point uh Google's still doing uh pretty okay too but you can see like apple is has really fallen off here uh and and Tesla has really fallen off here and then I guess Microsoft was maybe the other one we could we could sort of just check in on here it's it actually got a pretty big drop last week but it's right back down to that bull market support ban which is ultimately where it found support in late 2023 so I would see you know if that just is going to hold support here over the next month or two as we get out into that general seasonality of um you know of May where the market does kind of go into a lull and then it sort of builds out from there assuming there's no macroeconomic forces at play that would cause it to take a detour from General seasonality but anyways I I I guess that'll wrap it up I just wanted to provide a very brief update on the S&P 500 and of course as always I mean there's no there's no guarantee that you even go down to that trend line right now perhaps we just hold the bullmark sport band and and continue to climb back up I mean there are examples of that right like right here in October 2021 sometimes you just sort of get a pullback to the 20we Ese and then you just continue to climb on up you've seen that a number of times um where you sort of tag the 20we moving average and and then just kind of continue to climb and maybe you keep retesting it but the general direction remains up so I would also keep that in mind as a as a potential outcome too I think the biggest insight as to whether this correction is going to occur could be based on what is the long end of the yeld curve continuing to do right you know is the long end going up and if it is you know how high is it going to go up or if it's going down why is it going down right is it going down for the right reasons or is it going down for the wrong reason Seasons uh so it obviously depends on quite a lot of stuff any we'll go and wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe and I'll see you guys next time bye\n"

      "The video provides a detailed technical analysis of the S&P 500 and its historical performance during pre-election years, highlighting the tendency for the market to experience a 5-10% correction around the Q3 timeframe. The presenter notes that the current year is following a similar pattern, with the S&P 500 already experiencing a 6% drop. The analysis also examines the relationship between the S&P 500 and the 10-year yield, suggesting that as the long-end of the yield curve rises, it puts pressure on risk assets. The presenter suggests that the S&P 500 could potentially retest a key trend line, which could correspond to a drop to around the 4,700-4,800 level. However, the presenter also acknowledges that the market may simply hold the trend line and continue to climb, depending on factors such as geopolitical events, inflation, and the labor market. The overall sentiment of the transcript is cautiously bearish, with the presenter highlighting the potential for further downside in the S&P 500, while also acknowledging the possibility of a continued market rally.\n"

       "  'metadata': {'text': 'The video provides a detailed technical analysis of the S&P 500 and its historical performance during pre-election years, highlighting the tendency for the market to experience a 5-10% correction around the Q3 timeframe. The presenter notes that the current year is following a similar pattern, with the S&P 500 already experiencing a 6% drop. The analysis also examines the relationship between the S&P 500 and the 10-year yield, suggesting that as the long-end of the yield curve rises, it puts pressure on risk assets. The presenter suggests that the S&P 500 could potentially retest a key trend line, which could correspond to a drop to around the 4,700-4,800 level. However, the presenter also acknowledges that the market may simply hold the trend line and continue to climb, depending on factors such as geopolitical events, inflation, and the labor market. The overall sentiment of the transcript is cautiously bearish, with the presenter highlighting the potential for further downside in the S&P 500, while also acknowledging the possibility of a continued market rally.',\n",

       "  'metadata': {'text': \"The video discusses the technical analysis of Bitcoin's price movement, focusing on the interaction with key moving averages like the 8-week and 20-week EMAs. The speaker suggests that Bitcoin may chop around the 8-week EMA for a while, potentially causing altcoin pairs to drop, before potentially falling below the 20-week EMA in June. This could coincide with a potential spike in the unemployment rate, which the speaker believes could prompt the Fed to start cutting interest rates, potentially leading to a rotation back into altcoins.The speaker notes that historically, when Bitcoin has dumped and then rallied, the first time altcoin pairs get a boost, but the second time they don't see as big of a jump. This is because the altcoin market is struggling to catch a bid compared to Bitcoin. The speaker believes this pattern could continue, with Bitcoin chopping around the 8-week EMA while altcoin pairs on their Bitcoin pairs continue to drop.The speaker also discusses the possibility of a scenario where Bitcoin falls below the 20-week EMA in June, coinciding with a potential spike in the unemployment rate. This could prompt the Fed to start cutting interest rates, which the speaker believes could lead to a rotation back into altcoins. However, the speaker acknowledges that the odds of a rate cut in June are currently low, but notes that this could change quickly if the unemployment data weakens.Additionally, the speaker analyzes Bitcoin's price action on the daily timeframe, suggesting that it may be forming a parallel channel similar to what was seen in 2019 before the Fed's rate cuts. The speaker believes that if Bitcoin rallies into the Fed's May meeting and then gets rejected, it could lead to the final capitulation of altcoin pairs in May or June, potentially followed by the Fed cutting rates in June.The overall sentiment is cautiously bearish in the short-term, with the speaker acknowledging the possibility of a left-translated market cycle peak, but still favoring a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio over the long run. The speaker also suggests that the breakdown in the Ethereum-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair may be an indicator of the consumer starting to falter, which could further weigh on the altcoin market.\",\n",

       "  'metadata': {'text': \"Bitcoin dominance has put in a new cycle high of 57%, contrary to expectations that it had already topped. The speaker argues this is due to the timing of the dominance top being more closely tied to monetary policy than the typical 4-year market cycle. As the Federal Reserve continues quantitative tightening and delays rate cuts, the speaker expects Bitcoin dominance to continue rising, potentially reaching 60%. The speaker acknowledges the process is not linear, with potential pullbacks, but believes the general resolution will be to the upside.The speaker analyzes Bitcoin dominance excluding stablecoins, noting a similar pattern of lower highs followed by a sweep of the previous high, just as occurred in the previous cycle. This suggests Bitcoin dominance could see one more pullback before resuming its ascent towards 60%. The speaker believes this is due to the close relationship between Bitcoin dominance and monetary policy, as opposed to the typical 4-year market cycle.Regarding Ethereum against Bitcoin, the speaker suggests it could bottom around June if there is no bounce, aligning with historical seasonal weakness for Ethereum in the summer months. However, the speaker cautions against relying too heavily on trend lines, as altcoins can sometimes break below them before finding a bottom. The speaker expects altcoin pairs against Bitcoin to continue bleeding, with the potential for a 42% drop to the range lows around 0.25 BTC, as they have historically oscillated between 0.25 and 1 BTC.The speaker further elaborates on the relationship between Bitcoin dominance and monetary policy, noting that Bitcoin dominance tends to rise even after assets like gold break out, as seen in the previous cycle. The speaker suggests Bitcoin dominance could top out in the summer months, as that is typically when retail investors are less active in the market, allowing altcoins to bleed back to Bitcoin.The speaker also discusses the potential for a scenario where altcoin pairs against Bitcoin and altcoin pairs against the US dollar could bottom at the same time, if a larger capitulation in the traditional markets leads to a significant Bitcoin drawdown. However, the speaker's base case remains that altcoin pairs against Bitcoin will bottom first, before altcoin pairs against the US dollar continue to bleed for a period.Overall, the sentiment remains bullish on Bitcoin dominance and bearish on altcoins, particularly Ethereum, based on the speaker's analysis of monetary policy and market cycles.\",\n",

      "Summary: The discussion covers several key topics related to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and the broader cryptocurrency market. The speakers provide technical analysis and share their views on the potential impact of the halving, as well as the influence of macroeconomic factors and the Federal Reserve's policies.The speakers acknowledge the historical pattern of Bitcoin price rallying in the year following a halving event, but also caution that the current market conditions and macroeconomic environment could introduce some uncertainty and volatility. They discuss the concept of sell in May and go away, analyzing past market cycles and the potential for a similar pattern this year, while also noting that the halving year may disrupt this traditional seasonal trend.The discussion also touches on the importance of Bitcoin dominance as a key indicator for the overall crypto market, with the speakers suggesting that Bitcoin dominance may peak before Bitcoin itself falls below its 20-week moving average. This leads to a broader conversation about the risks and opportunities in the altcoin and meme coin markets, with the speakers emphasizing the importance of having a diversified strategy and regularly converting gains back into Bitcoin as a more stable and long-term investment.Additionally, the speakers explore the recent strength in the gold market, discussing the potential reasons behind the rally and the relationship between gold, the US dollar, and Bitcoin. They note the similarities between gold and Bitcoin as stores of value and the potential for gold to continue its upward trend as the US dollar weakens.The speakers also provide insights on the importance of understanding basic technical analysis and on-chain indicators to help identify the right times to enter the market, emphasizing the need to focus on higher timeframes and avoid getting caught up in the volatility of the hourly charts. They highlight the value of educational resources, such as their own YouTube channels, in helping newcomers to the crypto space navigate the market and avoid common pitfalls like scams and mistakes in managing their funds.Finally, one of the speakers, Max, shares his motivation for starting a YouTube channel, highlighting the desire to contribute to the crypto community in a positive and educational way, drawing inspiration from the approach taken by the other speakers.Overall, the discussion provides a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the current state of the cryptocurrency market, the potential impact of the Bitcoin halving, and the broader macroeconomic factors that may influence the market's performance in the coming months.\n",

      "Hi, this is NFA live this should be a relatively exciting show for two reasons first of all we have the Bitcoin having coming up in just about a day and we also have a new guest with us today Max from because Bitcoin uh how you doing great thanks so much for having me Ben yeah and you started you started doing this a year or two ago is that right yeah probably about 18 months ago officially yep all right yeah so max is um I've known him basically since probably before he even started the YouTube channel or right around the time that he started it uh so make sure you guys go subscribe to him and Rob as well uh links to that are in the description below so make sure you guys check that out and we're just going to go through a lot of the different questions that I think would probably be on people's minds as we go into the having uh so let's just go ahead and jump in Rob we'll start with you on this one the having is tomorrow it's tomorrow we've been waiting forever here it is fourth having um and I'm guessing it's going to garnish some attention should be making some headlines different places I'm curious what what effects do you think the having will have on the larger crypto space um do you think it'll bring new eyes to the scene or are we still kind of just uh you know the same old same old people just kind of hanging out um do you think it'll it'll actually bring new new people to the space uh we saw a lot of new people come to the space last cycle sometime after the having um or do you think it'll be quiet for a while and do you see any narrative shifts after the Havoc that's a pretty loaded question first of all I would just like to say that Max has a great background I'm sure he got to the same place I did which is fivr and uh hopefully he didn't get ripped off but it looks great and uh I gotta tell you one of these days max we're gonna have to put that into an nft just me and you so yeah yes that is my old green screen but I'll be jumping in that green screen as soon as the uh as the Bitcoin hits 100K But to answer Ben's question which I think is is what uh everybody wants to really try to figure out is this Bitcoin having and I know like there's a lot of first of all that I still believe in the fouryear cycle some people say that it doesn't really register I still and some people will talk like Bob Lucas will say well it's just left translated and we're going to see a big blowoff top in 2024 which could very well happen but I still think that the narrative around it and there's still a lot of people say well there's Mass adoption coming and it's already here I still think it's I mean I don't think that we're at the same level like we should be and what we could be in like 2028 or 2032 or you know time comes up but Ben if you get to show my my screen real quick because everyone wants to know like well the Bitcoin having and you did a great I I watched your your video Ben about uh uh the ethereum evaluation ethereum ethereum valuation of Bitcoin about how you know Bitcoin dominance is going up and how it's wreaking havoc and it's true it is right now I know people will will also talk about you know like hey well you know these things happen leading up to the having but if we take a look back this is from Smart Valor it's a good website and if we take a look they did all the work for him which is great this is how Bitcoin behav in the year leading up to each having because we had one of course in 2012 2016 then 2020 and I know people will say well there's always a dip there's always this massive dip before the having and there could be I mean we saw one pretty massive one in 2020 but of course there's a reason for that and and we could either say like it's because of the of the almighty Corona virus or it was something else but yeah there was a dip in 2016 but again just take a look at this so with having with the having one in 2012 the year leading up to the having it went up to 385 per. and the year after of course because we always see alltime highs the year after so far it went up 5,000% having two in 2016 leading up to it 142% now there's dips along the way and we're seeing that right now but then a year after that in 2017 2 84% in 2020 even though there was a turbulent year like we talked about it was still up 17% for the year getting into that having in May I think it was May 12 2020 and then it went up almost five almost 600% the year after that and we can see here that that yeah same thing happened the year leading up to to the having on November 208th 2012 this is what Bitcoin was 250 and then of course we come up and then you can see right here that yes there is a a drop before that and then it comes up and there's a drop before but it's like the same thing as like a bull market so we're seeing the same thing kind of Replay I know it's a funny thing because like Ben you'll say like uh you say hey I I I told you that the Bitcoin ethereum evaluation was going to start to start to lose momentum or actually bleed away to ethereum and then people were going to blame a Black Swan event and they never would have saw it coming but here we are and again same thing happens here 2015 a year going into it yes it's not a straight line but we kind of I mean really rallied into it there's you know dips along the way but I mean it's going in that right direction and then of course 2019 to 2020 we started at 7325 we had it kind of flat and then we saw the almighty Corona virus right here but then we rallied into it so I still feel like the same thing's gonna Happ happen that's just how I see things and I'm I'm feeling pretty good about this having so far but the big question is and and we we'll talk about this later is what's the macro is there going to be quantitative easing or more quantitative Tiding are they actually going to cut rates are we going to have the liquidity that we absolutely need which we had beforehand even though we're in quantitative uh tightening right now I mean we still rallied pretty well but can we get that liquidity back in the market and that's I think that's the big question on top of the fact of are we going to see World War II so yeah that's where I got yeah it's interesting because you know at some point you would think we would need to make the shift from quantitative tightening to quantity to quantitative easing but what needs to trigger that shift is the is the is the thing that I I think we're kind of wrestling with um someone asked where a guy was I I should have mentioned that he's he's in Dubai and I mean there's obviously a lot of stuff going on right there going on right now there with the conference and um everything so he wasn't able to make it this week um so um Max I I'll put the same question to you I mean like what are your thoughts here on the Bitcoin having um is this just kind of the same old thing that we've seen before and everyone's trying to over complicate it uh do you see any kind of shifts coming after after the having what are your thoughts yeah I I would agree with the with the last part I think that a majority of people and it's very easy to do this I I tend to do it all the time is to sort of chronically over complicate something that has for over a decade now been a pretty reliable uh we'll just we'll call it a risk on event and in the simplest of terms all you need to do is you know pull up your trading view chart and Mark out every single Bitcoin having right you need at this point you know you need to draw four vertical lines whenever a Bitcoin having has occurred look at the the price action that has basically come almost immediately following so um you know I I try to look at this thing from Every Which angle you know I look at it from the side I look at it up side down I you know I try to include the macro and and fed policy in all of my decisionmaking but um you know the truth of the matter is this is a very unique time to be in the markets right Bitcoin is now on the global stage in my opinion for the first time um there is you know new on-ramps into crypto you know specifically being these you know nine ETFs um and it is you know there's more regulatory Clarity the accounting standards have shift did in a positive light and are working to you know become more friendly for corporations and big money to actually onboard into this digital commodity if they choose to do so um but again like Rob had mentioned and Ben like you commented on there also are some macro headwinds which can only be ignored for so long unfortunately I am of the belief that we do still have some time I believe we're maybe on borrowed time some people probably don't like to hear that but but I do believe that there is this this unique pocket of time where it's all coming together and we can really see risk perform um positively of course I don't have to tell you guys this and I probably don't have to tell the audience this but historically during a Fed pause until something has quote unquote kind of broken and we see Unemployment uh you know trending above 4% and the FED actually has to step in and begin easing through you know interest rate cuts and other measures um we can actually see risk you know being stocks and now crypto performed tremendously well and you know going back to you know to the last cycle you know we actually kind of went through a little mini fed cycle here and you know 2018 2019 and 2020 um you know where Bitcoin actually the floor kind of gave out we dropped to about 3K and then we had that famous rally into June of 2019 when we topped um you know there was actually hikes going into that and then of course right as Bitcoin basically topped in June of 2019 the FED began to actually cut rates um more or less right after that and it did dramatically affect Bitcoin some will say you know it was a reflexivity and you know we had to you know we we sprung hard off of that local floor so you know of course the market corrects to the downside some will say it's covid some will say it was in the charts the whole time some will say it's not I don't know you know nobody knows whether it would have happened with Co or or without um but again I don't think that this time really is that much different I think that every cycle has some distinct differences from from a previous one I mean for example last cycle we had a double top we haven't had a true double top before we have had a cycle like the 2013 one where we had you know two pronounced Peaks but a true double top had never happened before and additionally in the bare Market we had never spent as much time below the 200 WEA as we just did coming out of this most recent bear so there are you know of course Very recognizable and notable differences of every cycle but you to answer the question Point Blank I don't think that this time is much different and I I'm trying my best to not overthink it um and say you know what there is no reason for the FED to intervene at this point we're trending in that direction and we are on borrowed time there is a Day of Reckoning coming but I do believe at the earliest it's probably sometime in Q4 we have the having you know in less than two days and I do believe that there's plenty of room for risk to run in the short to Middle term maybe going out six months okay yeah no I mean it's great to get you guys opinions um and the market has been on an absolute tear I mean essentially after since October right I mean it was pretty boring summer last year but then since October uh the market has basically just been up only up until the last few weeks but um you know the next thing I'd like to talk about is of course Rob's absolutely favorite topic and it's of course Bitcoin dominance um and you know I you know you guys know My Views but I always like to get other other views because you know I'm I it's it's a good idea not to live in an echo chamber so Bitcoin dominance has once again broken a new highs I I we saw 57% actually it came really really quickly really quickly you know that that move to 57% it's kind of cooled off back you know it's back down to like the 55 like 55 and a half or so so it has cooled off quite a bit since that rally up to 57% uh so uh Max I'll start with you first on this one do you think it's going to keep going up after the having um you know it was it it was going up into the spot ETF and then it kind of waned a little bit following the spot ETF but then it just kind of picked right back up so what do you think is gonna happen this time and and this kind of goes to the whole like the last question as well like will there be a narrative shift and what people are focused on will they will they start focusing on more things besides you know sticking with Bitcoin um do you see you know what are your thoughts on that Max well first I have to give you a compliment Ben because you were one of the few people that with a big following publicly called Bitcoin dominance rallying to this point I didn't expect it to get up to I think it topped at what 57 recently or wherever did you you deserve a lot of credit for that well I'm known for riding Trends too long see well we'll see right nobody knows besides the market right like you know we we all have our our inclinations but uh you deserve a lot of credit because I remember months and months AG I don't it was probably six months ago plus we did a space together or you came on on my my channel because Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance was significantly lower and eth BTC was significantly higher and much has changed since then so kudos to you where do I think it goes from here so I think that Bitcoin dominance is in the process of we'll call it distribution okay I believe believe that the meat of the move is over um but that does not preclude it from going a little bit higher than here maybe maybe 60% that's not my base case but you know let's let's look left on the chart and you know use that to you know maybe forecast what could happen next so ignoring the you know whether this is a left translated cycle or an expedited cycle let's look at it contextually for where Bitcoin is at um you know from from a a p perspective right so Bitcoin actually has gone on to get above the previous cycle all-time high of 69k so most comparably again ignoring everything else but just pure levels on the chart pure you know where was the cycle High where was the cycle low you could probably compare Bitcoin right now to like December of 2020 okay if we just ignore everything else and say okay Bitcoin in December of 2020 went on to sweep the previous cycle all-time high of 197 it paused there for what maybe a month or or something like that it was chopping around altcoins got destroyed during that time right Bitcoin uncertainty like you always preach Ben uh when Bitcoin is uncertain alts get absolutely eviscerated and we are seeing that once again right so um again comparing this period of time to December of 2020 there is turbulence under the previous cycle all-time high which is not uncommon we saw that again last cycle and then also two cycles ago it seems to be sort of the same thing happening again what did we see in December of 2020 well what we saw was Bitcoin dominance basically put in a deviation or bull trap High where on when Bitcoin finally decided it was time to push through with conviction above the previous cycle all-time high of 197 you saw Bitcoin dominance put in an explosive move which ultimately ended up being sort of a bull trap you know for for the Bitcoin Maxis um so I I think it's possible we are seeing that Devi that deviation high right now only time will tell um I do have hedges in place you know like I'm I'm holding some Bitcoin l2s like STX and some Bitcoin ordinals and things like that that I think would be beneficiaries of you know Bitcoin dominance continued rally maybe above 60% um but of course you know I I really I am of the belief that contextually with Bitcoin chopping under the previous cycle all-time high seeing similar signs of Bitcoin dominance putting in you know this this last explosive push I do believe that over the next six months or so it would probably makes sense to see Bitcoin dominance Trend down dramatically and additionally and and I don't mean to you know bring this up because I don't know if this is on the agenda today exactly I imagine that that would translate to eth BTC finding a bottom sooner rather than later but that doesn't again preclude it from going down a little bit more and only time will tell yeah no I mean it's great and I mean I I I think it's always worthwhile to hear these other views because um you know no one really knows right I mean you know no one really knows and you know one thing that I've wrestled with a lot before and I've seen other people do this too is like you know just because someone gets something right doesn't mean they're going to be right they're going to keep being right right and also just because someone gets something wrong doesn't mean they're GNA be keep being wrong I mean you know markets change no one knows what's going to happen and I I I could see eth Bitcoin carving out a bottom this summer um that's kind of my base case I could see that actually happening so we'll see if that happens Rob what are your thoughts I mean I know you're you're more of a you're more of a Bitcoin Maxi yourself right Bitcoin dominance to 100% I yes exactly go ahead Ben what was your question I'm just kidding I'm just kidding what what are your thoughts here on on on dominance do you think it's uh you think we're getting pretty close to the uh to the top well first of all let me just say that I I I was like listening to to Max especially on like the Twitter spaces and things like that he's very smooth in his delivery and very smart and and what he talks about so I gotta tell you it's good to hear like different sets of opinions it's great to have a Max here so to talk about I mean Bitcoin dominance I got to tell you like when you were talking the 60% I'm like yeah you know I can kind of see it you know I was I was I was under the assumption like well you know it always kind of comes back that way right something happens there's something that happens in the market a Black Swan event or you know something that's just that kind of has disruption and then people get scared and they're they're like okay I'm risk on but not that risk on to go into like you know Pepe coin I'm gonna go into the safest asset in the most volatile industry which would be Bitcoin and I I could see that for sure but then like there's a narrative that that people are always talking about especially in in in the crypto space being the Bitcoin maxos are going to say Bitcoin only right but there are narratives that are out there one of those is dpin Right centralized physical infrastructure Network the other one are dexes because we see what's going on with the centralized exchanges getting sued getting their pants sued off by the SEC and then leaving of course so we have to have dexes and then of course there's another big one which is web 3 so we talk about that but there's one that I feel is on an undertone and Max alluded to it when he was talking about it when he talked about runes and he talked about ordinals and he talked about things like stacks and l2s and I think what's gonna really push Bitcoin dominance up I know Ben loves this part too is uh the the l2s or even l1s that are going to be built on bitcoin Ben if you just throw this this chart up I always talk about this website it's l2. watch so imagine this and I and and and even like Adam back has talked about this how he's talked about he hates the fact that everybody's building off of Bitcoin people should just build on bitcoin because he says it's like it's it's like the tcpip layer for for the internet so why can't they just build on the most the safest most secured Network or computerized Network ever built in the entire world and he was right so when I take a look at these these l2s that are coming out and they're all new so you I to understand like this some most of these are trash let's just let's just call it SP Spade but like when we talk about things that are coming out that are actually doing pretty good like a Stax who's been around for quite some time I can really see things actually happening for sure and then like I just dropped a a video on my second Channel where I talked about core core is a top uh 50 well it's 56 now but it's essentially an L1 L2 type of uh uh token which is built right on top of Bitcoin using delegated proof of work and delegated proof of stake together to actually make dexes nfts and a whole host of things you can only do with smart contracts so when I see stuff like this happening I'm like why can't we take away the nonsense that's going on over in ethereum world and they're massive gas fees like just like with with core and stacks right now if you use it or the things that are being built on top of it they're just going through their Satoshi initiative it's super cheap and it's super fast so for me to see that Bitcoin dominance could go up why couldn't it especially with the different institutions that are here and how they've been drilled into it now they can say oh there's something else I can do and also smart I see it could actually go above 60% but again I'm not always right no I mean I I've it's possible it's certainly possible um I think the answer is going to probably come in the next few weeks because you know there's two prior examples where we had these kind of these like closes below the 8we ese 2021 and 2019 and in 2021 after it happened Bitcoin got a rally eth Bitcoin went up but in 2019 when Bitcoin got that rally eth Bitcoin went down so I think if we see Bitcoin get some type of relief I don't know maybe sometime after the having into may I I don't know exactly when it would be but whenever that comes whatever happens to eth bitcoin should be very telling about where we are in the cycle so I I'm going to be focused a lot on that um over the next few weeks but we will see um next question Rob I'm GNA start with you on this one to rotate and you know I remember last year you saying something like this um and and you ended up being correct it was basically you know sell and man go away um like I mean no one's D Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear since October I mean you know I mean it was basically like 25 to 30k not even that long ago um and I I think sometimes we forget just how quickly it has moved so I'm curious like do you think it's going to be similar to last summer where we just get the market gets boring before maybe moving up again like later in the year or something you think it's just going to get boring for a few months um do you think or on the other hand do you think everyone's gonna get think it's boring and then we just get another you know face what's it called like a face melting Rally or something that's exactly face yeah I mean like so so what are your thoughts going into the summer because I mean again I know last summer you you thought it was going to be boring do you think it's going to be boring again this summer or you think it's going to be different Matt well first of all I I hope so I I really do because everybody who's in the chat right now answer a question for me uh tell me if you think that you've accumulated enough where you're like you know what I've bought plenty of Bitcoin and I just cannot handle any more bags I just I don't want to buy anymore especially if it goes down and gets cheaper just let me know in the comment section because it seems like when these types of things Ben when you say things are boring this is great because this is when people who like the dollar cost average is fantastic or if you're Dynamic DCA is things go down which I think where we at the risk levels now 0.6 0.59 somewhere around there a little yeah I think a little above 0 six so like if we're in this place we're like well I mean for me this is a good time to just accumulate a little bit but as we start to like if it goes sideways well great I have more time to bring things in but then if you if you want to talk about selling May and go away there's this great chart on this website that I steal from constantly and if you just take a look because it's it's yeah it's a nice website it's very nice I think there's a sale going on until like tomorrow and then it goes away so but if if you say sell in May and go away it it actually works out pretty well I mean historically speaking but then if you really want to break it down because people say but Rob you don't get it because this is the having year so it's all it doesn't really it count well if you take a look at it I mean if you sold at the end of May of 2020 I mean you had a 30% increase on January a couple of drops there 34 and 10% and then you're down here and you just kind of stay away until October and then you buy in and then October rallies November rallies and December rallies that's not bad I mean I'll take that year right and if we go back to 2016 I mean it's the same type of thing if I want to sell in May okay well June's gonna go up but I have red red I take I stay away September as well and I I buy back in October November December I'm doing pretty good so I still think it can work out all right the thing that you have to understand though and one more thing is is this there's a presidential election I think this is going to be pretty tumultuous as we get into it so there was this piece from hbk's wealth and it talked about the presidential election years versus the non-election as far as returns and this is just taking a look at the S&P 500 you can see that in the presidential election years which this is that year it sends to like kind of peek off around March April and then just kind of fall away until we get into junisha may go away October is here you buy back in and then we have a nice little rally of course drop here and then off we go but 10% for that year is not too bad now does that mean that I'm going to sell everything no no I'm just telling you these are just the data points that we can say take a look at me personally I'm just here to accumulate and uh get into some early round type of cryptos that could either make a lot of money or go to zero one of those two will always happen yeah I was looking at this um this is uh this is the S&P 500 in 2024 compared to the average of all election years right I mean so you can see like it has come down a lot recently but it also went up a lot too like way more than it does on average so there's just been a lot more volatility this cycle than I think we've seen in a lot of Prior Cycles um but yeah I I thought that was interesting and that chart sort of reminded me of that uh Max what are your thoughts here I mean I know earlier you said you expected uh risk to do pretty well um over the next six months but you know even with that do you think that the market could cool off before that phase or do you think it's not going to really get much of a breather or do you think the Breather is almost over yeah that's it's a it's a great question of course we're all from relatively familiar with the uh maybe cliche but overused but also kind of accurate saying of sell and may go away um one thing that I've been preaching for a while going back to I mean even I would say Q4 of last year is that I was seeing signs early on of a maybe expedited cycle for crypto um and it's probably off of of you know the back of this this fed paw and there isn't quite as much in my opinion economic deterioration as a lot had thought myself included and we're in this you know kind of Goldilocks window where risk can rally really unencumbered um you know so so do I think that selling may go away will come to fruition I I would think that worst case in my opinion from what I'm seeing right now and again of course subject to change it's just one man on the internet's opinion I think that similarly to how this cycle for crypto is being a little bit front Rand and we've actually seen for the first time a Bitcoin all-time high before a having which of course had never happened before um I also think it's possible that selling may go away is being front ran a little bit and we're seeing that right now with this April correction so similarly to Rob I am not I am not in the camp of you know drisking or selling spot because again like I mentioned in you know during our first question here if you just draw four vertical lines on your trading View and Mark out every Bitcoin having look what typically happens in the six to nine months following Additionally you know for a lot of us that have been slowly you know and thoroughly meticulously dcing into our digital digital assets and our unregistered Securities over the past year you know a lot of us have tax consequences for selling right now and I'm I'm not really interested in incurring any uh you know tax consequences trying to reposition because May perhaps is a little bit choppy so in my opinion you know and again going back you know the past 18 months for Bitcoin we haven't seen more than a 22% correction on bitcoin so from our local high recently take it down 22 to 25% maybe you get 57 56 worst case that's not enough for me to incur you know a taxable event to try to reposition so uh maybe it happens maybe it doesn't but for me ultimately it doesn't make a big difference because the having is in a couple days um and typically what happens after a having is months and months of prosperity and hopefully price discovery yeah no it's a fair point I mean I think like all the corrections that we've had by Bitcoin for the entire bull market have only been about 20 to 22% yeah we've already seen it go down about what 18% or so um so that I think that'll be the the area I mean if we get down there see if it turns around and if it does maybe the time's not different you know but yeah what do you think Ben do you think selling May and go away will come to ahead um I think now I mean so I so we went into the 7 to point8 risb in March so that I think was the time to to drisk some kind of like during the spot ETF um at this point it's kind of like when we went back to 39K after the spot ETF um we then it was it was a 22% drop and then we just rallied after it right and and so I was like you know this could be our preh having year dip and then the rally just continued and so now it's kind of the same thing it's like you know the the area to do it if you were convinced about it would have been in in March you know um when gold broke out because that's actually in 2019 when Bitcoin topped was when gold broke out um so I think that would have been the time to do it now I do think there is a risk of if you've waited if you've waited till this point and now bitcoin's down 20% we did see both in after the 20209 or the 2019 top and the 2021 top the first weekly close bow of the 8we SMA we then had a rally back up you know to the we right which is around 67k we actually went slightly above it in both cases so I think what what's more important is not exactly what happens here at the range lows but it's what happens whenever we get a relief move does it sustain or does it just put in a lower high I think that is kind of the thing to look for because back in after the spot ETF it wasn't a lower high we just you know had another face ripping rally fire um the the reason why I am more cautious on this one than than the last one is because eth Bitcoin has now broken down and gold is broken out which both of those events marked the 2019 local top and it wasn't the market cycle top and this kind of goes back to what Rob was saying you know there is this idea of a left translated peak in 2024 and I can sort of like I'm like 30% maybe 40% aware of that like you know thinking hey this is this could actually happen you know if if we were to Rally into the summer to higher prices without cooling off then I would be very more so convinced of a left translated Peak but what if what if if you think about what happened after the 2019 top after gold broke out and after e Bitcoin broke down Bitcoin went into a six to n month bare Market in fact now imagine you get that after the having and everyone thinks the cycle is over by the end of 2024 because it just hasn't done anything since the having and then we just get another move in 2025 and then the cycle Peaks when it always does and once again everyone over complicated it you know like there is a chance that that that happens um so I would I think I would just watch to see what happens whenever we get any type of relief does it form into a lower high or does it lead to a higher high and then you probably have your answer to whether it's a left translit cycle or not at that point I can see absolutely yeah and again even in 2019 it was it was just a local top we bled for a while we actually bled back to the 100 we SMA um and then and then we started to go back back up and then we had the we had the pandemic crash but if you ignore that it was just sort of a bleed after all Bitcoin pairs broke down and then and then once we got that back you know we start to go back up those are my and and by the way I mean you've always said this going back when you know before I started my business and I was watching all of your videos you know years ago Ben you used to always say something kind of along the lines of you know the longer it takes you know the higher will ultimately go something along those lines and you know I think a uh this idea of a prolonged sort of midcycle Correction freaks a lot of people out because everybody wants to be rich overnight myself included right of course i' I'd love for us to just go straight up in a straight line and I hope that we do but ultimately I don't think it would be a death sentence for Bitcoin to kind of reestablish value between 55 and 75k for even a full quarter um you know I think ultimately would probably lead to more constructive uh price action to the upside in the long run but people you know their patients will be tested no question yeah yeah I mean I think the the the thing to look for in the cycle I think is is the Bitcoin dominance I I really do think it's the key for the cryptoverse and I think I think that dominance will Top before Bitcoin Falls below the 20we SMA that's my guess is that it's going to top before Bitcoin Falls below it and I think between now and then Bitcoin gets occasional rallies that just take off Bitcoin pairs even lower is my guess um so that's why I just say like you know if you want exposure to crypto Bitcoin I mean you know Bitcoin is is a relatively safe bet if you want to take on more risk there's obviously the altcoin market there's the full DJ mcoin Market um but you have to be careful with those and I I I think the winning strategy with the altcoin market and and even if you are in the riskier memec coin stuff is just to remember like in five years that Meme coin is probably not going to exist No One's Gonna care about it because they're going to be worried about the next stage of mean points right so the way the way to navigate it is it's okay to have exposure to various parts if you want to take more risk but just occasionally convert it back to bitcoin if you make a lot of money right because at least you know you then know hey Bitcoin is still going to be around in 10 years I don't know if this random meme coin is Ben how could you say that how dare you my a meme coins oh my I think I've converted most of my audience to bitcoin Maxis at this point but I will say by the time I convince the last person to be a Bitcoin Maxi that's when the dominance tops out and we go back the other way I don't think we're that far away I think maybe this summer dominance tops out we'll see though but you are correct like what anybody out there like if we're being completely honest Would You Bet Your Life that Your Meme coin or your altcoin is going to be around in 50 years would You Bet Your Life on it I probably would not would I bet my life I mean it's an extreme example right would I bet my life or something valuable that Bitcoin will be around bet your would you bet all your money on it or something right that's much more friendly right so and I would for Bitcoin I have a high degree of confidence and that's why your strategy ultimately it's conservative you know relative to a lot of other people that you know talk about crypto publicly but it is ultimately a long-term winning strategy and people need to recognize that profits from altcoins ultimately do have to flow back into Bitcoin that is the sustainable strategy for sure yeah I mean I think Rob I think Rob was talking about this what last week on NFA live we were talking about like what do you do when you get an airdrop and I think what was your strategy like just 50% you take profits on it right away 50% back to bitcoin or USD and then you let there oh no no it was you let let it go up 2X or something or if it goes up 2x then you sell 50% was that what you said yeah I I call it well two things I call it the half and half method so you get into meme coins or something crazy and then let's say you put it you know 100 bucks in and then it goes $200 so then you sell half immediately and you put the other hundred bucks let it ride because that's house money then when it doubles or triples or or quadruples then you take half again or you take two or three or 4X what do you want to do and then you let the ride and you do that until there's no more riding and it just goes away and then you're like well okay I I did 8X but it went to zero so I don't feel so bad because a lot of people just let it go all the way up and all the way down but if you just play with house money there's a reason why like like I I can see people in the in the chats going well this sucks because you know now we're gonna sideways and you know this isn't what I want to be there's a reason why all three of us are pretty much just like on all of our videos on all of our Twitter spaces we're pretty much the same person whether it goes massively up or way way down me's a little bit of excitement but it's because we der risked enough to like well if this happens then we do this if this happens we do that and I think that's where people should would want to be as opposed to just going okay I sold my kidney I hope this memec coin goes up it's one of those things have a plan no matter what and then enjoy your life don't stress about it right I mean have a plan like you know if Bitcoin goes to 50K or even lower so what have a plan if it goes up have a plan I mean it I I think you know I used to navigate crypto without without thinking about like what do I do if this happens I only would navigate it based on one particular outcome I never hedge myself but once I started hedging My Views then it makes things easier you know you're like all right well this is what I think but if I'm wrong I don't want to be you know completely left out of whatever that next trend is um and when I when I get air drops um well I don't I don't really get air drops anymore because I'm not really that active in in the space but when I did when I used to get air drops my strategy was immediately convert half of it to bitcoin at least half to bitcoin and then let whatever else ride because like half the time they would just go to zero anyways um so at least you get some of that value out in inss um why don't we goe and move on because we do have two more questions and then I'd also like to get to audience questions at the end if you post your question now I probably won't see it so maybe wait like 10 minutes and then post it um this is an interesting question and I to be completely honest most people aren't going to care but gold is is one of these things where like it doesn't do anything for like 10 years you know and like if you think about this entire bitcoin's like like it's entire history essentially since 2009 gold has essentially gone nowhere in that in that entire phase but we just saw gold break to new all-time highs and it seems to be a somewhat explosive rally so I'm curious about what your thoughts are on gold um I I often think that people who like gold are are more alike to people who like Bitcoin than they would care to admit I think the main difference is the generation that we are right so if I were born one or two generations ago I probably would have been really into gold you know but because I'm born into more of the digital age I'm more into Bitcoin so I think we're more alike than different um so I'm curious like what your thoughts are on gold here it is now 2300 2400 um max where do you you know do you think that uh this is going to continue I me Silver is also not too far behind it in its own move um and I guess the other question is like why do you think gold is rallying so that's probably the bigger question is is why do you think it's rallying rather than like what do you think it's going to go to sure yeah the gold strength is um pronounced it's very impressive um and and I would say I mean why do people buy gold historically right it's sound money it was sound money before Bitcoin it was a store of value when you know our our parents generation was nervous about the state of the world they would you know convert their into gold and uh you know a lot of it is more of a um it's a mental thing it's a it's a mental insulation it's not like if your country was invaded you're going to put you know 500 pounds of gold on your back and somehow travel to another country right but it's a it's a peace of mind thing you know and you know again historically it is you know a sound currency uh there is a scarcity aspect to it there's a lot of commonality and overlap between gold and Bitcoin and I think everything you mentioned Ben is correct um I would say that my bias on gold um really stems more on my perspective and my my forecast on where I think dxy is headed and similarly where I think Bitcoin is headed I've already shared my opinion on where I think Bitcoin is going we have the Bitcoin having just around the corner um I expect Bitcoin to you Trend upwards aggressively over the next six to nine months subsequently I do believe that dxy is forming a sort of distribute you know a distribution here I do anticipate dxy topping very soon and again if you just overlay gold with dxy on a weekly chart you can see that there is a pretty prominent negative correlation between dxy and gold so I don't think we're I'm not of the opinion that we're going to see a decoupling where there's suddenly a a prolonged period of a positive correlation where gold rallies and dxy rallies I think that one of them is lying so either gold is lying or dxy is lying I think that gold is leading and going to see dxy of course sort of reclaim that negative correlation and begin to take a dive over the next quarter so um I do expect gold to continue upwards and I think it's probably off the back of the you know dxy weakening okay yeah fair enough um it has it has been really strong you know and I I can't help but look at it I'm like wow you have like a 10-year base I the bigger the base the more explosive the rally and for I mean for I know like all the crypto you know Deens are like you know it's up what like 10% or something and like people are like you know like 10% is like a minute candle on a meme coin right but for gold you know for an asset that's that high market cap like that is a big move in a really short period of time and so like that's why it it it means something Rob what are your thoughts here um are you are you are you watching this gold move I'm not watch I mean but I own it I own gold and silver and I I think and I don't I never UND and we talk about this many times I never understood why the old maximalists and this and the precious metal maximalists hate Bitcoin so much because like you said we're trying to all do the same thing we're trying to get out of the Matrix which is relying on paper Fiat and it just seems like I there's there's that one gold bug guy that is what we all talk about for some god- awful reason but in reality I think for the majority of people that are into precious metals I think they can see the value behind it and of of of Bitcoin itself and like I I like I never understood with this guy like why don't we have a debate between that guy and like Mike Maloney Mike Maloney is huge into gold he's put out a great series on precious medals and he's he likes Bitcoin as well so like when I take a look at this I I think you know why why not own why not old gold why not diversify like you know uh we've got I diversify not just in the crypto but the stocks precious metals and and real estate and I think everybody should do the you know kind of do the same thing but to talk about why gold went up so much let me I I don't know but how did gold do in 2022 was there any kind of rally during that time I mean it it it it still mostly stayed below the high I don't really think it did that well um it's only recently really started to show strength I mean I can I can pull it up and see but 2022 was kind of split it rallied in the first half of the year and then didn't really do too much and actually corrected a little bit looks like yeah I mean it looks like it topped in March of 2022 and then basically just went down yeah till November and then it rallied again into December kind of there there's a theory going around about why Gold's rallying so much it's because the Nations that are going to war they are trying they're fearful of us sanctions so how do how do you get away get around those sanctions well you stockpile Alternatives and one of those would be of course gold so people are talking about how Iran could be could have stockpiled after the Damascus situation and the and the bombing and the reason why I ask about 2022 is because for the Ukraine Invasion I think was February 2022 and the same type of thing was being said about Russia stockpiling gold at the same time so I can see I can kind of see that that valuation I don't know why they don't just use Bitcoin it's a heck of a lot easier to transfer and zip around value but that's where we're at yeah I always like I always think those posts by the gold bugs are so disingenuous because I mean like I I own both like I own Bitcoin and gold but like if you go to trading View and you look at the Bitcoin or you look at the Gold valuation against Bitcoin it's down so much since Bitcoin launched that it rounds it to negative 100% like like that's how far the valuation of gold has fallen against Bitcoin since Bitcoin has been around so again like it's not it's just look I mean the the Bitcoin valuation as far exceeded gold for a long time um I mean my guess is over the next 20 years Bitcoin will still outperform gold you know maybe in the short term gold could outperform uh Bitcoin but and I I mean I guess it has been since March right ever since gold broke out Gold's been doing better than even the S&P 500 even the NASDAQ um it's been having my view is that I I I think that gold is breaking out because it senses that um rate cuts are coming sooner than the market is potentially thinking and so that's kind of why I think I I think it's sort of sniffing something out just like it did in 2019 and and um but we'll see I mean you know we'll see if it if it plays out in the same way last question and I mean I you know this is more so geared towards Max um because I mean Rob is I mean you know you've been around here forever we' probably even asked this question you before yeah but I mean if you want to take it if you want to answer you can Max Max yeah so since you're new here um why did you start your YouTube channel I mean like what what was your motivation what are you helping to accomplish with it uh what brings you here well Ben you you actually played a big role in in bringing me here I was a very early follower of yours actually before you even had your website I bought your Google sheet way back in the day and I'm still locked into my original price thank you very much because I got in early pays to get in early um you know I I learned a lot from you in the very beginning and I went through last cycle and you know Ben and and Rob also this you know this is a compliment to both of you guys amongst a sea of grifters and thieves and people looking to prey on unsuspecting retail you know guys like yourselves you you conducted yourselves in a manner that you know I mean I can't even imagine how many millions of dollars you guys turn down from shill deals and you know crap like that and you know I I wanted to in the beginning play my you know play my part in that I felt as though I had opinions that you know um I could share something to offer I have you know I have an ability to lead I have you know an ability to organize a team um and I wanted to play my my part my equal share in the sort of collective hive mind of you know CT and and YouTube and help educate that's sort of the underpinning of of what I'm doing is I like to teach I like to collaborate and you know making money certainly feels nice right but there's a certain there's a certain sense of fulfillment that I personally get out of somebody messaging me saying hey because of what you said it made a difference in my life and something clicked for me and that feels really good and you know I I started because Bitcoin and it was it's a small Channel still um we're growing quickly certainly which of course if you go to Ben's beautiful website and you overlay social media growth with uh you know the price of Bitcoin you can see why I'm starting to grow quicker it's it's I'm doing the same thing I was doing all bare Market it's just suddenly more people care about crypto so um you know I am a i a result of good times and I pray that they continue on because of course it's you know a nice Tailwind for for my young business but yeah I mean really to answer the question Point Blank I love to teach I love to to collaborate and I love to debate you know like I have a differing opinion than you know you guys for some things and there's some overlap but that's what makes a market beautiful is that you can think one thing I can think another and we can come together and just talk about it politely and nobody knows what's going to happen right like we can't I have my hunch I have conviction just like you guys do but Bitcoin dominance could go to 90% And you know even over flip it and put that on on Twitter don't do that don't do that or or it could literally nuke down to 10% we could have like the crypto equivalent of the NASDAQ bubble between 1995 and 2000 where altcoins bubble like people you know can't imagine everybody's thrown money at altcoins speculating anything that's crypto and then 99 out of 100 of them don't exist in a couple years you know so who who knows what's going to happen but yeah I love to to collaborate and teach and debate and uh generally it's it's just a passion of mine how many subscribers are you guys at now like 13 14k or something yes on YouTube somewhere in between there yeah well there's 3,600 people watching so if everyone here goes and clicks the link in the description below and goes over to Max's Channel and subscribes then uh I I'm sure he would appreciate that and I think he deserves that he's been they've been putting out they it's not just Max by the way I mean it's a team of people um so go check that out you guys do like daily live streams right we Yeah we actually have a show coming up at uh 10:00 a.m. eastern time we do a Daily Show we've got a panel of Five Guys we're all just Traders wrap this one up then if you got it coming up in 10 minutes that's okay I got a big team they got it all right well before we before we end it here I I did want to take at least a couple of questions um and one of the questions I saw was um what is the best way to learn about crypto and to do your own research so I mean I don't know if they're talking about like from a fundamental perspective but I if someone were getting into crypto like like what do you guys use to do your research and I mean and maybe talk about like all the different tool or some at least some of the bigger tools that you guys have been using especially for all the different things that are happening in the cryptoverse there seems like there's a thousand different narratives that you could you know that you could follow and whoever wants to take that one is fine go ahead Max yeah um I would start on uh one of our three channels I think that's a really good place not to not to spew the obvious but um I would say I would say learn to do very basic ta right and understand Cycles like there's some very awesome free indicators out there like I mean you can even just look at like you know Ben has a a you he's kind of coined a very famous one he's combined a 20 week SMA and a 21 we EMA which has been sort of uh marketed as the bull market band for good reason right so you can determine when you know Bitcoin is trending upwards High time frame or trending down by just a simple you moving average band there's also things like the P Cycle top which I think people should keep an eye on which is again a free trading view indicator someone someone made it it's also on Ben's website there's also some some good onchain stuff like you know Bitcoin terminal price hoddle waves things like that I would as a beginner I would stay off the hourly time frame like literally just go daily time frame and above um and whenever you see Bitcoin down you know 50% from its its all-time high that's time to start paying attention to maybe consider entering the market but you know learn very very basic ta and and some of the more popular onchain indicators can really help you just DCA at the right time you know but stay off of the hourly time frames mainly the py cycle top just to give credit is uh was developed by Philip Swift um a while back and I the the idea was to predict the top with within 3 days and it did a really great job of doing that in the first uh the first 2021 Peak um and it actually happened I remember it happening and like no one really believed it you know um but I think it was retrofit right it was fit after yeah it was created in 2019 it was created in 2019 okay but it did it did get the first top in 2021 I feel like a lot of these like metrics that everyone created in 2019 uh it they called the first top but then most of them like didn't really call the second top because it was just sort of like a it was like a dead cat bounce that just somehow made it to New highs you know yeah um so yeah that was kind of an interesting one um Rob did you have anything to add just yeah just one thing Max makes all great points the thing I would say is that if you really knew you really really knew you have to understand that it's not how much you make it's how much you keep and the big thing is that you have to watch out for scams and things to watch out for and if you're gonna get into like hot storage wallets stuff like that there's a there's a video in the in the link of in the description of all my videos and it says you know things you the the big mistakes in crypto and it has like 20,000 views and of course it's the most important video I probably have ever put out because that's what people get screwed out and they get scammed out and if they watch that video they wouldn't happen to them another video I did when I'm gonna sell on my crypto has over 100,000 views so it just goes to show you like where the priorities are the priorities are make money but really the priority should be keep money someone's asking a um this the Market's not pricing it in right now but I did see like last night there's been a couple of times here where like there's at least some in investors like thinking about a rate hike um that is not like my base case at all like I think they're done I I think five and a half percent is the terminal rate for this cycle they might go higher next cycle uh but I I think five and a half percent at the top I'm not going to ask you if you think they're gonna hike again because I don't really think any of us think they're going to um if you do think that let me know but I guess my main question is what do you think would happen if they did hike again um because that be I mean that would talk about markets not pricing it in right I mean like I guess the the implication would be like if if the economy just accelerates into you know again and and there's not a cool down and we just keep on moving up uh what would a rate what would another rate hike do well what was real quick what was what is what has Jerome Powell said about fighting inflation do they say that they're on the right track or do they say like there's it's more more stubborn what he they've kind of like the progress has slowed a lot and I I think they've kind of specul that it it might influence their the number of rate Cuts this year because previously they had said three rate Cuts this year and I'm I'm wondering if they're starting to walk I mean now the market is pricing in only two rate cuts through April of 2025 so I my view is that you know I thought higher for longer but now that everyone else believes it I think I think it's going to go back the other way because once the market fully prices in no rate Cuts that's when people give up and you need to start having some rate cuts um but yeah I don't know I mean pal Po's basically said the same thing he said for the last three years if you know they're they're going to keep rates higher for longer until inflation's durably going back to 2% yeah I I think that 3% is is the new 2% truthfully I I I appreciate their narrative and their consistency and and how they haven't wavered on that and I think it's a great goal um but it seems like three is kind of a magnet actually a little above three um like you mentioned they are currently pricing in now it looks like you know our first 25 basis point cut on the uh September 18th meeting and then through April 2025 and and these percentages change all the time right uh you know we'll see what happens um you know potentially taking us down 50 basis points off of where we're currently at um let me answer your question what would happen if we got another 25 basis point hike because you know inflation decides it's going to rear its ugly head again and and start trending up above you know headline four 5% God forbid it's over I mean like we are going to absolutely nuke if we get another rate I'm gonna be as as clear as I can be if we get another rate hike markets are going to capitulate like that will be awful horrible for risk like sell all of your assets honestly like if that happens I'm not joking I think it'd be terrible I don't know if you guys agree with me but that would be horrible for markets but I don't think that's going to happen to be clear I think you could have the same thing happen if they just refuse to cut soon enough too because like it it you know like a tightening cycle is not just raising rates but it's also keeping rates too high for too long and the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and eight would have been in March um so we've already gone nine I think there's still you know there's still a window where talks about a soft Landing right it's so hard to thread that needle to a soft Landing because you have to stay high enough to make sure inflation doesn't come back in a second wave because if you don't and you get an inflation a secondary wave like the 70s you get a hard Landing but if you stay high for too long like let's say they stay at five and a half percent for another six months then you start to run the risk of of a deflationary crash right so that's why everyone sort of rolls their eyes about a soft Landing is because it's so difficult to thread that needle and I don't I do not envy their job I I do not envy their job because it's not and and they're also operating with long and variable lags like how can they know all the effects of prior monetary policy um so yeah it's it's a tough place for them to be and and we are oh sorry Rob go ahead no no go ahead Max I was going to say you know we are seeing some smaller economies in my opinion forecasting when our rate cuts are coming like we have seen the Czech Republic actually start to cut we've seen Poland cut um so it you know historically it's not perfect right but you are starting to see some of these smaller countries actually they they LED through the hik so they began to hike first they paused first and they've actually started to cut so I I do anticipate that you know in similar fashion to what has happened historically we will see the US begin to I guess cut rates hopefully uh later this year um but I do agree with you Ben like if they held rates where they're currently at through you know all of 2024 that would also put some pressure um on our economy and our markets but with that said like I don't know what you you guys think but I mean really the the final you know real dagger or Domino to fall is going to be of course unemployment creeping up above four four and a half percent do you guys think that if they just held rates where they're currently at all through 2024 um but we didn't see the labor market really deteriorate could financial markets hold up in that instance I mean if if the labor market doesn't deteriorate sure I just think that um I mean it seems like the unemployment rate is trending up um and the the problem with with that is that it doesn't tend to move in a linear fashion right it it goes slow and then it starts to accelerate at some point and we haven't reached the acceleration phase right so there's still a chance that we can avoid it but the longer they wait the the the riskier that's going to be I think I think there's a higher probability of a rate cut this summer than the market is giving credit for I don't think it has to happen this summer but I think the right thing to do is to cut at least 25 basis points uh this summer 50 basis points something like that just uh provide something you know are you thinking in the June meeting or July meeting I mean look last cycle I know that that the altcoin market was a lens into the consumer and I know that that when alts broke down against Bitcoin and when eth broke down against Bitcoin the FED basically cut one month later um and we we have seen eth fall against Bitcoin it had a weekly close below the June low we saw madic Bitcoin uh crash below it's June 2022 low we've seen adaa Bitcoin and Dot bit coin we've seen Litecoin Bitcoin and a Bitcoin I mean so many of these altcoins are are falling off their Bitcoin support levels and you can see it with the Bitcoin dominance so I think that the pricing out of all these rate Cuts is going to cause them to get priced in because the FED does not base their decisions on what our altcoins are doing right un they don't care what I what I what I find unfortunate is that a lot of the small like companies like Mom and Pop shops a lot of them are going out of business business right now because you know rates are going up and and and times are getting harder like inflation is so high so people just can't afford as much and but the FED has to do it because all of us Deens in the in the space can't help ourselves from bidding up jpegs you know and and and leading inflation uh to to where it was so I think that it's it's kind of a tough spot to be and the FED has to stay long enough to kind of break the animal spirits but if they do it too long then you then then you run the other issue of of a deflationary um unwind and that's not really fun either I know like people are like oh I'd love to go to the store and not spend as much money but if you if prices go down that's probably not good for risk assets terrible just yeah so everybody everybody who's watching the videos remember this when when you think like okay the Bitcoin Market or the crypto Market has to do this thing it has to do this thing because it's it's been the cycle that's always done this doesn't actually work like what we just talked about just how fragile the markets actually are and just to think how things have to really go in line before you realize that oh maybe I should have taken some profits when there was uh everything was overheated just it's just something to think about because I hate people who roundtrip and uh they really should again take some profits when everything gets too hot and and one thing just to mention about rate cuts and I mean you guys probably know this rate Cuts inherently are not bearish right it's it's the underpinning as to why they are cutting rates and you know if you actually on a granular level you go and you overlay the effective federal funds rate with you know the NASDAQ or S&P 500 markets actually tend to rally for like 30 to 60 days give or take following the First Rate cut until they wake up and they realize oh crap there's economic deterioration under the surface which is why they're cutting rates and then we see these major Corrections so I think whether the first 25 basis point comes in June or the end of July meeting or I guess hopefully September um that's probably your 30 to 60-day warning truthfully whenever it comes and I don't know when it will and what about no go ahead I was going to say you're right I mean like the rate Cuts inherently are are are bullish for risk assets if they're cutting for the right reasons in 2019 while Bitcoin topped out when rate Cuts arrived the S&P 500 kept going up and you know because the mark like the the economy was not in a recession right it wasn't going into a recession they were sort of like preliminary rate Cuts You could argue that Bitcoin is more tied to financial markets today traditional markets today than it was back then because of the spot ETF so maybe it would track the S&P 500 a bit closer than it did last cycle once rate Cuts arrive but the issue is why the FED is cutting are they cutting because they're trying to get ahead of something bad that's coming or are they cutting as a reactionary thing because they just saw a really bad labor market prance and that is is when they're not bullish like that's when rate cuts are be so it all depends on Max is right it all depends on why they're cutting and and I think that it's also risky to I I I do believe that there's just as much risk to the UPS side truthfully where you know assuming that they're going to cut because there is severe economic deterioration can also be you know a very harmful strategy long term because like you mentioned the first batch of rate cuts that we saw in 2019 um you know the S&P 500 rallied out of those cuts like 15% and then of course we had our Co nuke in March which took us below you know where that that first uh cut occurred right but you know again it's like you have to be very careful you kind of threading your own needle per se because just because they're cutting doesn't mean sell everything right because they could cut you know the labor market could be more resilient than anybody's expecting the S&P 500 could go up 50% over the next year and then something bad happens and you get a correction but that correction doesn't take you down to as low as the point in which the first cut happens so you just have to be a little bit careful truthfully you know you have to really understand why they're cutting and and it's a tough thing to do it's very tough I me with the S&P you know there there's been all sorts of like crises throughout all the decades but if you just pull up a chart over a 100 years I mean you know the the the overall trend is clear you know um the markets generally go up because the money supply yeah yeah you know why did prices of houses go up 40% because the supply of money went up 40 per. you know it's not it's not I it's not really that complicated so yeah no I mean I think like as always right like time in the market often beats time the market um because it's impossible to to actually time the market for under most circumstances and I think sometimes people get lucky with it and then assume that they're like a genius and can do it again and again and again um but the reality is that the market will humble us all at some point why don't we go ahead and wrap it up there um we we'll have NFA live back I guess next week next week I think it'll be on Rob's Channel um so we'll see you guys over there next week and again if you're not subscribed uh to to Max or Rob links for their channels are in the description below and uh we will see you guys next time bye\n",
      "Summary: The video discusses the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency market. The speaker analyzes past Bitcoin halving cycles and presents two possible scenarios for the current cycle: a left-translated peak where the market tops out earlier than expected, or a more typical cycle where the market cools off after the halving and peaks later in the post-halving year. The speaker notes that Bitcoin is currently trading above the fair value range of $40-50k that he had previously predicted for the fourth halving, suggesting the market may be ahead of schedule. However, he acknowledges the difficulty of making accurate long-term price predictions. The video explores various technical indicators and market trends, including Bitcoin's relationship to the 50-week moving average, the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, and the influence of monetary policy on the crypto market. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with the speaker presenting both bullish and bearish scenarios while emphasizing the complexity of the market.In conclusion, the speaker suggests that the market's behavior after the upcoming halving will provide more clarity on whether this cycle is following a left-translated or more typical pattern, and advises viewers to closely monitor the market's developments in the coming months.\n",

      "Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the having if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom the sale will be ending just after the having so make sure you check it out and lock in the lower rate let's go ahead and jump in the Bitcoin having is probably one of the most significant events in our industry I often find people debating every cycle you know whether the having is priced in or not whether it has an effect on pric or not my view is that you know we've had three having before we had one in 2012 one in 2016 and of course one in 2020 and I I certainly do think that the having does play a role in the cycles of the crypto verse um I also think that monetary policy plays a role but I don't really fall in either Camp completely I don't think that it's only based on supply side stuff and I don't think it is only based on you know monetary policy I think it's a combination of of different things markets are complex um they're they're based on a lot of different things and so because the having is one of the most important events I wanted to do a video where we talk about it and talk about where where I have previously said that theit the price of Bitcoin may be now price predictions are honestly something that I'm not super into um because usually you know usually price predictions don't really turn out that great if if you put in a price prediction and it goes above it then you know the comments aren't so nice and if you put a price prediction and we don't quite get there you know people are also upset but I wanted to to revisit something that I said four years ago and kind of see like where are we with respect to that so four years ago I put out this video Bitcoin Fair valuation at the next tabing in 2024 I put out this video in 2020 in May of 2020 the price of Bitcoin was around $8,000 and what I said back then was that if we follow the fair value logarithmic regression trend line then by the fourth having which is the having that's about to occur the price to bitcoin would be between 40 to $50,000 okay that's what I said back then clearly we are above that price right clearly if we go back and look at the video that I put out a year ago or no this was at the end of 2022 um or mid 2022 just before the the the um the final collapse occurred I also sort of Drew it out going to around a 40 to 50K so with Bitcoin right now at 63k it's ahead right I mean there's no denying it it's ahead of where I said it was going to be back then now of course back then putting out a price prediction four years later um and and hoping that it would be accurate at all was probably something I was fairly naive about uh but here we are 4 years later and the price of Bitcoin is actually above the target range that I put and it's also above this area that I put as well going into the having and so with that in mind I I want to discuss a couple of things that that may come up after the having um that could very well uh take some people by surprise now there's a lot of different thoughts to this current cycle with it being you know so hot at this point in the cycle we've never seen the market put in new highs before the having right this is the first time ever that Bitcoin has put in new highs before the having and so that was you know probably one of the reasons why back then I I didn't think it would be quite so high but we are at new highs before the having and so I just want to talk about what you know what to potentially expect after the happing now there's two different trends of thought here one of which is a left translated Peak okay now to be completely honest I'm not really in the left translated Peak camp but it does have like maybe 40% of my attention and the reason for that is if you were to take the ROI of Bitcoin from Peak to Peak and you take it from the April Peak Peak instead of the November 2021 Peak and you compare it to last cycle it sort of looks like it potentially could form into a peak sooner rather than later in which case you would get a left translated top meaning the the the actual top occurs way before anyone thinks it will historically Bitcoin has topped out in the fourth quarter of the post having year so if you look at Major Peaks that Bitcoin has had in the past if I were to get an arrow here you can see that this top was in Q4 of the post having year this one was in Q4 of the post having year and this one was in Q4 of the posst having Year we're currently in Q2 of the having year so you know that is is still about six quarters away when Bitcoin typically tops but again so far this cycle is anything but typical with Bitcoin putting in new before the having so if it is to translate into a left translated Peak a left translated cycle then it would be more likely that the top would occur in 2024 as opposed to 2025 if we are going to follow that then I have to imagine that we would follow potentially what happened last cycle now it's not really my base cas but again it would be foolish not to at least acknowledge the similarities but on the other hand where I would say 60% of my attention is right now is what if this cycle is just like prior cycles and we are all over here jumping through hoops trying to explain why this time is different when potentially it just Peaks when it normally does and one way that we could go about getting to that point would be that if we had a cool off in the summer okay now there's no guarantee and if we follow this path then you might see the exact opposite of a summer lull but if there is a summer lull then one thing to keep in mind when you look at the last two cycles as measured Peak to Peak you can see that at this point in the cycle Bitcoin was only up or it was it was actually still about 60% down from its all-time high now I want you to think about that for a minute in both prior Cycles at this point as measured Peak to Peak Bitcoin was 60% below the all-time high 60% below it now right now Bitcoin is not 60% below the prior high in fact 60% below the prior High would put Bitcoin all the way down at around $26,000 that's how accelerated we are this cycle look at the last cycle 60% down from that Peak you can see that by May of 2020 that was when the having occurred Bitcoin was down 60% from the high and then if you go back to the cycle before that this the that the having occurred in July if I remember correctly and if you go to July of 2016 you will see that Bitcoin was approximately down 60% from the high this having it's not right it's not 60% down from the high in fact it is at the high it's at the high which has never happened before so this has caused a lot of people to view this cycle as different from the prior ones and I have to tell you they make a fair point they make make a fair point and if you measure it from the April top you can kind of see that Bitcoin is doing just about what it always does at this point in the cycle if you take the April top as the more important top and of course there is evidence to suggest that the April top is the more important top for instance some of that evidence to suggest the April top is the more important top is to look at views to a lot of different cryptocurrency YouTube channels and to note that there were more views in the first half of 2021 than there were in the second half where Bitcoin basically just put in a lower high in terms of social activity but somehow a higher high in terms of price if you look at Bitcoin with respect to its 50e moving average one of the things that it does after every major cycle top is that it goes back down to the 50 we and then gets a bounce a dead cap bounce before ultimately capitulating we saw that happen over here as well go back to the 50 we get a dead bounce and then go all the way down this past cycle we did not see that exactly what happened was we went back to the 50 we and instead of it just being a dead cap bounce to a lower high which is what potentially that would have been we ended up getting a higher high which took a lot of people off guard now I was optimistic of a higher high but honestly I think because of for for wrong reasons you know and sometimes you get things right for the wrongs reasons and and it's important to take that into consideration so we can see that that happened right we can see that we went to the 50 we we got a bounce but that time it actually led to a higher high the even the intermediate bull market in 2019 had us bouncing off the 50 week at some point and so the 50 we today is at around 40K it's at 39.2k 39.3k which is interesting because again that is way below the current prices way below current prices and I have to imagine that if we do not evolve into a left translated top if we do not right so there's two op you know there's two options right we evolve into a left translated top where the peak occurs in 2024 or we evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 if we're going to evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 you really need to see Bitcoin cool off for a while and again as measured Peak to Peak you can see just how far quote unquote ahead of schedule this cycle is it's actually not that unfamiliar when you think about it the reason it seems like this time is different is because Bitcoin is at new all-time Highs but if you look at the last cycle there was a period where it too was well above its prior cycle but what eventually happened is it bled back down and basically got in line with the prior cycle and then still ended up showing diminishing returns okay and then it actually got ahead of that cycle again this is why a lot of people thought we were going to go to 300 K last cycle but it still was diminishing returns so I want to continue to put forth this idea that if we do not evolve into a left translated Peak sometime around the having and instead the market cools off going into the summer then you might just see something like this where it causes the cycle to just get back in line with prior Cycles now that of course could make a lot of people think that the cycle that the peak is over and and the Bull Run is is is completely done and and maybe they're right right but there is at least some evidence to suggest that that could be what is ultimately in store for us as we get lat into the cycle if you're not familiar with how the last cycle worked and why we what what happened when we bled back down here there's a number of things that really put Bitcoin back into a intermediate bare Market sort of you had a a quantitative tightening bull market and then a bare Market as rate Cuts arrived and then a QE bull market that topped in 2025 now take a a look at Bitcoin this cycle and see how it's doing something very very similar in the sense that it's had this major run during High interest rates you can see it's had this run during High interest rates and in fact if you were to look very closely at when the FED paused here and compare it to this you can see something very similar happened right it it fell just after the FED paused here it fell just after the FED paused and then it went up quite a lot but ultimately what happened is that it it found a local top as just before rate Cuts arrived and then it bled for a while before getting another bull run into the post having year now by the way the having is only four four days away so if we do come up and put in a new local high before the having or maybe around the having that still doesn't necessarily invalidate the idea of the market cooling off sometime after the having if the left translated Peak is not going to occur okay so again there's two thoughts you have a left translated Peak where us Deens just can't help ourselves and everyone just front run runs everything until until the consumer caves or the other idea which would support the idea of this time not being different would just for the cycle to get back in line now if the cycle gets back in line then maybe this view from four years ago of around a you know 40 to 50K Bitcoin by the fourth having isn't that far off I know right now if we were to go back to 40 to 50 okay it would probably feel like the world's falling apart for a lot of people but one thing to consider is that when when e I'm you know I don't know how I made it this far in the video without talking about it one thing to consider last cycle is that the 30% drop Bitcoin had pretty shallow drops during this QT bull market right pretty shallow drops and then eventually it finally got a 30% drop that 30% drop corresponded precisely to the point when eth Bitcoin broke down and eth Bitcoin just broke down below the summer 2022 low so if you were to get a 30% drop sometime after the having that would actually put you kind of right around that range that we said way back over here and in addition to that it would also get you Loosely backed in line with where the prior Cycles were so going into this Bitcoin having is certainly different in the sense that we've never seen a new all-time high before the habing if you were to go look at the risk metric of Bitcoin you will see that the risk on bitcoin has never been this High going into the having in fact the last time we went into the the the 20 when we went into the 2020 having the risk of Bitcoin was at 04 when you look at the 2016 having in July of 2016 the risk on bitcoin was 0.4 today the Bitcoin risk is6 so it's actually quite a bit higher than it was during the last two 3 to4 this time we find ourselves at 639 and only a few weeks ago the risk was in the 7 to8 risk band to give you an idea of what the 04 risk band would look like which is where we were going into the last two that's where the 04 to 0.5 wristband is that's where the price of Bitcoin was at the last two Habs and you can see actually that Bitcoin when those rate Cuts arrived right here had that correction back to the 100 we moving average now what's fascinating about that is that it would correspond to the prior breakout zone so I I I feel like there's two different ways that we can look at the market here here that make the most amount of sense number one is that this is not different from the prior cycles and we're kind of on track with where we should be and that could be viewed by maybe looking at the ROI after the after the low if you look at the ROI after the low and you compare this cycle with two cycles ago this is exactly where we were but you can see that it at this point it did cool off for a while and then did get a drop kind of um you know this was day 520 or so about you know a month and a half from now or so so you can view it like that or you can view it from the peak and still say we're where we should be based on uh based on measuring it from the April top right if you take this out Peak to Peak if you measure it from the April top we're pretty much where we should be but again I can't help but think are we are we are we doing the same thing again where everyone tries to come up with a reason for why this time is different but in reality it's not so my thought process on the matter is this as we go into the Bitcoin having if Bitcoin accelerates into the having and post having and into June right if it is something like that where you know over here in 2019 in fact before rate Cuts arrived it actually did rally in until June last year we had a a local top in April but then we swept the high in June if we get something like that where Bitcoin continues to go up throughout the summer then I would be more in tune with the idea of a left translated top where you get a top in 2024 as opposed to say 2025 however on the other hand if you get a low Top by Bitcoin here as rate Cuts arrive and then instead of you know and that could still include sweeping the prior high right but if you get a look kind of like we did over here with the spot ETF we we put in a new high on the day of the spot ETF for the cycle if on the other hand we see the market cool off into the summer and go to say the 04 to 0.5 wristband or even the 0. 3 to point4 wristband and we get the market more back in line with the prior two cycles then I I think that perhaps the base case should still be that the cycle is playing out just as it always has and you still could get a top in in late 2025 and in fact it was this very intermediate bare Market that kind of scared a lot of people off in fact what happens if something like that happens again where rate Cuts arrive and you go back down scares a lot of people off and then because everyone gets scared off the FED starts printing money again and then you get a QE bow Market I've said this before and I'll say it again there's two types of bull markets in crypto there's quantitative tightening bull markets that occur during periods when the FED is lowering reducing the assets on their balance sheet that's what we got in 2019 and that's what we've got over here and during those periods during those periods eth Bitcoin goes down eth Bitcoin goes down during QT quantitative tightening bull markets how many people for the last couple of years have said that eth outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market that's not true not without any disclaimer because as you can see bitcoin's been going up since late November of 2022 and eth Bitcoin has been going down the entire time so that is why I still think there is some evidence to suggest the cycle may play out like it always does rather than a left translated top I'm not completely unsympathetic to the idea of a left translated Peak there's a lot of really smart people out there that frankly provide a compelling case for it and I could honestly provide a compelling case for it I just showed you guys some of the different charts but if Bitcoin does not run into the highest wristbands the 0. N to one wristband this summer and instead it just cools off like it did back over here after the having it might scare a lot of people off but perhaps it's just doing what it did last cycle and it the only reason that the top the local the midcycle top came later was because rate Cuts came later this cycle than they did last cycle so you have quantitative tightening bull markets where Bitcoin goes up as e Bitcoin bleeds all Bitcoin pairs bleed and then you have QE bull markets that go where Bitcoin goes up as eth Bitcoin goes up so eth outperforms Bitcoin in a QE Market but not a QT Market there's two different different types of bull markets so that is a very important distinction and I think we've only received more and more evidenced over the last year that Bitcoin really is dependent somewhat on monetary policy because last September when eth Bitcoin came back down to to this area right here there were there were a lot of people that thought that it had bottomed because that's when it had bottomed in the last cycle Q3 of the pre having year this development here which is what I said was likely going to happen this development of the the devaluation of eth against Bitcoin shows that the market is very much dependent on monetary policy whether we want to believe it or not so if that is the case right if that continues to be the case then you very well could see a a repeat of what happened over here sort of an intermediate Lull in the market followed by because of rate Cuts right that occur during rate Cuts followed by the last rate cut which leads to a QE bull market where you maybe top out when you normally do in the latter part of the post tapping year so two different theories if you're new here that's what is you know has really been discussed over the last uh year or so is this cycle different is it not I honestly think if you if you have a bias on it you're going to find the evidence that you're looking for um I I think we we'll know soon enough we we'll know soon enough if Bitcoin cools off into the summer which it very well could we we've seen gold breakout just like it did in mid 2019 we've seen eth Bitcoin break down just like it did in mid 20 M mid 2019 all Bitcoin pairs still haven't broken down yet but if it cools off into the summer then it just seems like it's the same thing as last cycle it's just that the the midcycle top was nine months later about about n nine months later if on the other hand after the having Bitcoin just accelerates to the upside once again then I will have to uh I will probably say that there's more Merit to the idea of of a left translated top but that's what I'm looking at right now and so to just revisit my prediction back in 2020 what would be the fair value of Bitcoin at the fourth having of 40 to 50k I find myself today seeing a $64,000 Bitcoin 4 days before the having and I I can't think I can't help but think to myself wow back then when I made that prediction I thought it was a lofty prediction that frankly was maybe not you know not that likely to come true because you know when Bitcoin is at 8K and and it really hadn't done anything for a couple of years I wasn't really that optimistic um of of you know exactly how accurate this prediction would be come to find out I was too conservative potentially right I was too conservative so it just goes to show how difficult these markets are to predict um four years ago price of Bitcoin was at 8K I said fourth having 40 to 50 instead we find ourselves at 64 and what's fascinating to me is that if we were at 40 to 50K I think it would you know a lot of people would think the the world's falling apart when in reality that would have been what the fair value sort of suggested it would be and that chart that chart that you see in that video is just this chart right here um these regression bands here so at the last taing we were at the fair value that's the other thing that why I said 40 to 50K back then because at every prior having Bitcoin was at the fair value so in no the fit to non-bubble data so in November 2012 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to non-bubble data in July of 2016 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to quote unquote non-bubble data in May of 2020 Bitcoin was at its fair value fit to again quote unquote non bubble data theoretically I should have updated this chart because it does I think need to get updated every cycle I haven't really done it yet if I did update it it would just shift it down very very slightly but right now according to this chart the fair value is around um 52k 52k but if you if you were to refit it based on this data over here it would actually probably put the fair value somewhere between 40 to 50K which is why I said back over here like we'll have to refit it um and and it'll be around 40 to 50K so we're above that level right now if on the other side of the having or something we see that level just know that that is is is what the um you know the regression band would have ultimately suggested for this part of the cycle so those are my thoughts going into the Bitcoin having we will see what happens uh as the having comes around it's only four days away and and we will do an update in maybe a month or so we'll see what happened you know after the having if we just contined to rally on into a left translated top or if it cools off like 2019 and and we just kind of come back down and and cool off until until the last rate cut arrives if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs

      "Summary: The video discusses the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which is expected to occur within the next few hours. The host acknowledges reaching a major milestone of 800,000 subscribers and expresses gratitude. Regarding the market outlook, the host presents two potential short-term scenarios - either Bitcoin goes straight to the 20-week simple moving average (SMA) following the halving, or it sees a bounce to the 8-week moving average before resolving to a lower low in May. The host notes that if the S&P 500 can reach its 20-week SMA, there is no reason why Bitcoin cannot do the same, as riskier assets like Ethereum and the total crypto market index have already been testing their bull market support bands. The host suggests that a period of Bitcoin consolidation and altcoin underperformance could lead to Bitcoin dominance reaching 60%. The host believes that regardless of the short-term outcome, Bitcoin is likely to test its 20-week SMA within the next 6 weeks, which could trigger a further altcoin sell-off, as alts may put in new lows even during the halving year. The overall sentiment is cautiously bearish, with the host anticipating a period of Bitcoin consolidation and altcoin underperformance in the coming months.Summary: The video presents a cautiously bearish outlook on the crypto market, with the host expecting Bitcoin to test its 20-week SMA in the next 6 weeks, potentially leading to further altcoin sell-off and Bitcoin dominance reaching 60%.\n",

      "Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin the having approaches if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe crypto.com links in the description below make sure you guys check that out we're going to end the sale after the having sometime this weekend I don't know exactly when but I would go ahead and get it now if you want the subscription at the lower rate before we jump in I I would like to say thank you to everyone who is a subscriber here I like to kind of take a step back when I hit these major milestones and just say you know I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing it means the world to be at 800,000 subscribers you know when I started the channel I had no idea that it it would grow to be this big uh but here we are and I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing to the channel and I know I don't get everything right and I I do get things wrong um but I do appre appreciate you guys sticking with me uh either way so I just wanted to to acknowledge that and to say thank you to everyone for being a subscriber also the the having is is almost here and in fact by the time you watch this video the having's probably already happened um I'll try to get the video out here uh in a in a in you know 30 minutes or so um if we take a look when it's going to occur at least from when I'm recording this video it's going to be about 5 hours um but by the time you're watching this video it's probably going to be a lot less and it could already be behind us if you go look at the um at the the how many blocks it looks like we only have about 30 blocks to go so it is coming up really really soon and I I just think it's such a big event I'm going to try to live stream it that's my goal is to try to live stream the event uh it is in about again 5 hours it's going to be a little tricky cuz that's going to sort of correspond with some uh bedtime routines for my kids uh but I will try to to to live stream it if I can uh so do look out for that here in the next four or I guess by the time you're watching this video it'll be a different time but ideally I'm going to try to get get on here live by 8:30 Eastern um is my goal but again no promises so Bitcoin is is currently at at 64k we're going to keep this pretty short um because I mean you guys know my thoughts on the market but I do just want to say you know there there's a couple of different scenarios that could play out and I'm sure you've seen me talk about him a thousand times you've probably seen everyone else talk about him a thousand times the the sort of the two main short-term things so sort of the most likely outcomes in the short term are either you go straight to the 20we SMA following the habing or you get a bounce first to go just north of the 8 week moving average and then you resolve to a a lower low in May um off of off of whatever low this is you know so those are the sort of the two most likely shortterm outcomes to me again I I don't know which one will play out I I could certainly find evidence for both I will say you know with the S&P 500 at its own bull market support ban I I really do Wonder like well if if the S&P can go to it 20we SMA why can't Bitcoin you know I mean it's been a long time and with the S&P it had been really since November since it had been at its 20we SMA and now it's there once again and I wonder like you know with Bitcoin what's to keep it from going to its own 20we SMA it hasn't seen it since really mid October so if the S&P 500 can go there why can't Bitcoin in fact it's not even just the S&P if you were to look at at eth you can see it's been wicking down to its 20we moving average already you can see the riskier assets are already hitting it um if you look at at total three you can see that it's already been wicking down to its bull market support band so as you go you know further up the risk curve it's easier for those assets to hit that 20we SMA because when Bitcoin sneezes the the the altcoin market gets annihilated and you can see that I mean Bitcoin is still well above its 20we moving average in fact I mean in fact for it to go to its 20we SMA it would require about another 15 % drop from the current prices the problem with that for things like eth and and alts is that if Bitcoin were to do that then they likely go below their bull market support bands and this is exactly what we saw in 2019 right we saw eth go below its bull market support band after that local top just after eth Bitcoin broke down before Bitcoin did so that when Bitcoin bounced off of its 20we ese in the short term even didn't hold it as support eventually it bounced off of it ethusd basically just held resistance at the bull market support band so I I do think there there's some some reason to think it could play out like that you know as much as there there very well could be sort of a relief into late April early May um just keep an eye on on the 20we SME because you know the hard part with it is that you know you can look at at at prior local tops right you can look at things like 2021 and and 2019 and see that they had these rallies back up to the 8-week moving average on their first weekly close below the 8we moving average right so the first weekly close below the 8we right here in 2019 we rallied right back above the 8we and then formed a lower high in 2021 right same type of thing right go below the 8 we and then rally on back up the thing is is like we could see a weekly close below the 8we but we haven't necessarily even seen it yet also note that in 2019 after you had that rally back above the 8we it was after a 34% drop you know at this time Bitcoin has really only dropped about the same amount that it has been about 20% right I mean you know as much as it might feel like it's it's been more brutal this time that's only because the altcoin market is getting hammered but that's what alts do best in you know when Bitcoin sneezes alts get annihilated so you can see that so far this is a pretty standard drop for Bitcoin right 20% nothing too different from what we've seen um but do note that while it is 20% the the rally back to the 8we SMA in 2019 occurred after it had gone down you know closer to 30% which would actually get you near that 20we moving average so it's really hard to say and and while it is convenient of course to compare to 2019 and early 21 because you know I'm sure everyone would like that rally back up to the8 week SMA there's also other examples uh like like 20 late 2021 where you get something like this where you you know you're putting in these weekly closes where the Wicks are lower right you can see that right the Wicks are lower there as well just like they were over here um but you ended up just getting a capitulation down right so there's no guarantee right there's no guarantee with the market and I think like I I think honestly we're not going to you know next week will be sort of the decision point on on if you're going to bounce off of it or not um this week I imagine it's not going to you know we're not going to fully know I mean this you know it's already Friday anyways but yeah I I think it's just I mean it's certainly interesting because you're not only looking at at Bitcoin sort of slowly fading back in uh but you can see that a lot of other markets are as well right like the S&P is down to its bull market support band eth is down to its bull market support band or at least it has been wicking there it's not there at the current moment but it has been for the last couple of days off and on and then you have some altcoins that are below their 20we SMA already right I mean um I'm sure a lot of them are right I don't know if link is yeah link is Ada is Litecoin is not surprisingly madic is um dot is I mean a lot of them are already below their Market sport band so you can see that like the stronger assets are still above it Bitcoin is still above it right now but you know I I look at these other markets you know even the Russell the Russell is below it right so this is a great example of how the S&P is at the 20 we but the Russell is below it so you could see something happen very very similar in crypto where Bitcoin goes to its 20 we and when it does if and when it does then maybe alts go below it right that could could very well play out sometime after the having whether you get a rally to the 8we SMA or not right and again I don't know um if we're going to go to the 8 week ese next week or if it's going to be like you know a month later I could easily come up with a reason for either scenario easily easily it it's going to depend on what your bias is um so I I really I really can confidently say I don't know which one's going to play out but I will say that regardless of whether you get a relief to the 8we or not my expectation is that Bitcoin will go to the 20we moving average within the next few weeks right you know within probably either this month or next month is my guess I mean it's been a long time right I mean it seems like we're due for it in 2019 you know it it took about 25 weeks you know something like that in you know 2020 or so all the way through 2021 we fell back into it in in May in fact and that was about 32 weeks we're currently at what 26 weeks right so my guess is you know sometime in the next 6 weeks we're going to find ourselves at the bull market support band and then we'll see what's up again my guess is that if if Bitcoin sort of chops around in this range for a few months that's what should send the Bitcoin dominance to 60% right so if it goes down to the 20e Ese and then it bounces back up for a little bit to the 8we ese or vice versa goes to the a week first and then goes to the 20 week it's that chopping process that should break the altcoin market down and I mean you can see it already happening you know with eth Bitcoin which is something we've been following you know for a long time you know it's now at 0482 now it is you know talking about this sort of stuff on the the sort of the cusp of a major Bitcoin event you know there could be counter Trend rallies for this stuff but again you know my guess is that eth Bitcoin is is just sort of doing something like this after breaking down where it it sort of TR to hold on for a week but inevitably it keeps on bleeding into into the summer months where maybe it finally can potentially bottom so that is my view here going into into the having remember if there is a larger drop in the crypto verse uh following the having whether it's immediately after or whether it's delayed by a few weeks one thing to remember right one thing that I I I think you should remember is that when you measure things from the peak and you go Peak to Peak Bitcoin is ahead of schedule by a lot right it really is it can afford to give back a lot of that and still be in line with prior Cycles we've said that forever this is why I've said Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio because it's going to outperform the altcoin marketing till QE Returns the problem for alts you know I'll tell you the problem for alts is that if Bitcoin just drops back down here to get back in line with the prior Cycles just like last cycle it dropped back in line to get to get back in line with its prior cycle if Bitcoin drops here to get back in line with the last two cycles guess what alts can go back down to their lows or they can put in new lows because they're not that far off of their lows to begin with whereas Bitcoin is right you know Bitcoin is already well off its low whereas the alts a lot of them are not now some of them are but a lot of most of them are not really that far off of their low so I mean you know if you see a situation where Bitcoin just simply goes back to where it you know where it was in the last two cycles at this point that's how the altcoin market can put in you know a lot of alts can put in new lows even in the having year and we saw that happen last cycle as well and and I know there's always going to be some type of reason for it or justification or rationalization but that is just what I've seen you know cycle after cycle after cycle is that alts can get that bounce in the prehab year but inevitably as you get later on in the business cycle and we get you know as the Market is really starting to digest all those rate hikes and and the FED refusing to Pivot sufficiently that's where alts you know the order books are thin and that's where they just continue to slowly bleed uh not only on their USD pairs but also their Bitcoin Pairs and then my guess is that once you start getting multiple weekly closes by Bitcoin below its 20we moving average I think there's a good chance that at that point Bitcoin dominance has topped but between now and then I think that you're going to see it you're going to see Bitcoin USD sort of chop around in this range for a couple of months um and during that time I I think the Bitcoin dominance will go uh to 60% as eth Bitcoin goes to 003 to 04 and and all Bitcoin pairs go all the way back down from 0 42 to where they currently are down to about .25 best case scenario and that's if you want to say that they're oscillators right so back down to 0.25 or so so that is is really my view right now on the market um there are also sort of other views that you could look at that sort of revolve around if it wants to follow some of the prior you know the prior Trends with some major geopolitical events we did see Bitcoin over here you know put in some scary Wicks back in early 2022 um and then they still swept the local high after that so there is always a chance that something like that happens as well um so be ready for anything uh but I I do think that the market would greatly benefit from a a summer lull where it just kind of gets boring for a little while and all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out that's what I think would be the best case for the cryptoverse is a a summer where all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out because no one cares anymore you know all the hype is behind us and then then you start to see them find their true lows on their Bitcoin pairs you know for everyone who is who's laughed at the idea of the devaluation of all Bitcoin pairs they just put in a new low last week right they just put in a new new low last week so don't laugh at it I mean this is just what happened last cycle you know it's just exactly what happened and and if they do come back down here like over here then I I think there's no debating anymore that it it really is following sort of what 2019 was it's just that the reason why it was delayed until the having year was because rate Cuts occur potentially now in the having year as opposed to the preh having year like last cycle so to me it all looks like it's playing out in a very similar manner where all Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows just before rate Cuts arrive the onset of rate Cuts potentially as early as this summer should allow a Bitcoin pairs to bottom out and then a USD pairs can find whatever low they're going to find um based on how how low Bitcoin goes and then perhaps by the last rate cut uh then you start to see it go the other way the biggest Counterpoint to all these views is if it's a um you know if we just get some manic blowoff top or something this summer uh following some type of left translated cycle I mean you could have a left translated cycle where the top is is March right I mean that's what happened in the dot crash right I mean that the top was in March of the election year that's not really my base case though um but I I would say I would say that if you are to get a left translated cycle where Bitcoin just goes parabolic into all the um into all the bad news and everything then you know then that would sort of invalidate the views that I'm expressing um my base case though is that we are just simply repeating what we saw uh back over here and all Bitcoin pairs should come down as we get into this summer and and by you know maybe by June July something like that I I could see all Bitcoin pairs finally bottoming out not withstanding Maybe some future Bitcoin parabolic rally which we saw over here but that is is you know really my view on the market right now and we will see if it if it continues to pan out or not in the meantime bitcoin's at 64k um and we'll see if it if it goes to the 20we estimate in the next couple of weeks or if instead it first rallies back up to just above or just around its 8we moving average um uh first but either way I do think we are due for a test of the bullmark sport band here in the next you know month month and a half if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the crypts premium at intothe crypto.com we have tons of charts thousands of different charts for a lot of different cryptocurrencies if there's a lot of cryptocurrencies that you have that you

website a website with thousands of charts for altcoins right so I I'm not I just I I'm I I put my maxi hat on when Bitcoin dominance is in a macro uptrend and I I don't really think you should blame me for that um but do check it out links in the description below that sale will end uh this weekend after the having so make sure you lock in the low rate between now and then and I will see you guys

      "Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to provide an update on the early havinge price action pattern that we previously outlined if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptoverse spot ETF we said that we will likely get a pullback about mid January and then after the spot ETF occurred and we were back over here you know at around 42k one of the things we noted in this video over here where we talked about the early having year pattern is that what tends to happen is you get a dip early on in the having year so take a look at 2024 and then compare it to 2020 um and 2016 and 2012 right so in all cases in all prior cases for Bitcoin sometime in q1 there was a correction that took Bitcoin anywhere from between 15 to you know 30% below the yearly open right so the yearly open for Bitcoin this year is 42 or sorry 42,2 79 so from 42279 a 15% drop puts you at around 36k okay now remember there's no guarantee it's going to play out like prior Cycles I'm just simply pointing out historical draw Downs at this phase of the cycle right and again in 2016 looks like the Max draw down was about 16% in 2012 it looks like Max draw down was about 16 177% as well so far from the yearly open at this point Bitcoin has dropped about 8 and a half% 8 to %. right so it has been a a you know somewhat of a substantial drop and you know it's easy to look at a drop like this and come to all sorts of conclusions but I think it's also important to you know to try to stay as true to the Chart as we can and say well look at this point this correction has not evolved into anything more than what we've already seen it doesn't mean that it can't but if you were to look at the pullback in February of 2023 going into March was about a 22% drop and then this drop here right was about a 21% drop this drop here was also about a 21% drop and coincidentally enough this drop so far has been about a 21% drop so while it certainly has felt like a large pullback right I mean 48 49k all the way down to 39K it is still it's still within the realm realm of what we have seen over the last year um so if it were to fall to the 20we SMA or the bull marks wor been it would actually have to fall further than it has fallen during these other three prior Corrections the one way that both could be true where we go to the bullmark SW band but Bitcoin doesn't fall too much further would be if it just takes a while and you know the 20we SMA just sort of slowly curls up here right and then you know bitcoin price action just sort of Fades into that something like that could happen in fact that has what has been happening for bitcoin price action in a lot of these prior Corrections is that it kind of slowly faded back to it and like here's an example where it was still above it and we got to pop back up and then it still faded back down a few weeks later and we had a long Wick down same thing over here right it got close didn't make it to the bullmark squ band and then it popped back up only then a few weeks later only then drop back down again right so those sorts of patterns could of course repeat themselves you know you could go to the 20we SMA but it doesn't mean that you have to immediately drop to it um if it were to play out like these prior patterns and looking at say like the short-term risk that we were talking about in the last video it's a slow process down right where the where the extension from the 20we SMA just sort of slowly goes back down to where we get back to that bull market support band right so you know we are getting relatively close um again just to reiterate while I talk about the short-term stuff I do not think it makes sense to try to time the market in this way uh you know for me as I've said before I buy when the risk is low the risk metric's low and then I I take profits when the risk levels are high um but I I don't try to time each individual move based on on this sort of Outlook one other thing that we could look at is that 50-day moving average we covered that a little bit as well so the 50-day SMA uh for Bitcoin we have fallen below it about about 10% you can see that prior drops below the 50-day SMA were closer to that one was about 14% this one was about 14% And then this one right here was about 14% so if it were if Bitcoin were to drop 14% below the 50-day SMA from where it you know sort of crossed down a 14% drop actually puts it at around 37k you know we we've mentioned a lot that sort of those High the high 30k range is going to be where you know if the Bulls are going to hold the line that's where they're going to want to do it in this high 30k range um and so here we are right we're in the high 30k range we'll see if that happens the other thing of course to just to remain aware of is the the 100 we estimate right or sorry yeah this is the the 100 we moving average so this is sort of like a a different scenario where if the Market support ban doesn't hold like 2019 right if it if it doesn't hold then the 100 we ese is I think what you would look towards next so the 100 we ese is currently around 28k which coincidentally is is sort of slowly starting to go back up to where the prior breakout Zone was right slow slowly starting to go back up so if it plays out like this and we get a drop below the bullmark support band sometime in the next couple of months then I think you would be looking towards that that 100 we moving average um as as sort of the next level that that could theoretically hold as support there's other ways that we can look at the market as well there's the uh the fear the fear and greed Index this has been putting in um you can see that it has been putting in higher lows and higher highs for a while so the current fear and greed index reading is at 48 so this one might be a one to keep an eye on the prior low was all the way down at 30 right all the way down at at 30 so a pretty big drop that we got back in September so um we'll see if this one can can do that same thing again if it if it puts in a lower low then that could be a sort of a sign that the trend is changing but otherwise I would look to see if it if it continues the pattern so this is sort of just you know I just wanted to provide an update on on this early year having pattern where Bitcoin does get this pullback and and it's actually sorry it's actually happened several times in fact and in fact in in both of the last two cycles when it had this pullback again this is just a fact right it's not a this is not a this is what Ben thinks this is just a fact in both of the last two cycles when Bitcoin had a pullback in q1 we tested both the bullmark sport band and the 100 we moving average right so it happened right here and then in the last cycle it happened right here but in both cases when we held support one we didn't in both cases both of those were eventually Tagged so we're getting kind of close right and I don't want to give you the impression that there's a guarantee that we even drop to the 20we ese you know the market can surprise and you know I mean it's always possible that it it it gets a pot back up and and then leaves everyone second guessing themselves for another two months um so that's why I say I would just I would come up with a strategy stick to it whether it's based on risk levels or something else stick to it and um go forward like that as far as altcoins go because I I I see people ask me about altcoins in the comments a lot as far as altcoins go they're always as always they're going to be dependent on bitcoin if Bitcoin bounces then it would likely raise the altcoin market up if Bitcoin drops then the altcoin market will get wrecked even harder so for instance to get back to the bullmark sport band for Bitcoin to get back to say the 21 week EMA it's only about a 5% drop whereas for the altcoin market to get back to that level 21 we EMA it's about a 7 to8 8% drop right so you can see how the altcoin market is is more volatile as the as these moves play out and that's one of the reasons why we see the Bitcoin dominance just kind of slowly keep grinding up because as Bitcoin falls back into the bull market support band that's exactly what happens is alts fall a bit harder if you think back to earlier in 2023 there was a period over here where Bitcoin was falling back into the bull market support band and if you were to Overlay Bitcoin dominance onto the chart you can see the dominance was starting to go up before we got that bounce right before that bounce occurred and so whether we get a bounce or not it seems likely that dominance would continue to go up as this move continues right and even in this move over here there were some weeks where Bitcoin popped back up I mean like it it got pretty close to the 20we SMA and then it got a a 5% weekly candle right a 5% weekly candle from the current price would put Bitcoin back at you know 42k or so so just trying to give people you know the perspective here on the market and to say look I mean I I I know that it it certainly seems like this has been a large pullback but at this point it's actually been a pretty standard pullback and when you look at the year-to date Roi of this year compared to 2016 it's actually pretty closely still following it right now again if if a Black Swan event were to occur if if the economy were to slow down then yes we could deviate from this stuff that that's exactly what happened in 2020 right I mean we we deviated from it and we had a much larger drop but I'm just trying to show you that every single cycle early on in the having year we've had a drop in q1 that took us you know between 15 to 30% below the yearly open this cycle that would correspond you know to hitting the high 30k range which is where we've been uh even going a bit lower would still be within the realm of historical Norms this reaction is going to be a very important reaction okay because if it bounces which is what it you know you can see there's examples over here where it gets to the 20we estimate and then bounces if it bounces then the dominance of Bitcoin should absolutely soar and if that is the case then I imagine ether Bitcoin would would likely take a hit so again probably going it's probably going to stay relatively boring for a little bit longer you know in terms of thinking about a mid January correction the the whole idea was that it would take at least a few weeks if not a couple of months um and and so far we're we're sort of in our third week of the correction some of these Corrections over here took a lot longer right so I could still drag on for another you know three to four weeks easily and not be out of the realm of of what we've historically seen so you know I I think that these markets are are are exhausting for everyone draining for everyone um there's certainly a lot of different views on on how things are going to play out but again all I can stress is that it's important to have a plan and stick to it no matter what and if we do get a larger drop then these three right if we get a larger drop where either it goes to the to this level here or the 100 week or even lower you need to have a plan in place so you know how to navigate that right you don't want to be the person that goes into it not having a plan and then you end up capitulating something only then regret it a few months later so make sure you have a plan stick to it we've outlined likely outcomes hopefully it's useful to you guys thank you for tuning in make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and I'll see you guys next time bye\n",

      "Hi, this is NFA live this should be a relatively exciting show for two reasons first of all we have the Bitcoin having coming up in just about a day and we also have a new guest with us today Max from because Bitcoin uh how you doing great thanks so much for having me Ben yeah and you started you started doing this a year or two ago is that right yeah probably about 18 months ago officially yep all right yeah so max is um I've known him basically since probably before he even started the YouTube channel or right around the time that he started it uh so make sure you guys go subscribe to him and Rob as well uh links to that are in the description below so make sure you guys check that out and we're just going to go through a lot of the different questions that I think would probably be on people's minds as we go into the having uh so let's just go ahead and jump in Rob we'll start with you on this one the having is tomorrow it's tomorrow we've been waiting forever here it is fourth having um and I'm guessing it's going to garnish some attention should be making some headlines different places I'm curious what what effects do you think the having will have on the larger crypto space um do you think it'll bring new eyes to the scene or are we still kind of just uh you know the same old same old people just kind of hanging out um do you think it'll it'll actually bring new new people to the space uh we saw a lot of new people come to the space last cycle sometime after the having um or do you think it'll be quiet for a while and do you see any narrative shifts after the Havoc that's a pretty loaded question first of all I would just like to say that Max has a great background I'm sure he got to the same place I did which is fivr and uh hopefully he didn't get ripped off but it looks great and uh I gotta tell you one of these days max we're gonna have to put that into an nft just me and you so yeah yes that is my old green screen but I'll be jumping in that green screen as soon as the uh as the Bitcoin hits 100K But to answer Ben's question which I think is is what uh everybody wants to really try to figure out is this Bitcoin having and I know like there's a lot of first of all that I still believe in the fouryear cycle some people say that it doesn't really register I still and some people will talk like Bob Lucas will say well it's just left translated and we're going to see a big blowoff top in 2024 which could very well happen but I still think that the narrative around it and there's still a lot of people say well there's Mass adoption coming and it's already here I still think it's I mean I don't think that we're at the same level like we should be and what we could be in like 2028 or 2032 or you know time comes up but Ben if you get to show my my screen real quick because everyone wants to know like well the Bitcoin having and you did a great I I watched your your video Ben about uh uh the ethereum evaluation ethereum ethereum valuation of Bitcoin about how you know Bitcoin dominance is going up and how it's wreaking havoc and it's true it is right now I know people will will also talk about you know like hey well you know these things happen leading up to the having but if we take a look back this is from Smart Valor it's a good website and if we take a look they did all the work for him which is great this is how Bitcoin behav in the year leading up to each having because we had one of course in 2012 2016 then 2020 and I know people will say well there's always a dip there's always this massive dip before the having and there could be I mean we saw one pretty massive one in 2020 but of course there's a reason for that and and we could either say like it's because of the of the almighty Corona virus or it was something else but yeah there was a dip in 2016 but again just take a look at this so with having with the having one in 2012 the year leading up to the having it went up to 385 per. and the year after of course because we always see alltime highs the year after so far it went up 5,000% having two in 2016 leading up to it 142% now there's dips along the way and we're seeing that right now but then a year after that in 2017 2 84% in 2020 even though there was a turbulent year like we talked about it was still up 17% for the year getting into that having in May I think it was May 12 2020 and then it went up almost five almost 600% the year after that and we can see here that that yeah same thing happened the year leading up to to the having on November 208th 2012 this is what Bitcoin was 250 and then of course we come up and then you can see right here that yes there is a a drop before that and then it comes up and there's a drop before but it's like the same thing as like a bull market so we're seeing the same thing kind of Replay I know it's a funny thing because like Ben you'll say like uh you say hey I I I told you that the Bitcoin ethereum evaluation was going to start to start to lose momentum or actually bleed away to ethereum and then people were going to blame a Black Swan event and they never would have saw it coming but here we are and again same thing happens here 2015 a year going into it yes it's not a straight line but we kind of I mean really rallied into it there's you know dips along the way but I mean it's going in that right direction and then of course 2019 to 2020 we started at 7325 we had it kind of flat and then we saw the almighty Corona virus right here but then we rallied into it so I still feel like the same thing's gonna Happ happen that's just how I see things and I'm I'm feeling pretty good about this having so far but the big question is and and we we'll talk about this later is what's the macro is there going to be quantitative easing or more quantitative Tiding are they actually going to cut rates are we going to have the liquidity that we absolutely need which we had beforehand even though we're in quantitative uh tightening right now I mean we still rallied pretty well but can we get that liquidity back in the market and that's I think that's the big question on top of the fact of are we going to see World War II so yeah that's where I got yeah it's interesting because you know at some point you would think we would need to make the shift from quantitative tightening to quantity to quantitative easing but what needs to trigger that shift is the is the is the thing that I I think we're kind of wrestling with um someone asked where a guy was I I should have mentioned that he's he's in Dubai and I mean there's obviously a lot of stuff going on right there going on right now there with the conference and um everything so he wasn't able to make it this week um so um Max I I'll put the same question to you I mean like what are your thoughts here on the Bitcoin having um is this just kind of the same old thing that we've seen before and everyone's trying to over complicate it uh do you see any kind of shifts coming after after the having what are your thoughts yeah I I would agree with the with the last part I think that a majority of people and it's very easy to do this I I tend to do it all the time is to sort of chronically over complicate something that has for over a decade now been a pretty reliable uh we'll just we'll call it a risk on event and in the simplest of terms all you need to do is you know pull up your trading view chart and Mark out every single Bitcoin having right you need at this point you know you need to draw four vertical lines whenever a Bitcoin having has occurred look at the the price action that has basically come almost immediately following so um you know I I try to look at this thing from Every Which angle you know I look at it from the side I look at it up side down I you know I try to include the macro and and fed policy in all of my decisionmaking but um you know the truth of the matter is this is a very unique time to be in the markets right Bitcoin is now on the global stage in my opinion for the first time um there is you know new on-ramps into crypto you know specifically being these you know nine ETFs um and it is you know there's more regulatory Clarity the accounting standards have shift did in a positive light and are working to you know become more friendly for corporations and big money to actually onboard into this digital commodity if they choose to do so um but again like Rob had mentioned and Ben like you commented on there also are some macro headwinds which can only be ignored for so long unfortunately I am of the belief that we do still have some time I believe we're maybe on borrowed time some people probably don't like to hear that but but I do believe that there is this this unique pocket of time where it's all coming together and we can really see risk perform um positively of course I don't have to tell you guys this and I probably don't have to tell the audience this but historically during a Fed pause until something has quote unquote kind of broken and we see Unemployment uh you know trending above 4% and the FED actually has to step in and begin easing through you know interest rate cuts and other measures um we can actually see risk you know being stocks and now crypto performed tremendously well and you know going back to you know to the last cycle you know we actually kind of went through a little mini fed cycle here and you know 2018 2019 and 2020 um you know where Bitcoin actually the floor kind of gave out we dropped to about 3K and then we had that famous rally into June of 2019 when we topped um you know there was actually hikes going into that and then of course right as Bitcoin basically topped in June of 2019 the FED began to actually cut rates um more or less right after that and it did dramatically affect Bitcoin some will say you know it was a reflexivity and you know we had to you know we we sprung hard off of that local floor so you know of course the market corrects to the downside some will say it's covid some will say it was in the charts the whole time some will say it's not I don't know you know nobody knows whether it would have happened with Co or or without um but again I don't think that this time really is that much different I think that every cycle has some distinct differences from from a previous one I mean for example last cycle we had a double top we haven't had a true double top before we have had a cycle like the 2013 one where we had you know two pronounced Peaks but a true double top had never happened before and additionally in the bare Market we had never spent as much time below the 200 WEA as we just did coming out of this most recent bear so there are you know of course Very recognizable and notable differences of every cycle but you to answer the question Point Blank I don't think that this time is much different and I I'm trying my best to not overthink it um and say you know what there is no reason for the FED to intervene at this point we're trending in that direction and we are on borrowed time there is a Day of Reckoning coming but I do believe at the earliest it's probably sometime in Q4 we have the having you know in less than two days and I do believe that there's plenty of room for risk to run in the short to Middle term maybe going out six months okay yeah no I mean it's great to get you guys opinions um and the market has been on an absolute tear I mean essentially after since October right I mean it was pretty boring summer last year but then since October uh the market has basically just been up only up until the last few weeks but um you know the next thing I'd like to talk about is of course Rob's absolutely favorite topic and it's of course Bitcoin dominance um and you know I you know you guys know My Views but I always like to get other other views because you know I'm I it's it's a good idea not to live in an echo chamber so Bitcoin dominance has once again broken a new highs I I we saw 57% actually it came really really quickly really quickly you know that that move to 57% it's kind of cooled off back you know it's back down to like the 55 like 55 and a half or so so it has cooled off quite a bit since that rally up to 57% uh so uh Max I'll start with you first on this one do you think it's going to keep going up after the having um you know it was it it was going up into the spot ETF and then it kind of waned a little bit following the spot ETF but then it just kind of picked right back up so what do you think is gonna happen this time and and this kind of goes to the whole like the last question as well like will there be a narrative shift and what people are focused on will they will they start focusing on more things besides you know sticking with Bitcoin um do you see you know what are your thoughts on that Max well first I have to give you a compliment Ben because you were one of the few people that with a big following publicly called Bitcoin dominance rallying to this point I didn't expect it to get up to I think it topped at what 57 recently or wherever did you you deserve a lot of credit for that well I'm known for riding Trends too long see well we'll see right nobody knows besides the market right like you know we we all have our our inclinations but uh you deserve a lot of credit because I remember months and months AG I don't it was probably six months ago plus we did a space together or you came on on my my channel because Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance was significantly lower and eth BTC was significantly higher and much has changed since then so kudos to you where do I think it goes from here so I think that Bitcoin dominance is in the process of we'll call it distribution okay I believe believe that the meat of the move is over um but that does not preclude it from going a little bit higher than here maybe maybe 60% that's not my base case but you know let's let's look left on the chart and you know use that to you know maybe forecast what could happen next so ignoring the you know whether this is a left translated cycle or an expedited cycle let's look at it contextually for where Bitcoin is at um you know from from a a p perspective right so Bitcoin actually has gone on to get above the previous cycle all-time high of 69k so most comparably again ignoring everything else but just pure levels on the chart pure you know where was the cycle High where was the cycle low you could probably compare Bitcoin right now to like December of 2020 okay if we just ignore everything else and say okay Bitcoin in December of 2020 went on to sweep the previous cycle all-time high of 197 it paused there for what maybe a month or or something like that it was chopping around altcoins got destroyed during that time right Bitcoin uncertainty like you always preach Ben uh when Bitcoin is uncertain alts get absolutely eviscerated and we are seeing that once again right so um again comparing this period of time to December of 2020 there is turbulence under the previous cycle all-time high which is not uncommon we saw that again last cycle and then also two cycles ago it seems to be sort of the same thing happening again what did we see in December of 2020 well what we saw was Bitcoin dominance basically put in a deviation or bull trap High where on when Bitcoin finally decided it was time to push through with conviction above the previous cycle all-time high of 197 you saw Bitcoin dominance put in an explosive move which ultimately ended up being sort of a bull trap you know for for the Bitcoin Maxis um so I I think it's possible we are seeing that Devi that deviation high right now only time will tell um I do have hedges in place you know like I'm I'm holding some Bitcoin l2s like STX and some Bitcoin ordinals and things like that that I think would be beneficiaries of you know Bitcoin dominance continued rally maybe above 60% um but of course you know I I really I am of the belief that contextually with Bitcoin chopping under the previous cycle all-time high seeing similar signs of Bitcoin dominance putting in you know this this last explosive push I do believe that over the next six months or so it would probably makes sense to see Bitcoin dominance Trend down dramatically and additionally and and I don't mean to you know bring this up because I don't know if this is on the agenda today exactly I imagine that that would translate to eth BTC finding a bottom sooner rather than later but that doesn't again preclude it from going down a little bit more and only time will tell yeah no I mean it's great and I mean I I I think it's always worthwhile to hear these other views because um you know no one really knows right I mean you know no one really knows and you know one thing that I've wrestled with a lot before and I've seen other people do this too is like you know just because someone gets something right doesn't mean they're going to be right they're going to keep being right right and also just because someone gets something wrong doesn't mean they're GNA be keep being wrong I mean you know markets change no one knows what's going to happen and I I I could see eth Bitcoin carving out a bottom this summer um that's kind of my base case I could see that actually happening so we'll see if that happens Rob what are your thoughts I mean I know you're you're more of a you're more of a Bitcoin Maxi yourself right Bitcoin dominance to 100% I yes exactly go ahead Ben what was your question I'm just kidding I'm just kidding what what are your thoughts here on on on dominance do you think it's uh you think we're getting pretty close to the uh to the top well first of all let me just say that I I I was like listening to to Max especially on like the Twitter spaces and things like that he's very smooth in his delivery and very smart and and what he talks about so I gotta tell you it's good to hear like different sets of opinions it's great to have a Max here so to talk about I mean Bitcoin dominance I got to tell you like when you were talking the 60% I'm like yeah you know I can kind of see it you know I was I was I was under the assumption like well you know it always kind of comes back that way right something happens there's something that happens in the market a Black Swan event or you know something that's just that kind of has disruption and then people get scared and they're they're like okay I'm risk on but not that risk on to go into like you know Pepe coin I'm gonna go into the safest asset in the most volatile industry which would be Bitcoin and I I could see that for sure but then like there's a narrative that that people are always talking about especially in in in the crypto space being the Bitcoin maxos are going to say Bitcoin only right but there are narratives that are out there one of those is dpin Right centralized physical infrastructure Network the other one are dexes because we see what's going on with the centralized exchanges getting sued getting their pants sued off by the SEC and then leaving of course so we have to have dexes and then of course there's another big one which is web 3 so we talk about that but there's one that I feel is on an undertone and Max alluded to it when he was talking about it when he talked about runes and he talked about ordinals and he talked about things like stacks and l2s and I think what's gonna really push Bitcoin dominance up I know Ben loves this part too is uh the the l2s or even l1s that are going to be built on bitcoin Ben if you just throw this this chart up I always talk about this website it's l2. watch so imagine this and I and and and even like Adam back has talked about this how he's talked about he hates the fact that everybody's building off of Bitcoin people should just build on bitcoin because he says it's like it's it's like the tcpip layer for for the internet so why can't they just build on the most the safest most secured Network or computerized Network ever built in the entire world and he was right so when I take a look at these these l2s that are coming out and they're all new so you I to understand like this some most of these are trash let's just let's just call it SP Spade but like when we talk about things that are coming out that are actually doing pretty good like a Stax who's been around for quite some time I can really see things actually happening for sure and then like I just dropped a a video on my second Channel where I talked about core core is a top uh 50 well it's 56 now but it's essentially an L1 L2 type of uh uh token which is built right on top of Bitcoin using delegated proof of work and delegated proof of stake together to actually make dexes nfts and a whole host of things you can only do with smart contracts so when I see stuff like this happening I'm like why can't we take away the nonsense that's going on over in ethereum world and they're massive gas fees like just like with with core and stacks right now if you use it or the things that are being built on top of it they're just going through their Satoshi initiative it's super cheap and it's super fast so for me to see that Bitcoin dominance could go up why couldn't it especially with the different institutions that are here and how they've been drilled into it now they can say oh there's something else I can do and also smart I see it could actually go above 60% but again I'm not always right no I mean I I've it's possible it's certainly possible um I think the answer is going to probably come in the next few weeks because you know there's two prior examples where we had these kind of these like closes below the 8we ese 2021 and 2019 and in 2021 after it happened Bitcoin got a rally eth Bitcoin went up but in 2019 when Bitcoin got that rally eth Bitcoin went down so I think if we see Bitcoin get some type of relief I don't know maybe sometime after the having into may I I don't know exactly when it would be but whenever that comes whatever happens to eth bitcoin should be very telling about where we are in the cycle so I I'm going to be focused a lot on that um over the next few weeks but we will see um next question Rob I'm GNA start with you on this one to rotate and you know I remember last year you saying something like this um and and you ended up being correct it was basically you know sell and man go away um like I mean no one's D Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear since October I mean you know I mean it was basically like 25 to 30k not even that long ago um and I I think sometimes we forget just how quickly it has moved so I'm curious like do you think it's going to be similar to last summer where we just get the market gets boring before maybe moving up again like later in the year or something you think it's just going to get boring for a few months um do you think or on the other hand do you think everyone's gonna get think it's boring and then we just get another you know face what's it called like a face melting Rally or something that's exactly face yeah I mean like so so what are your thoughts going into the summer because I mean again I know last summer you you thought it was going to be boring do you think it's going to be boring again this summer or you think it's going to be different Matt well first of all I I hope so I I really do because everybody who's in the chat right now answer a question for me uh tell me if you think that you've accumulated enough where you're like you know what I've bought plenty of Bitcoin and I just cannot handle any more bags I just I don't want to buy anymore especially if it goes down and gets cheaper just let me know in the comment section because it seems like when these types of things Ben when you say things are boring this is great because this is when people who like the dollar cost average is fantastic or if you're Dynamic DCA is things go down which I think where we at the risk levels now 0.6 0.59 somewhere around there a little yeah I think a little above 0 six so like if we're in this place we're like well I mean for me this is a good time to just accumulate a little bit but as we start to like if it goes sideways well great I have more time to bring things in but then if you if you want to talk about selling May and go away there's this great chart on this website that I steal from constantly and if you just take a look because it's it's yeah it's a nice website it's very nice I think there's a sale going on until like tomorrow and then it goes away so but if if you say sell in May and go away it it actually works out pretty well I mean historically speaking but then if you really want to break it down because people say but Rob you don't get it because this is the having year so it's all it doesn't really it count well if you take a look at it I mean if you sold at the end of May of 2020 I mean you had a 30% increase on January a couple of drops there 34 and 10% and then you're down here and you just kind of stay away until October and then you buy in and then October rallies November rallies and December rallies that's not bad I mean I'll take that year right and if we go back to 2016 I mean it's the same type of thing if I want to sell in May okay well June's gonna go up but I have red red I take I stay away September as well and I I buy back in October November December I'm doing pretty good so I still think it can work out all right the thing that you have to understand though and one more thing is is this there's a presidential election I think this is going to be pretty tumultuous as we get into it so there was this piece from hbk's wealth and it talked about the presidential election years versus the non-election as far as returns and this is just taking a look at the S&P 500 you can see that in the presidential election years which this is that year it sends to like kind of peek off around March April and then just kind of fall away until we get into junisha may go away October is here you buy back in and then we have a nice little rally of course drop here and then off we go but 10% for that year is not too bad now does that mean that I'm going to sell everything no no I'm just telling you these are just the data points that we can say take a look at me personally I'm just here to accumulate and uh get into some early round type of cryptos that could either make a lot of money or go to zero one of those two will always happen yeah I was looking at this um this is uh this is the S&P 500 in 2024 compared to the average of all election years right I mean so you can see like it has come down a lot recently but it also went up a lot too like way more than it does on average so there's just been a lot more volatility this cycle than I think we've seen in a lot of Prior Cycles um but yeah I I thought that was interesting and that chart sort of reminded me of that uh Max what are your thoughts here I mean I know earlier you said you expected uh risk to do pretty well um over the next six months but you know even with that do you think that the market could cool off before that phase or do you think it's not going to really get much of a breather or do you think the Breather is almost over yeah that's it's a it's a great question of course we're all from relatively familiar with the uh maybe cliche but overused but also kind of accurate saying of sell and may go away um one thing that I've been preaching for a while going back to I mean even I would say Q4 of last year is that I was seeing signs early on of a maybe expedited cycle for crypto um and it's probably off of of you know the back of this this fed paw and there isn't quite as much in my opinion economic deterioration as a lot had thought myself included and we're in this you know kind of Goldilocks window where risk can rally really unencumbered um you know so so do I think that selling may go away will come to fruition I I would think that worst case in my opinion from what I'm seeing right now and again of course subject to change it's just one man on the internet's opinion I think that similarly to how this cycle for crypto is being a little bit front Rand and we've actually seen for the first time a Bitcoin all-time high before a having which of course had never happened before um I also think it's possible that selling may go away is being front ran a little bit and we're seeing that right now with this April correction so similarly to Rob I am not I am not in the camp of you know drisking or selling spot because again like I mentioned in you know during our first question here if you just draw four vertical lines on your trading View and Mark out every Bitcoin having look what typically happens in the six to nine months following Additionally you know for a lot of us that have been slowly you know and thoroughly meticulously dcing into our digital digital assets and our unregistered Securities over the past year you know a lot of us have tax consequences for selling right now and I'm I'm not really interested in incurring any uh you know tax consequences trying to reposition because May perhaps is a little bit choppy so in my opinion you know and again going back you know the past 18 months for Bitcoin we haven't seen more than a 22% correction on bitcoin so from our local high recently take it down 22 to 25% maybe you get 57 56 worst case that's not enough for me to incur you know a taxable event to try to reposition so uh maybe it happens maybe it doesn't but for me ultimately it doesn't make a big difference because the having is in a couple days um and typically what happens after a having is months and months of prosperity and hopefully price discovery yeah no it's a fair point I mean I think like all the corrections that we've had by Bitcoin for the entire bull market have only been about 20 to 22% yeah we've already seen it go down about what 18% or so um so that I think that'll be the the area I mean if we get down there see if it turns around and if it does maybe the time's not different you know but yeah what do you think Ben do you think selling May and go away will come to ahead um I think now I mean so I so we went into the 7 to point8 risb in March so that I think was the time to to drisk some kind of like during the spot ETF um at this point it's kind of like when we went back to 39K after the spot ETF um we then it was it was a 22% drop and then we just rallied after it right and and so I was like you know this could be our preh having year dip and then the rally just continued and so now it's kind of the same thing it's like you know the the area to do it if you were convinced about it would have been in in March you know um when gold broke out because that's actually in 2019 when Bitcoin topped was when gold broke out um so I think that would have been the time to do it now I do think there is a risk of if you've waited if you've waited till this point and now bitcoin's down 20% we did see both in after the 20209 or the 2019 top and the 2021 top the first weekly close bow of the 8we SMA we then had a rally back up you know to the we right which is around 67k we actually went slightly above it in both cases so I think what what's more important is not exactly what happens here at the range lows but it's what happens whenever we get a relief move does it sustain or does it just put in a lower high I think that is kind of the thing to look for because back in after the spot ETF it wasn't a lower high we just you know had another face ripping rally fire um the the reason why I am more cautious on this one than than the last one is because eth Bitcoin has now broken down and gold is broken out which both of those events marked the 2019 local top and it wasn't the market cycle top and this kind of goes back to what Rob was saying you know there is this idea of a left translated peak in 2024 and I can sort of like I'm like 30% maybe 40% aware of that like you know thinking hey this is this could actually happen you know if if we were to Rally into the summer to higher prices without cooling off then I would be very more so convinced of a left translated Peak but what if what if if you think about what happened after the 2019 top after gold broke out and after e Bitcoin broke down Bitcoin went into a six to n month bare Market in fact now imagine you get that after the having and everyone thinks the cycle is over by the end of 2024 because it just hasn't done anything since the having and then we just get another move in 2025 and then the cycle Peaks when it always does and once again everyone over complicated it you know like there is a chance that that that happens um so I would I think I would just watch to see what happens whenever we get any type of relief does it form into a lower high or does it lead to a higher high and then you probably have your answer to whether it's a left translit cycle or not at that point I can see absolutely yeah and again even in 2019 it was it was just a local top we bled for a while we actually bled back to the 100 we SMA um and then and then we started to go back back up and then we had the we had the pandemic crash but if you ignore that it was just sort of a bleed after all Bitcoin pairs broke down and then and then once we got that back you know we start to go back up those are my and and by the way I mean you've always said this going back when you know before I started my business and I was watching all of your videos you know years ago Ben you used to always say something kind of along the lines of you know the longer it takes you know the higher will ultimately go something along those lines and you know I think a uh this idea of a prolonged sort of midcycle Correction freaks a lot of people out because everybody wants to be rich overnight myself included right of course i' I'd love for us to just go straight up in a straight line and I hope that we do but ultimately I don't think it would be a death sentence for Bitcoin to kind of reestablish value between 55 and 75k for even a full quarter um you know I think ultimately would probably lead to more constructive uh price action to the upside in the long run but people you know their patients will be tested no question yeah yeah I mean I think the the the thing to look for in the cycle I think is is the Bitcoin dominance I I really do think it's the key for the cryptoverse and I think I think that dominance will Top before Bitcoin Falls below the 20we SMA that's my guess is that it's going to top before Bitcoin Falls below it and I think between now and then Bitcoin gets occasional rallies that just take off Bitcoin pairs even lower is my guess um so that's why I just say like you know if you want exposure to crypto Bitcoin I mean you know Bitcoin is is a relatively safe bet if you want to take on more risk there's obviously the altcoin market there's the full DJ mcoin Market um but you have to be careful with those and I I I think the winning strategy with the altcoin market and and even if you are in the riskier memec coin stuff is just to remember like in five years that Meme coin is probably not going to exist No One's Gonna care about it because they're going to be worried about the next stage of mean points right so the way the way to navigate it is it's okay to have exposure to various parts if you want to take more risk but just occasionally convert it back to bitcoin if you make a lot of money right because at least you know you then know hey Bitcoin is still going to be around in 10 years I don't know if this random meme coin is Ben how could you say that how dare you my a meme coins oh my I think I've converted most of my audience to bitcoin Maxis at this point but I will say by the time I convince the last person to be a Bitcoin Maxi that's when the dominance tops out and we go back the other way I don't think we're that far away I think maybe this summer dominance tops out we'll see though but you are correct like what anybody out there like if we're being completely honest Would You Bet Your Life that Your Meme coin or your altcoin is going to be around in 50 years would You Bet Your Life on it I probably would not would I bet my life I mean it's an extreme example right would I bet my life or something valuable that Bitcoin will be around bet your would you bet all your money on it or something right that's much more friendly right so and I would for Bitcoin I have a high degree of confidence and that's why your strategy ultimately it's conservative you know relative to a lot of other people that you know talk about crypto publicly but it is ultimately a long-term winning strategy and people need to recognize that profits from altcoins ultimately do have to flow back into Bitcoin that is the sustainable strategy for sure yeah I mean I think Rob I think Rob was talking about this what last week on NFA live we were talking about like what do you do when you get an airdrop and I think what was your strategy like just 50% you take profits on it right away 50% back to bitcoin or USD and then you let there oh no no it was you let let it go up 2X or something or if it goes up 2x then you sell 50% was that what you said yeah I I call it well two things I call it the half and half method so you get into meme coins or something crazy and then let's say you put it you know 100 bucks in and then it goes $200 so then you sell half immediately and you put the other hundred bucks let it ride because that's house money then when it doubles or triples or or quadruples then you take half again or you take two or three or 4X what do you want to do and then you let the ride and you do that until there's no more riding and it just goes away and then you're like well okay I I did 8X but it went to zero so I don't feel so bad because a lot of people just let it go all the way up and all the way down but if you just play with house money there's a reason why like like I I can see people in the in the chats going well this sucks because you know now we're gonna sideways and you know this isn't what I want to be there's a reason why all three of us are pretty much just like on all of our videos on all of our Twitter spaces we're pretty much the same person whether it goes massively up or way way down me's a little bit of excitement but it's because we der risked enough to like well if this happens then we do this if this happens we do that and I think that's where people should would want to be as opposed to just going okay I sold my kidney I hope this memec coin goes up it's one of those things have a plan no matter what and then enjoy your life don't stress about it right I mean have a plan like you know if Bitcoin goes to 50K or even lower so what have a plan if it goes up have a plan I mean it I I think you know I used to navigate crypto without without thinking about like what do I do if this happens I only would navigate it based on one particular outcome I never hedge myself but once I started hedging My Views then it makes things easier you know you're like all right well this is what I think but if I'm wrong I don't want to be you know completely left out of whatever that next trend is um and when I when I get air drops um well I don't I don't really get air drops anymore because I'm not really that active in in the space but when I did when I used to get air drops my strategy was immediately convert half of it to bitcoin at least half to bitcoin and then let whatever else ride because like half the time they would just go to zero anyways um so at least you get some of that value out in inss um why don't we goe and move on because we do have two more questions and then I'd also like to get to audience questions at the end if you post your question now I probably won't see it so maybe wait like 10 minutes and then post it um this is an interesting question and I to be completely honest most people aren't going to care but gold is is one of these things where like it doesn't do anything for like 10 years you know and like if you think about this entire bitcoin's like like it's entire history essentially since 2009 gold has essentially gone nowhere in that in that entire phase but we just saw gold break to new all-time highs and it seems to be a somewhat explosive rally so I'm curious about what your thoughts are on gold um I I often think that people who like gold are are more alike to people who like Bitcoin than they would care to admit I think the main difference is the generation that we are right so if I were born one or two generations ago I probably would have been really into gold you know but because I'm born into more of the digital age I'm more into Bitcoin so I think we're more alike than different um so I'm curious like what your thoughts are on gold here it is now 2300 2400 um max where do you you know do you think that uh this is going to continue I me Silver is also not too far behind it in its own move um and I guess the other question is like why do you think gold is rallying so that's probably the bigger question is is why do you think it's rallying rather than like what do you think it's going to go to sure yeah the gold strength is um pronounced it's very impressive um and and I would say I mean why do people buy gold historically right it's sound money it was sound money before Bitcoin it was a store of value when you know our our parents generation was nervous about the state of the world they would you know convert their into gold and uh you know a lot of it is more of a um it's a mental thing it's a it's a mental insulation it's not like if your country was invaded you're going to put you know 500 pounds of gold on your back and somehow travel to another country right but it's a it's a peace of mind thing you know and you know again historically it is you know a sound currency uh there is a scarcity aspect to it there's a lot of commonality and overlap between gold and Bitcoin and I think everything you mentioned Ben is correct um I would say that my bias on gold um really stems more on my perspective and my my forecast on where I think dxy is headed and similarly where I think Bitcoin is headed I've already shared my opinion on where I think Bitcoin is going we have the Bitcoin having just around the corner um I expect Bitcoin to you Trend upwards aggressively over the next six to nine months subsequently I do believe that dxy is forming a sort of distribute you know a distribution here I do anticipate dxy topping very soon and again if you just overlay gold with dxy on a weekly chart you can see that there is a pretty prominent negative correlation between dxy and gold so I don't think we're I'm not of the opinion that we're going to see a decoupling where there's suddenly a a prolonged period of a positive correlation where gold rallies and dxy rallies I think that one of them is lying so either gold is lying or dxy is lying I think that gold is leading and going to see dxy of course sort of reclaim that negative correlation and begin to take a dive over the next quarter so um I do expect gold to continue upwards and I think it's probably off the back of the you know dxy weakening okay yeah fair enough um it has it has been really strong you know and I I can't help but look at it I'm like wow you have like a 10-year base I the bigger the base the more explosive the rally and for I mean for I know like all the crypto you know Deens are like you know it's up what like 10% or something and like people are like you know like 10% is like a minute candle on a meme coin right but for gold you know for an asset that's that high market cap like that is a big move in a really short period of time and so like that's why it it it means something Rob what are your thoughts here um are you are you are you watching this gold move I'm not watch I mean but I own it I own gold and silver and I I think and I don't I never UND and we talk about this many times I never understood why the old maximalists and this and the precious metal maximalists hate Bitcoin so much because like you said we're trying to all do the same thing we're trying to get out of the Matrix which is relying on paper Fiat and it just seems like I there's there's that one gold bug guy that is what we all talk about for some god- awful reason but in reality I think for the majority of people that are into precious metals I think they can see the value behind it and of of of Bitcoin itself and like I I like I never understood with this guy like why don't we have a debate between that guy and like Mike Maloney Mike Maloney is huge into gold he's put out a great series on precious medals and he's he likes Bitcoin as well so like when I take a look at this I I think you know why why not own why not old gold why not diversify like you know uh we've got I diversify not just in the crypto but the stocks precious metals and and real estate and I think everybody should do the you know kind of do the same thing but to talk about why gold went up so much let me I I don't know but how did gold do in 2022 was there any kind of rally during that time I mean it it it it still mostly stayed below the high I don't really think it did that well um it's only recently really started to show strength I mean I can I can pull it up and see but 2022 was kind of split it rallied in the first half of the year and then didn't really do too much and actually corrected a little bit looks like yeah I mean it looks like it topped in March of 2022 and then basically just went down yeah till November and then it rallied again into December kind of there there's a theory going around about why Gold's rallying so much it's because the Nations that are going to war they are trying they're fearful of us sanctions so how do how do you get away get around those sanctions well you stockpile Alternatives and one of those would be of course gold so people are talking about how Iran could be could have stockpiled after the Damascus situation and the and the bombing and the reason why I ask about 2022 is because for the Ukraine Invasion I think was February 2022 and the same type of thing was being said about Russia stockpiling gold at the same time so I can see I can kind of see that that valuation I don't know why they don't just use Bitcoin it's a heck of a lot easier to transfer and zip around value but that's where we're at yeah I always like I always think those posts by the gold bugs are so disingenuous because I mean like I I own both like I own Bitcoin and gold but like if you go to trading View and you look at the Bitcoin or you look at the Gold valuation against Bitcoin it's down so much since Bitcoin launched that it rounds it to negative 100% like like that's how far the valuation of gold has fallen against Bitcoin since Bitcoin has been around so again like it's not it's just look I mean the the Bitcoin valuation as far exceeded gold for a long time um I mean my guess is over the next 20 years Bitcoin will still outperform gold you know maybe in the short term gold could outperform uh Bitcoin but and I I mean I guess it has been since March right ever since gold broke out Gold's been doing better than even the S&P 500 even the NASDAQ um it's been having my view is that I I I think that gold is breaking out because it senses that um rate cuts are coming sooner than the market is potentially thinking and so that's kind of why I think I I think it's sort of sniffing something out just like it did in 2019 and and um but we'll see I mean you know we'll see if it if it plays out in the same way last question and I mean I you know this is more so geared towards Max um because I mean Rob is I mean you know you've been around here forever we' probably even asked this question you before yeah but I mean if you want to take it if you want to answer you can Max Max yeah so since you're new here um why did you start your YouTube channel I mean like what what was your motivation what are you helping to accomplish with it uh what brings you here well Ben you you actually played a big role in in bringing me here I was a very early follower of yours actually before you even had your website I bought your Google sheet way back in the day and I'm still locked into my original price thank you very much because I got in early pays to get in early um you know I I learned a lot from you in the very beginning and I went through last cycle and you know Ben and and Rob also this you know this is a compliment to both of you guys amongst a sea of grifters and thieves and people looking to prey on unsuspecting retail you know guys like yourselves you you conducted yourselves in a manner that you know I mean I can't even imagine how many millions of dollars you guys turn down from shill deals and you know crap like that and you know I I wanted to in the beginning play my you know play my part in that I felt as though I had opinions that you know um I could share something to offer I have you know I have an ability to lead I have you know an ability to organize a team um and I wanted to play my my part my equal share in the sort of collective hive mind of you know CT and and YouTube and help educate that's sort of the underpinning of of what I'm doing is I like to teach I like to collaborate and you know making money certainly feels nice right but there's a certain there's a certain sense of fulfillment that I personally get out of somebody messaging me saying hey because of what you said it made a difference in my life and something clicked for me and that feels really good and you know I I started because Bitcoin and it was it's a small Channel still um we're growing quickly certainly which of course if you go to Ben's beautiful website and you overlay social media growth with uh you know the price of Bitcoin you can see why I'm starting to grow quicker it's it's I'm doing the same thing I was doing all bare Market it's just suddenly more people care about crypto so um you know I am a i a result of good times and I pray that they continue on because of course it's you know a nice Tailwind for for my young business but yeah I mean really to answer the question Point Blank I love to teach I love to to collaborate and I love to debate you know like I have a differing opinion than you know you guys for some things and there's some overlap but that's what makes a market beautiful is that you can think one thing I can think another and we can come together and just talk about it politely and nobody knows what's going to happen right like we can't I have my hunch I have conviction just like you guys do but Bitcoin dominance could go to 90% And you know even over flip it and put that on on Twitter don't do that don't do that or or it could literally nuke down to 10% we could have like the crypto equivalent of the NASDAQ bubble between 1995 and 2000 where altcoins bubble like people you know can't imagine everybody's thrown money at altcoins speculating anything that's crypto and then 99 out of 100 of them don't exist in a couple years you know so who who knows what's going to happen but yeah I love to to collaborate and teach and debate and uh generally it's it's just a passion of mine how many subscribers are you guys at now like 13 14k or something yes on YouTube somewhere in between there yeah well there's 3,600 people watching so if everyone here goes and clicks the link in the description below and goes over to Max's Channel and subscribes then uh I I'm sure he would appreciate that and I think he deserves that he's been they've been putting out they it's not just Max by the way I mean it's a team of people um so go check that out you guys do like daily live streams right we Yeah we actually have a show coming up at uh 10:00 a.m. eastern time we do a Daily Show we've got a panel of Five Guys we're all just Traders wrap this one up then if you got it coming up in 10 minutes that's okay I got a big team they got it all right well before we before we end it here I I did want to take at least a couple of questions um and one of the questions I saw was um what is the best way to learn about crypto and to do your own research so I mean I don't know if they're talking about like from a fundamental perspective but I if someone were getting into crypto like like what do you guys use to do your research and I mean and maybe talk about like all the different tool or some at least some of the bigger tools that you guys have been using especially for all the different things that are happening in the cryptoverse there seems like there's a thousand different narratives that you could you know that you could follow and whoever wants to take that one is fine go ahead Max yeah um I would start on uh one of our three channels I think that's a really good place not to not to spew the obvious but um I would say I would say learn to do very basic ta right and understand Cycles like there's some very awesome free indicators out there like I mean you can even just look at like you know Ben has a a you he's kind of coined a very famous one he's combined a 20 week SMA and a 21 we EMA which has been sort of uh marketed as the bull market band for good reason right so you can determine when you know Bitcoin is trending upwards High time frame or trending down by just a simple you moving average band there's also things like the P Cycle top which I think people should keep an eye on which is again a free trading view indicator someone someone made it it's also on Ben's website there's also some some good onchain stuff like you know Bitcoin terminal price hoddle waves things like that I would as a beginner I would stay off the hourly time frame like literally just go daily time frame and above um and whenever you see Bitcoin down you know 50% from its its all-time high that's time to start paying attention to maybe consider entering the market but you know learn very very basic ta and and some of the more popular onchain indicators can really help you just DCA at the right time you know but stay off of the hourly time frames mainly the py cycle top just to give credit is uh was developed by Philip Swift um a while back and I the the idea was to predict the top with within 3 days and it did a really great job of doing that in the first uh the first 2021 Peak um and it actually happened I remember it happening and like no one really believed it you know um but I think it was retrofit right it was fit after yeah it was created in 2019 it was created in 2019 okay but it did it did get the first top in 2021 I feel like a lot of these like metrics that everyone created in 2019 uh it they called the first top but then most of them like didn't really call the second top because it was just sort of like a it was like a dead cat bounce that just somehow made it to New highs you know yeah um so yeah that was kind of an interesting one um Rob did you have anything to add just yeah just one thing Max makes all great points the thing I would say is that if you really knew you really really knew you have to understand that it's not how much you make it's how much you keep and the big thing is that you have to watch out for scams and things to watch out for and if you're gonna get into like hot storage wallets stuff like that there's a there's a video in the in the link of in the description of all my videos and it says you know things you the the big mistakes in crypto and it has like 20,000 views and of course it's the most important video I probably have ever put out because that's what people get screwed out and they get scammed out and if they watch that video they wouldn't happen to them another video I did when I'm gonna sell on my crypto has over 100,000 views so it just goes to show you like where the priorities are the priorities are make money but really the priority should be keep money someone's asking a um this the Market's not pricing it in right now but I did see like last night there's been a couple of times here where like there's at least some in investors like thinking about a rate hike um that is not like my base case at all like I think they're done I I think five and a half percent is the terminal rate for this cycle they might go higher next cycle uh but I I think five and a half percent at the top I'm not going to ask you if you think they're gonna hike again because I don't really think any of us think they're going to um if you do think that let me know but I guess my main question is what do you think would happen if they did hike again um because that be I mean that would talk about markets not pricing it in right I mean like I guess the the implication would be like if if the economy just accelerates into you know again and and there's not a cool down and we just keep on moving up uh what would a rate what would another rate hike do well what was real quick what was what is what has Jerome Powell said about fighting inflation do they say that they're on the right track or do they say like there's it's more more stubborn what he they've kind of like the progress has slowed a lot and I I think they've kind of specul that it it might influence their the number of rate Cuts this year because previously they had said three rate Cuts this year and I'm I'm wondering if they're starting to walk I mean now the market is pricing in only two rate cuts through April of 2025 so I my view is that you know I thought higher for longer but now that everyone else believes it I think I think it's going to go back the other way because once the market fully prices in no rate Cuts that's when people give up and you need to start having some rate cuts um but yeah I don't know I mean pal Po's basically said the same thing he said for the last three years if you know they're they're going to keep rates higher for longer until inflation's durably going back to 2% yeah I I think that 3% is is the new 2% truthfully I I I appreciate their narrative and their consistency and and how they haven't wavered on that and I think it's a great goal um but it seems like three is kind of a magnet actually a little above three um like you mentioned they are currently pricing in now it looks like you know our first 25 basis point cut on the uh September 18th meeting and then through April 2025 and and these percentages change all the time right uh you know we'll see what happens um you know potentially taking us down 50 basis points off of where we're currently at um let me answer your question what would happen if we got another 25 basis point hike because you know inflation decides it's going to rear its ugly head again and and start trending up above you know headline four 5% God forbid it's over I mean like we are going to absolutely nuke if we get another rate I'm gonna be as as clear as I can be if we get another rate hike markets are going to capitulate like that will be awful horrible for risk like sell all of your assets honestly like if that happens I'm not joking I think it'd be terrible I don't know if you guys agree with me but that would be horrible for markets but I don't think that's going to happen to be clear I think you could have the same thing happen if they just refuse to cut soon enough too because like it it you know like a tightening cycle is not just raising rates but it's also keeping rates too high for too long and the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and eight would have been in March um so we've already gone nine I think there's still you know there's still a window where talks about a soft Landing right it's so hard to thread that needle to a soft Landing because you have to stay high enough to make sure inflation doesn't come back in a second wave because if you don't and you get an inflation a secondary wave like the 70s you get a hard Landing but if you stay high for too long like let's say they stay at five and a half percent for another six months then you start to run the risk of of a deflationary crash right so that's why everyone sort of rolls their eyes about a soft Landing is because it's so difficult to thread that needle and I don't I do not envy their job I I do not envy their job because it's not and and they're also operating with long and variable lags like how can they know all the effects of prior monetary policy um so yeah it's it's a tough place for them to be and and we are oh sorry Rob go ahead no no go ahead Max I was going to say you know we are seeing some smaller economies in my opinion forecasting when our rate cuts are coming like we have seen the Czech Republic actually start to cut we've seen Poland cut um so it you know historically it's not perfect right but you are starting to see some of these smaller countries actually they they LED through the hik so they began to hike first they paused first and they've actually started to cut so I I do anticipate that you know in similar fashion to what has happened historically we will see the US begin to I guess cut rates hopefully uh later this year um but I do agree with you Ben like if they held rates where they're currently at through you know all of 2024 that would also put some pressure um on our economy and our markets but with that said like I don't know what you you guys think but I mean really the the final you know real dagger or Domino to fall is going to be of course unemployment creeping up above four four and a half percent do you guys think that if they just held rates where they're currently at all through 2024 um but we didn't see the labor market really deteriorate could financial markets hold up in that instance I mean if if the labor market doesn't deteriorate sure I just think that um I mean it seems like the unemployment rate is trending up um and the the problem with with that is that it doesn't tend to move in a linear fashion right it it goes slow and then it starts to accelerate at some point and we haven't reached the acceleration phase right so there's still a chance that we can avoid it but the longer they wait the the the riskier that's going to be I think I think there's a higher probability of a rate cut this summer than the market is giving credit for I don't think it has to happen this summer but I think the right thing to do is to cut at least 25 basis points uh this summer 50 basis points something like that just uh provide something you know are you thinking in the June meeting or July meeting I mean look last cycle I know that that the altcoin market was a lens into the consumer and I know that that when alts broke down against Bitcoin and when eth broke down against Bitcoin the FED basically cut one month later um and we we have seen eth fall against Bitcoin it had a weekly close below the June low we saw madic Bitcoin uh crash below it's June 2022 low we've seen adaa Bitcoin and Dot bit coin we've seen Litecoin Bitcoin and a Bitcoin I mean so many of these altcoins are are falling off their Bitcoin support levels and you can see it with the Bitcoin dominance so I think that the pricing out of all these rate Cuts is going to cause them to get priced in because the FED does not base their decisions on what our altcoins are doing right un they don't care what I what I what I find unfortunate is that a lot of the small like companies like Mom and Pop shops a lot of them are going out of business business right now because you know rates are going up and and and times are getting harder like inflation is so high so people just can't afford as much and but the FED has to do it because all of us Deens in the in the space can't help ourselves from bidding up jpegs you know and and and leading inflation uh to to where it was so I think that it's it's kind of a tough spot to be and the FED has to stay long enough to kind of break the animal spirits but if they do it too long then you then then you run the other issue of of a deflationary um unwind and that's not really fun either I know like people are like oh I'd love to go to the store and not spend as much money but if you if prices go down that's probably not good for risk assets terrible just yeah so everybody everybody who's watching the videos remember this when when you think like okay the Bitcoin Market or the crypto Market has to do this thing it has to do this thing because it's it's been the cycle that's always done this doesn't actually work like what we just talked about just how fragile the markets actually are and just to think how things have to really go in line before you realize that oh maybe I should have taken some profits when there was uh everything was overheated just it's just something to think about because I hate people who roundtrip and uh they really should again take some profits when everything gets too hot and and one thing just to mention about rate cuts and I mean you guys probably know this rate Cuts inherently are not bearish right it's it's the underpinning as to why they are cutting rates and you know if you actually on a granular level you go and you overlay the effective federal funds rate with you know the NASDAQ or S&P 500 markets actually tend to rally for like 30 to 60 days give or take following the First Rate cut until they wake up and they realize oh crap there's economic deterioration under the surface which is why they're cutting rates and then we see these major Corrections so I think whether the first 25 basis point comes in June or the end of July meeting or I guess hopefully September um that's probably your 30 to 60-day warning truthfully whenever it comes and I don't know when it will and what about no go ahead I was going to say you're right I mean like the rate Cuts inherently are are are bullish for risk assets if they're cutting for the right reasons in 2019 while Bitcoin topped out when rate Cuts arrived the S&P 500 kept going up and you know because the mark like the the economy was not in a recession right it wasn't going into a recession they were sort of like preliminary rate Cuts You could argue that Bitcoin is more tied to financial markets today traditional markets today than it was back then because of the spot ETF so maybe it would track the S&P 500 a bit closer than it did last cycle once rate Cuts arrive but the issue is why the FED is cutting are they cutting because they're trying to get ahead of something bad that's coming or are they cutting as a reactionary thing because they just saw a really bad labor market prance and that is is when they're not bullish like that's when rate cuts are be so it all depends on Max is right it all depends on why they're cutting and and I think that it's also risky to I I I do believe that there's just as much risk to the UPS side truthfully where you know assuming that they're going to cut because there is severe economic deterioration can also be you know a very harmful strategy long term because like you mentioned the first batch of rate cuts that we saw in 2019 um you know the S&P 500 rallied out of those cuts like 15% and then of course we had our Co nuke in March which took us below you know where that that first uh cut occurred right but you know again it's like you have to be very careful you kind of threading your own needle per se because just because they're cutting doesn't mean sell everything right because they could cut you know the labor market could be more resilient than anybody's expecting the S&P 500 could go up 50% over the next year and then something bad happens and you get a correction but that correction doesn't take you down to as low as the point in which the first cut happens so you just have to be a little bit careful truthfully you know you have to really understand why they're cutting and and it's a tough thing to do it's very tough I me with the S&P you know there there's been all sorts of like crises throughout all the decades but if you just pull up a chart over a 100 years I mean you know the the the overall trend is clear you know um the markets generally go up because the money supply yeah yeah you know why did prices of houses go up 40% because the supply of money went up 40 per. you know it's not it's not I it's not really that complicated so yeah no I mean I think like as always right like time in the market often beats time the market um because it's impossible to to actually time the market for under most circumstances and I think sometimes people get lucky with it and then assume that they're like a genius and can do it again and again and again um but the reality is that the market will humble us all at some point why don't we go ahead and wrap it up there um we we'll have NFA live back I guess next week next week I think it'll be on Rob's Channel um so we'll see you guys over there next week and again if you're not subscribed uh to to Max or Rob links for their channels are in the description below and uh we will see you guys next time bye\n",

      "Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing returns in the having year if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse tocom the having year is always an interesting year for Bitcoin there does tend to be more volatility in the having year than in the pre having year and I just want to go through historically what has happened keeping in mind that what has historically happened does not have to be what plays out this time but it is something that I I just wanted to show the first thing we can look at are the prior three having years so 2012 2016 and 2020 and what you'll notice is that in all prior having years there was a dip sometime with within the first 3 months now the dip that occurred in 2020 was obviously the most aggressive and I know that it shows it only going down here to about 30% down but we actually know it it went much further than that when you include the Wicks okay um but from the yearly open anyways but in all three cases in all three cases you can see that after about a 100 days okay so after about 3 months we were essentially still at the yearly open so go look at what bitcoin's yearly open is right now so it's it's around 42k around 42k so what would be interesting is that what this what this chart here is suggesting is that on average right if you look at all prior having years on average after about 3 months the price of Bitcoin is still at the yearly open right but also what you'll notice we talked about this going into the having year is that you get a dip sometime in the first few months of the having year and and in all three cases it went down at least at least 15% or so from from the yearly open right so if we look closer you can see that in 2016 we went all the way down to about 16% down off the yearly open same thing in 2012 maybe about 17% down 2020 it went about 30% down it actually went further than that if you include the Wicks so to give you an idea of what that would mean remember the yearly open is  around 42.3k so 42.3k um if we were to take a price range here so 15% drop gets you to around the the 36k level the reason why 36k is interesting is because that's right around where the bull market sport band is right so that's that would be about a 15% drop from the yearly open uh 2020 we know let me look at it on on a smaller time scale here so we can look a little bit closer so the yearly open remember was around 42.3 so a 15% drop gets you basically to that bull Mark sport band right that's where I would put it a 30% drop which is what happened in 2020 uh not including the wick would actually get you back down to around 29k which coincidentally is is actually right around where that that 100 we SMA is right that 100 we moving average is right around that level and the reason we've you know sort of pointed both of those potential targets out is that in at least in the last couple of Cycles you know not only have we gone back and tested the 100 we SMA around January February of the having year you can see that we also tested the 100 we estimate right so here they corresponded to the same value here they didn't but we ended up testing both of them right the bull Mark SP band and the 100 we SMA over here in 2012 you can see that we tested the bull market support ban in February but we had just tested the 100 week in December right so it was slightly accelerated tested the 100 week in December and then tested the bull market support band in in q1 but in all prior cases right in all prior cases sometime you know around this time of the cycle Bitcoin was testing you know either the bull market support band or the 100 we moving average now there's no guarantee that this happens this time right I mean I have to be clear I these these sorts of you know I don't really want to call call them predictions because I'm not really trying to predict here I'm just saying hey this is what's historically happened but these sort of forecasts they sometimes pan out and then sometimes they don't right so you're saying could go up down or sideways yes yes basically that's what I'm saying the point is that there is a risk in the market that around this time of the cycle uh we get a a you know we get these dips right and we're actually in one right now I mean if you look at at where we are right now so this is 2012 2016 2020 here's 2024 right I mean you can see that 2024 at least at the current time is most closely following what happened in in 2016 right so look at this at the current time it looks the closest to 2016 than the others and structurally there's a lot of other similarities right as well and and so and and when you when you're if you're curious about what I'm talking about it's basically like in terms of looking at um you know like this structure here finally breaking out of it right so you have these highs here you finally break out and then you back test so then again you sort of these you you come up to a level and then you eventually break out and then you you sort of back test the breakout point it looks you know more similar to that right where you have these levels that you finally break out of and so then the question right is is will it will it eventually test this there's you know we we've talked about the having actually before as well um you know on more than on more than one occasion um here here was a video this is kind of an interesting video that I I did back in in 2022 this was when Bitcoin was like 30k and we basically suggested hey it's probably going to go down uh go to the regression ban spend some time down here and then eventually break out to the upside now it's hard to see exactly what price that that is but there's another video that I put out uh and this is just sort of um an interesting video that I I got the path completely wrong on right completely wrong on but this this video was was put out three years ago so we this video was put out right around the third having and the idea was when I put this video out I I made it Bitcoin Fair valuation at the next having in 2024 but you can see that I put this video out at in at the 2020 having and I said that in the fourth having the fair value right the quote unquote fair value will be 40 to 50K which again I mean at the time it seemed absurd and you can see that the path I drew out did not play out at all right I mean we went up but this this major Peak over here actually got shifted here right it was actually here and we also did not go as high but regardless of of that the funny thing is that we're still um right around that level right between 40 to 50K at the fourth having okay so going back to this chart right now we are at 41.5k history shows that basically through the first three to four months of the having Year let me just take an average let's take the average of all of all election years right so that's the having year and then we will just show that one and then the current year so history shows that on average after four months bitcoin's price is still where it was at the yearly open in the having year after the first four months so if that is true right if four months from now or let's say three months from now because we're already mostly through January let's say if 3 months from now Bitcoin is still between you know let's say sorry let's say 3 months from now Bitcoin is at its yearly open its yearly open is of course 42.3k 42.3k puts Bitcoin still between 40 to 50K meaning this prediction of 40 to 50K by the fourth having that was made four years ago will will actually be true now there are caveats to all this by the way one of the interesting things and I I I I like to I tie this in because I think it's actually really really important The Ether Bitcoin pair remember what we said uh in the last video we said that the next window for ether Bitcoin to break down is likely no sooner than March right no sooner than March now this is where you know if it breaks down in February um that would certainly lead to to nice a nice Price look guys my view is that it breaks down I don't really care when it does it right I I mean if it does it tomorrow then great you know that that's fine with me but what I am saying is that often times when you get these breaks up by Ether Bitcoin it takes at least a couple of months for it to come back down right and and and break the low right at least a couple of months and here it took you know you can see that it came back down in May and then again in June here it came back down in in October but what's interesting and and again we we've sort of looked at this in the through the lens of of rate Cuts right and noting that ether Bitcoin broke down here during rate cuts it didn't know we weren't getting rate Cuts over here but we were right here and so there's another way to think about this not through the lens of rate Cuts but just through the lens of of seasonality right when could Bitcoin make another move if it's going to right well his shows that it wouldn't occur until sometime out you know in April or May I'm not saying that it can't go up I mean even in the having year uh even in the last having year Bitcoin went up but the next more durable move didn't occur until sometime you know around April or May so it's possible that that corresponds to Ether breaking down against Bitcoin right a few months from now remember it's often it's not always Bitcoin rallies that breaks ether down but a lot of times it is right it's it's a it's a Bitcoin rally that breaks The Ether Bitcoin pair down there are times where ether Bitcoin goes down while Bitcoin is going down here's a great example of ether Bitcoin capitulating during a time where where Bitcoin was going down but the point is that you know both of these prior breakdowns here was when Bitcoin was was in fact going up this one here was was actually you know when it actually broke down in July it was on on on a slightly lower high but the the lower high was compared to the the higher high was just occurred you know just before it so you have to think that if money does Flow Away from eth and back to bitcoin sometime in April or May that could cause ether to break down against Bitcoin and again on average that's where you know that's where Bitcoin would start to um you know potentially come out of of of a de now I know what a lot of people are thinking right I mean this is great and all but you know will it will it continue to follow that for the entire year I don't know I mean I don't I you know I think there's even if you look at at at 2020 I mean it was we had a great start to the year and then what happened was we had you know a Black Swan event and then Bitcoin just absolutely crashed and it and it retested these prior lows more or less you know we also had a period over here where we retested the lows and so you know I I look at this chart and I say well you know is there going to be some type of larger event like that where you go back down and and you sort of retest those lows and you know the there's there's certainly part of me that thinks that it's possible um I mean if it can if it can happen last cycle and if it can happen the cycle before that then why can't it happen this cycle you know um maybe you know maybe we get a flash crash or something that takes us back down makes everyone think that it's truly over and then it goes back up that I mean that's what happened last cycle but I can't promise that that will happen right I can't it could happen I me we could we could also come back down here and then go back up you know if you think about if you think about having your Roi one of the reasons that I think that you know it it it typically has Behavior like this is because by the time you get closer and closer to the election you know the the the politicians are going to want some type of looser monetary policy so that you're not going into the election with rising delinquencies in small businesses right I mean if if small business delinquencies continue to go up which is what's going on right now you know you're not going to want to go into an election with that right and so the way to sort of alleviate that is to go back to lower interest rates to go back to quantitative easing there and and again you know if you look at at Market expectations they're constantly changing um but what's funny is that now the market is not thinking the First Rate cut occurs until May not until May which is funny because May is right around the time that this occurs right where you can see that all prior three Cycles went up and also May would be when the next you know if it hasn't broken down in March maybe ether Bitcoin would then come back down to these lows by May right and then break down so you know I I I think when you know when I think about where we are in the cycle um I mean it certainly seems like we we were on that same fair value that we outlined about four years ago and that we talked about in this video but there is this looming thing of well what's going to make the FED go back to looser monetary policy right in 2020 it took a a pretty big event to go back to much lower rates right and to really turn the money printer back on over here in 2015 2016 we we did not have a recession um but we did have a recession scare right we we came close to a recession in 2015 and 2016 and if you look at where Bitcoin retested the the bull market support band and the 100 week moving average that was in February of 2016 well remember in February of 2016 if I show you what was going on that was when that was when basically the S&P it had this drop here late 2015 but then it had another drop in 2016 right and and you can see that when it had this drop that is when Bitcoin had this drop here back to the one 100 we moving average and the bullmark sport band and then last cycle last cycle when um when we had a hard Landing right you guys know what happened with the hard Landing right the S&P dropped a lot right I mean it it fell off a cliff and when that happened Bitcoin yes it went back to the bullmark sport band um but it also went to the 100 week and it went a lot lower and it and it more or less put in a a macro higher low and so there's a lot of volatility in the having year right but that's not always just to the upside it can also be to the downside as well often times the downside volatility is what causes looser monetary policy to come back into play right so you get some type of of major riskof event and after that RI and because of that riskof event the FED pivots and and then sometimes after they've pivoted enough they've gone back to sufficiently looser monetary policy and and and you know and and QE then you you sort of you put in your macro higher low whatever it's going to be over here you know it was a double bottom and then and then we went up this double bottom occurred on the first drop by the S&P right I mean if you guys remember what I was showing with the S&P um 2015 2016 right it had two drops right this there's this first drop here in August September there's a second drop here in February right and in in that second drop it got back to the 100 week the first drop it it put in the double bottom okay so having years are always interesting in that regards because you know the feds probably going to have more they're probably going to feel more pressure to to go back to looser rates sometime before the election so that's where we more or less are right now right bitcoin's between 40 to 50K um sort of still following this outline although the peak occurred at a completely different time um it's still following this outline but I I I do wonder if this is the next stop okay the bull Mark sport band around 36k which by the way I mean again a 36k Bitcoin while it might sounds scary it's only 15% below the yearly open and remember that's where basically all prior having years have gone at least was 15% below the yearly open so I think it's relevant to think that 36k could come into play um and that will it will be important to see what the reaction is at 36k because if there if if the Bulls do not come out to defend at 36k then the next level that you're looking at is all the way back down here at 31k okay so I'll say that again again if they can't defend at 36 then your next level of potential support is all the way down at 31 now remember last time we sliced through all that stuff and we went a lot lower time before that we held it as support so it it really just depends on on you know how the macro evolves is it continue to evolve very slowly if it does continue to evolve very slowly then bitcoin's more likely to hold these things you know one of these levels as support right whether it be the bullmark SP band or whether it be the 100 we moving average if the macro evolves more quickly and and things deteriorate more quickly then you could get something like this where you get a hard landing and then we go back to to you know to to loose your monetary policy a lot more quicker so again it depends on on on how things play out I think on the macro side that dictates just how deep a drop you can get now there's also the other view which probably merits our attention as well and that's the view that it doesn't break down at all Beyond this level right I mean there's there's some people out there uh that that have views that say it won't break below 40K right I know some people are are suggesting that and you know I do think the longer you're in crypto the more you recognize just how valid it is to listen to everyone's view okay because if you think about it at every at every turning point in the market there's always a lot of people that it's easy to laugh at people that have a different view right but it's important to listen to what those people are saying because they represent a certain percentage of of the population right if like if they think that then there's probably a lot of other people that think that too you know if if if someone thinks that this is going to be the high for a long time because this is where you know this was the the 618 retracement that we talked about you know 48k 482k this is where the um you know this is where the the spot ETF you know was was launched and we know that when you launch these products it can it can Mark highs for a while right but there's also someone out there that thinks the opposite and thinks that yeah like okay fine uh it's marked at least a local high but we just have to cool off for a little bit and then we'll go put in a higher high right so I think it's easy for no matter what camp you fall into to ignore the other view but consider both views as as useful views of the market and just know know that yes while you have your view there's also a lot of people that have a different view um and consider that and the reason I say consider that is because it's useful to hedge right it's always worthwhile to hedge in the market and and that means you know if you have if you have the view that that this is the high for a long time do know that even if you know even if we do come back into these levels there could be a reaction where people you know try to buy again and try to hold that as support whether it be here or whether it be over here but if Bitcoin let's look at lower time frames right if you look at like a 4H hour time frame you can see that 40K is a pretty important level okay so 40K this is the level that I'm sure everyone's watching right so you can see that we got above 40K here held us support here we did not we got close to testing it there but not quite and then we just tested it again so we've talked about 36k we talked about 30k Etc but until 40K breaks that Still Remains a question mark right now I would say if 40K breaks we're like going to go down to the to you know to to the mid-30s right 36k run the bullmark SP Bend if it takes another four weeks then maybe it's only 38k or something I don't know but if 40K breaks I think you you know you likely at the very least you come back down and you test this level right right here 38k so I I think that is a a a relevant area to say all right well if 40K breaks then 38k would be the next level which is where the bullmark sport Bend will be in you know in a few weeks right you know by the let's say by sometime in February around that 38k threshold so it'll be interesting to see how the how the market reacts at that level I am of the view that at some point at some point ether will break down against Bitcoin and normally that occurs you know on some type of of of Bitcoin balance it kind of goes back to the the the dominance video that we did yesterday right like dominance kind of sucks right now it's below its bullmark SW band but it's still trying to hold on right just like it was holding on right here for a while before it went back up so when I look at at at a chart like this right looking at at the Bitcoin dominance chart you know maybe it spends a few months or a few weeks you know sort of below the bullmark sport band but I can't help but think that at some point it's going to get another move up and and if and when it does then you know it could correspond to sometime out in a couple of months from now right a few months from now where then ether Bitcoin potentially finally breaks down so certainly a lot to consider um with this cycle and and how the and how the having stuff plays out the the the things I want to remind people of are that you know we do talk about the risk as much as we can we talk about the downside risk we talk about the upside risk um the downside being the bullmark sport band or the or the 100 we moving average in sort of a soft Landing type environment the a hard Landing scenario would would take you down to a you know to the prior lows right that's where a hard Landing scenario would take you and I do feel you know I I do feel like it's you know it can be the way that I talk about the markm is like it certainly could be thought of as as too risk averse right the reason why I say that let me show you this this um this view here and and this isn't a new view right I think everyone's aware aware of this View and if you're not then I you just haven't been watching um you know a lot of these videos but there there there's this idea and I again it's it's a dubious idea but it's the idea of of you know in your bare Market year you go to one regression band and then sometime later you go to the one below it which can correspond to a higher price right like this was this regression band we had a higher price but a lower regression man in the having year same thing over here right you go down to one regression man but eventually you you test the one below it and so that would sort of that's what I would consider to be a hard Landing would be if Bitcoin were to go and and test this regression band down here in some type of a a macro double bottom or a higher low or something like that right now the reason why it's risky for me to talk about this stuff is because while I will always say that my strategy for crypto investing is to DCA according to the risk levels that is what I do that is what is I I've always done that's what I plan to always do right I DCA according to the risk level and if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about it's it's this chart right here um this one so when the risk is low I DCA in when the risk is high I DCA out that's what I do now I sit on here talk about all sorts of possibilities all the time right we talk about whether Bitcoin bounces and breaks ether Bitcoin down we talk about whether bit Co gets you know some type of scare you know around the having and and leads to the FED going back to QE and and some type of macro retest we talk about all sorts of things right um but guess what I don't trade those views and I I I'm clear about that as frequently as I can be I don't trade these short-term views if the risk is low I buy if the risk is high I I start to sell and if you think about it it's not really the worst way to to go about about investing because otherwise you just spend all your time you know thinking about what if this and what if that what if you just say you set an alert you know if if x then y right if risk is below this level then I'll buy if risk is above that level then I sell and the rest of the time I'm enjoying my life right I'm not doing I don't care about about the other stuff I'm I'm just going to enjoy things and say all right well you know Bitcoin risk right now all right yeah it's it's at this level if it goes down to this level then I'll pick some up if it goes up to this level then yeah I need to take some profits right that's how I navigate crypto so I have to be clear about that and and and maybe I can do a better job of communicating that so when I say things like hey there is a risk that Bitcoin could go back down and and test the Integrity of these lows it's not like like I mean it's not like I'm I'm sitting there with you know with 100% cash waiting for some type of opportunity because the reality is is that even if that does occur even if we were to get some type of capitulation down to that level the truth is that 99.9% of people would not buy it anyways because they'd be watching for it to go lower so that's why I say you have to have a strategy and you just stick to it right you just stick to it no matter what happens okay so yes there is a risk that Bitcoin could could do what it's done previously right and and and and and put in some type of macro retest of the lows right there's a chance that it could do that there's also a chance that it doesn't do that right it's possible it's possible so again I think it makes sense to be HED either way right that way you know if Bitcoin does continue to outperform hey you have some Bitcoin but if we get some type of of massive drop then that's where you want to be you want you you want to make sure you have some money to buy the dop now I know what you're thinking you're probably thinking well you know isn't that the easy way out like to say well it could go up or it could go down we'll see here's the thing what I have said for the last two years is that the way that I hedge I don't really care how you hedge but the way that I hedge is I I just keep a Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio right that's the way I hedge now some people have hedged by keeping an ether heavy portfolio or an altcoin heavy portfolio but I hedge by just keeping my portfolio Bitcoin heavy the reason for that is because even in a scenario where you get a hard Landing I still think Bitcoin would eventually recover right even in a hard Landing scenario unfortunately I can't say the same about every single altcoin and why do you think we put out all these Bitcoin dominance videos you know for the last two years you think it's because I just think hey I just want to bore people to tears for an hour every every few weeks no right we talk about the Bitcoin dominance because of what I've said previously if you think dominance is going to go higher over the longer term which a lot of people have given me crap for that view but it's been going up you know I I think back to the to the thousands of interactions I've had on Twitter X um and on YouTube and everywhere where people laughed at this view of dominance going up and and my Bitcoin heavy portfolio you know oh all these altcoins will outperform it I look back and I say well you know those people can laugh all they want but they were wrong dominance has gone up a lot and I think it's going to keep going up now I'll admit I could be wrong about the and keep going up part often times dominance doesn't go that much higher in the having year and there's some case to be made that is the high on dominance there's some case to be made that it could be but I still think that until we get back to looser monetary policy dominance is still going to be skewed to the upside and as as it turns out looser monetary policy keeps getting delayed you know I mean it it was potentially going to be a March rate cut now it's shifted over to May next week maybe it shifts back to March but if it doesn't occur until May then I think dominance will just keep on grinding higher yes it could go slightly lower in the meantime but I still think it will go up so yes people can laugh all they want about the Bitcoin dominance view they control these hourlong Bitcoin dominance videos but at the end of the day you look at this chart and it is just been going up for a long time right so going back to Bitcoin in terms of oh so you're saying it can go up or down the point is I I can't predict the market market in terms of where it's going to go I can't I have no problem saying that if you know I I think to like think about all the hedge funds there are right all these hedge funds where you have so many smart people simply trying to perform outperform the S&P 500 and like almost none of them can right almost none of them can if you think about it all these hedge funds they have like you know they hire these Quant phds from you know from the best institutions and if all of these people in a room can't outperform the S&P then why do I think I can right I don't I don't um and so I can't I can't predict where the Market's going to go I think it's okay for people to say that I don't I don't really get why that's such a a um a controversial view to have I cannot predict where the Market's going to go next week next month I don't know we put out predictions some of them turn true some of them don't um you know this one looks like it's okay this one was wrong I mean we're we're fourth having we're between 40 to 50K potentially but the peak occurred at a different time so when I look at at at charts like this for for Bitcoin and I think well you know where where is it most likely going to go in the short term I think there's a case to be made that it'll visit the bullmark Scorpion I think it could go down to the 100 week and if we get a hard Landing it can go a lot lower than that but I'm not betting everything I have on that right DCA strategy is is probably going to be um it's the best strategy I think over a longer time period right um rather than trying to time the bottom because even in the event that we come back down and and and do get that scare it could be like that where literally no one buys it and everyone and and and and you know you buy some but a lot of people think it's going to go lower so those are my views um you know going back to the uh to the having year stuff if you look at 2012 2016 2020 2024 it's pretty normal to have a dip around this time and it's also pretty normal for that dip to last and not durably get back above the yearly open until you know April or something and there's still no guarantee that we can't go back down and and and and get a scare even after that it it really just depends on on how the uh how the macro unfolds but I do want people to have a plan going into this stuff remember it's the risk that you take right you have to figure out what risk you want to take on what you don't um how to be hedged for for various potential outcomes and and um just take it from there so those are my views on the market I just want to provide an update on on where we are in the having year right now I still do think ether Bitcoin will eventually break down but it you know it certainly could still be a couple of months away um I'm thinking the first half of the year is my best guess sometime in in H1 of of the having year is when ether Bitcoin will break down finally and after it breaks down I think that will within a within a couple of months I think that'll Mark the low on ether Bitcoin um but I don't think we're there yet but I do think we will get there so if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to

      "\n",
      "- Historically, bitcoin has seen a dip in the first 3 months after the halving, with the price dropping 15-30% from the yearly open. This has happened in the previous 3 halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The price has then typically recovered and returned to around the yearly open level after about 100 days (3 months).\n",
      "\n",
      "- There is a risk that bitcoin could retest the bull market support band around 36k (15% below the current yearly open of 42.3k) or even the 100-week moving average around 28k (a 30% drop) if we see a more significant pullback.\n",
      "\n",
      "- However, there is no guarantee this pattern will repeat exactly. Unexpected macro events could lead to a deeper or shallower correction.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The analyst suggests having a plan in place for various potential outcomes, rather than trying to time the market perfectly. A DCA strategy adjusting to risk levels is recommended over trying to perfectly time the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The analyst expects ethereum's dominance relative to bitcoin (ETH/BTC ratio) to eventually break down in the first half of the halving year, which could coincide with bitcoin's recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the historical pattern suggests a pullback in the first few months after the halving, followed by a recovery, but the exact magnitude and timing is uncertain and investors should be prepared for various scenarios.\n"

      "2. Many altcoins have been bleeding against Bitcoin for over a year, with their Bitcoin pairs dropping 80-90% in some cases. This \"altcoin reckoning\" is likely to continue, as altcoins struggle to hold support levels against a rising Bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The video suggests that while some altcoins may outperform in the short-term, Bitcoin is the safer play overall during bear markets and pre-halving years. Holding Bitcoin allows one to get exposure to the crypto market without taking on the higher risk of altcoins.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The presenter states that he would be \"much better off\" had he just focused on the rising Bitcoin dominance 18 months ago, rather than chasing altcoin gains, which have largely been wiped out.\n",

       "[[\"Video Transcript of youtube video 'NFA Live! The Bitcoin Halving' by 'Benjamin Cowen' released on 2024-04-18 00:00:00\\nvideo url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS-ramvvRFU\\n\\nHi, this is NFA live this should be a relatively exciting show for two reasons first of all we have the Bitcoin having coming up in just about a day and we also have a new guest with us today Max from because Bitcoin uh how you doing great thanks so much for having me Ben yeah and you started you started doing this a year or two ago is that right yeah probably about 18 months ago officially yep all right yeah so max is um I've known him basically since probably before he even started the YouTube channel or right around the time that he started it uh so make sure you guys go subscribe to him and Rob as well uh links to that are in the description below so make sure you guys check that out and we're just going to go through a lot of the different questions that I think would probably be on people's minds as we go into the having uh so let's just go ahead and jump in Rob we'll start with you on this one the having is tomorrow it's tomorrow we've been waiting forever here it is fourth having um and I'm guessing it's going to garnish some attention should be making some headlines different places I'm curious what what effects do you think the having will have on the larger crypto space um do you think it'll bring new eyes to the scene or are we still kind of just uh you know the same old same old people just kind of hanging out um do you think it'll it'll actually bring new new people to the space uh we saw a lot of new people come to the space last cycle sometime after the having um or do you think it'll be quiet for a while and do you see any narrative shifts after the Havoc that's a pretty loaded question first of all I would just like to say that Max has a great background I'm sure he got to the same place I did which is fivr and uh hopefully he didn't get ripped off but it looks great and uh I gotta tell you one of these days max we're gonna have to put that into an nft just me and you so yeah yes that is my old green screen but I'll be jumping in that green screen as soon as the uh as the Bitcoin hits 100K But to answer Ben's question which I think is is what uh everybody wants to really try to figure out is this Bitcoin having and I know like there's a lot of first of all that I still believe in the fouryear cycle some people say that it doesn't really register I still and some people will talk like Bob Lucas will say well it's just left translated and we're going to see a big blowoff top in 2024 which could very well happen but I still think that the narrative around it and there's still a lot of people say well there's Mass adoption coming and it's already here I still think it's I mean I don't think that we're at the same level like we should be and what we could be in like 2028 or 2032 or you know time comes up but Ben if you get to show my my screen real quick because everyone wants to know like well the Bitcoin having and you did a great I I watched your your video Ben about uh uh the ethereum evaluation ethereum ethereum valuation of Bitcoin about how you know Bitcoin dominance is going up and how it's wreaking havoc and it's true it is right now I know people will will also talk about you know like hey well you know these things happen leading up to the having but if we take a look back this is from Smart Valor it's a good website and if we take a look they did all the work for him which is great this is how Bitcoin behav in the year leading up to each having because we had one of course in 2012 2016 then 2020 and I know people will say well there's always a dip there's always this massive dip before the having and there could be I mean we saw one pretty massive one in 2020 but of course there's a reason for that and and we could either say like it's because of the of the almighty Corona virus or it was something else but yeah there was a dip in 2016 but again just take a look at this so with having with the having one in 2012 the year leading up to the having it went up to 385 per. and the year after of course because we always see alltime highs the year after so far it went up 5,000% having two in 2016 leading up to it 142% now there's dips along the way and we're seeing that right now but then a year after that in 2017 2 84% in 2020 even though there was a turbulent year like we talked about it was still up 17% for the year getting into that having in May I think it was May 12 2020 and then it went up almost five almost 600% the year after that and we can see here that that yeah same thing happened the year leading up to to the having on November 208th 2012 this is what Bitcoin was 250 and then of course we come up and then you can see right here that yes there is a a drop before that and then it comes up and there's a drop before but it's like the same thing as like a bull market so we're seeing the same thing kind of Replay I know it's a funny thing because like Ben you'll say like uh you say hey I I I told you that the Bitcoin ethereum evaluation was going to start to start to lose momentum or actually bleed away to ethereum and then people were going to blame a Black Swan event and they never would have saw it coming but here we are and again same thing happens here 2015 a year going into it yes it's not a straight line but we kind of I mean really rallied into it there's you know dips along the way but I mean it's going in that right direction and then of course 2019 to 2020 we started at 7325 we had it kind of flat and then we saw the almighty Corona virus right here but then we rallied into it so I still feel like the same thing's gonna Happ happen that's just how I see things and I'm I'm feeling pretty good about this having so far but the big question is and and we we'll talk about this later is what's the macro is there going to be quantitative easing or more quantitative Tiding are they actually going to cut rates are we going to have the liquidity that we absolutely need which we had beforehand even though we're in quantitative uh tightening right now I mean we still rallied pretty well but can we get that liquidity back in the market and that's I think that's the big question on top of the fact of are we going to see World War II so yeah that's where I got yeah it's interesting because you know at some point you would think we would need to make the shift from quantitative tightening to quantity to quantitative easing but what needs to trigger that shift is the is the is the thing that I I think we're kind of wrestling with um someone asked where a guy was I I should have mentioned that he's he's in Dubai and I mean there's obviously a lot of stuff going on right there going on right now there with the conference and um everything so he wasn't able to make it this week um so um Max I I'll put the same question to you I mean like what are your thoughts here on the Bitcoin having um is this just kind of the same old thing that we've seen before and everyone's trying to over complicate it uh do you see any kind of shifts coming after after the having what are your thoughts yeah I I would agree with the with the last part I think that a majority of people and it's very easy to do this I I tend to do it all the time is to sort of chronically over complicate something that has for over a decade now been a pretty reliable uh we'll just we'll call it a risk on event and in the simplest of terms all you need to do is you know pull up your trading view chart and Mark out every single Bitcoin having right you need at this point you know you need to draw four vertical lines whenever a Bitcoin having has occurred look at the the price action that has basically come almost immediately following so um you know I I try to look at this thing from Every Which angle you know I look at it from the side I look at it up side down I you know I try to include the macro and and fed policy in all of my decisionmaking but um you know the truth of the matter is this is a very unique time to be in the markets right Bitcoin is now on the global stage in my opinion for the first time um there is you know new on-ramps into crypto you know specifically being these you know nine ETFs um and it is you know there's more regulatory Clarity the accounting standards have shift did in a positive light and are working to you know become more friendly for corporations and big money to actually onboard into this digital commodity if they choose to do so um but again like Rob had mentioned and Ben like you commented on there also are some macro headwinds which can only be ignored for so long unfortunately I am of the belief that we do still have some time I believe we're maybe on borrowed time some people probably don't like to hear that but but I do believe that there is this this unique pocket of time where it's all coming together and we can really see risk perform um positively of course I don't have to tell you guys this and I probably don't have to tell the audience this but historically during a Fed pause until something has quote unquote kind of broken and we see Unemployment uh you know trending above 4% and the FED actually has to step in and begin easing through you know interest rate cuts and other measures um we can actually see risk you know being stocks and now crypto performed tremendously well and you know going back to you know to the last cycle you know we actually kind of went through a little mini fed cycle here and you know 2018 2019 and 2020 um you know where Bitcoin actually the floor kind of gave out we dropped to about 3K and then we had that famous rally into June of 2019 when we topped um you know there was actually hikes going into that and then of course right as Bitcoin basically topped in June of 2019 the FED began to actually cut rates um more or less right after that and it did dramatically affect Bitcoin some will say you know it was a reflexivity and you know we had to you know we we sprung hard off of that local floor so you know of course the market corrects to the downside some will say it's covid some will say it was in the charts the whole time some will say it's not I don't know you know nobody knows whether it would have happened with Co or or without um but again I don't think that this time really is that much different I think that every cycle has some distinct differences from from a previous one I mean for example last cycle we had a double top we haven't had a true double top before we have had a cycle like the 2013 one where we had you know two pronounced Peaks but a true double top had never happened before and additionally in the bare Market we had never spent as much time below the 200 WEA as we just did coming out of this most recent bear so there are you know of course Very recognizable and notable differences of every cycle but you to answer the question Point Blank I don't think that this time is much different and I I'm trying my best to not overthink it um and say you know what there is no reason for the FED to intervene at this point we're trending in that direction and we are on borrowed time there is a Day of Reckoning coming but I do believe at the earliest it's probably sometime in Q4 we have the having you know in less than two days and I do believe that there's plenty of room for risk to run in the short to Middle term maybe going out six months okay yeah no I mean it's great to get you guys opinions um and the market has been on an absolute tear I mean essentially after since October right I mean it was pretty boring summer last year but then since October uh the market has basically just been up only up until the last few weeks but um you know the next thing I'd like to talk about is of course Rob's absolutely favorite topic and it's of course Bitcoin dominance um and you know I you know you guys know My Views but I always like to get other other views because you know I'm I it's it's a good idea not to live in an echo chamber so Bitcoin dominance has once again broken a new highs I I we saw 57% actually it came really really quickly really quickly you know that that move to 57% it's kind of cooled off back you know it's back down to like the 55 like 55 and a half or so so it has cooled off quite a bit since that rally up to 57% uh so uh Max I'll start with you first on this one do you think it's going to keep going up after the having um you know it was it it was going up into the spot ETF and then it kind of waned a little bit following the spot ETF but then it just kind of picked right back up so what do you think is gonna happen this time and and this kind of goes to the whole like the last question as well like will there be a narrative shift and what people are focused on will they will they start focusing on more things besides you know sticking with Bitcoin um do you see you know what are your thoughts on that Max well first I have to give you a compliment Ben because you were one of the few people that with a big following publicly called Bitcoin dominance rallying to this point I didn't expect it to get up to I think it topped at what 57 recently or wherever did you you deserve a lot of credit for that well I'm known for riding Trends too long see well we'll see right nobody knows besides the market right like you know we we all have our our inclinations but uh you deserve a lot of credit because I remember months and months AG I don't it was probably six months ago plus we did a space together or you came on on my my channel because Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance was significantly lower and eth BTC was significantly higher and much has changed since then so kudos to you where do I think it goes from here so I think that Bitcoin dominance is in the process of we'll call it distribution okay I believe believe that the meat of the move is over um but that does not preclude it from going a little bit higher than here maybe maybe 60% that's not my base case but you know let's let's look left on the chart and you know use that to you know maybe forecast what could happen next so ignoring the you know whether this is a left translated cycle or an expedited cycle let's look at it contextually for where Bitcoin is at um you know from from a a p perspective right so Bitcoin actually has gone on to get above the previous cycle all-time high of 69k so most comparably again ignoring everything else but just pure levels on the chart pure you know where was the cycle High where was the cycle low you could probably compare Bitcoin right now to like December of 2020 okay if we just ignore everything else and say okay Bitcoin in December of 2020 went on to sweep the previous cycle all-time high of 197 it paused there for what maybe a month or or something like that it was chopping around altcoins got destroyed during that time right Bitcoin uncertainty like you always preach Ben uh when Bitcoin is uncertain alts get absolutely eviscerated and we are seeing that once again right so um again comparing this period of time to December of 2020 there is turbulence under the previous cycle all-time high which is not uncommon we saw that again last cycle and then also two cycles ago it seems to be sort of the same thing happening again what did we see in December of 2020 well what we saw was Bitcoin dominance basically put in a deviation or bull trap High where on when Bitcoin finally decided it was time to push through with conviction above the previous cycle all-time high of 197 you saw Bitcoin dominance put in an explosive move which ultimately ended up being sort of a bull trap you know for for the Bitcoin Maxis um so I I think it's possible we are seeing that Devi that deviation high right now only time will tell um I do have hedges in place you know like I'm I'm holding some Bitcoin l2s like STX and some Bitcoin ordinals and things like that that I think would be beneficiaries of you know Bitcoin dominance continued rally maybe above 60% um but of course you know I I really I am of the belief that contextually with Bitcoin chopping under the previous cycle all-time high seeing similar signs of Bitcoin dominance putting in you know this this last explosive push I do believe that over the next six months or so it would probably makes sense to see Bitcoin dominance Trend down dramatically and additionally and and I don't mean to you know bring this up because I don't know if this is on the agenda today exactly I imagine that that would translate to eth BTC finding a bottom sooner rather than later but that doesn't again preclude it from going down a little bit more and only time will tell yeah no I mean it's great and I mean I I I think it's always worthwhile to hear these other views because um you know no one really knows right I mean you know no one really knows and you know one thing that I've wrestled with a lot before and I've seen other people do this too is like you know just because someone gets something right doesn't mean they're going to be right they're going to keep being right right and also just because someone gets something wrong doesn't mean they're GNA be keep being wrong I mean you know markets change no one knows what's going to happen and I I I could see eth Bitcoin carving out a bottom this summer um that's kind of my base case I could see that actually happening so we'll see if that happens Rob what are your thoughts I mean I know you're you're more of a you're more of a Bitcoin Maxi yourself right Bitcoin dominance to 100% I yes exactly go ahead Ben what was your question I'm just kidding I'm just kidding what what are your thoughts here on on on dominance do you think it's uh you think we're getting pretty close to the uh to the top well first of all let me just say that I I I was like listening to to Max especially on like the Twitter spaces and things like that he's very smooth in his delivery and very smart and and what he talks about so I gotta tell you it's good to hear like different sets of opinions it's great to have a Max here so to talk about I mean Bitcoin dominance I got to tell you like when you were talking the 60% I'm like yeah you know I can kind of see it you know I was I was I was under the assumption like well you know it always kind of comes back that way right something happens there's something that happens in the market a Black Swan event or you know something that's just that kind of has disruption and then people get scared and they're they're like okay I'm risk on but not that risk on to go into like you know Pepe coin I'm gonna go into the safest asset in the most volatile industry which would be Bitcoin and I I could see that for sure but then like there's a narrative that that people are always talking about especially in in in the crypto space being the Bitcoin maxos are going to say Bitcoin only right but there are narratives that are out there one of those is dpin Right centralized physical infrastructure Network the other one are dexes because we see what's going on with the centralized exchanges getting sued getting their pants sued off by the SEC and then leaving of course so we have to have dexes and then of course there's another big one which is web 3 so we talk about that but there's one that I feel is on an undertone and Max alluded to it when he was talking about it when he talked about runes and he talked about ordinals and he talked about things like stacks and l2s and I think what's gonna really push Bitcoin dominance up I know Ben loves this part too is uh the the l2s or even l1s that are going to be built on bitcoin Ben if you just throw this this chart up I always talk about this website it's l2. watch so imagine this and I and and and even like Adam back has talked about this how he's talked about he hates the fact that everybody's building off of Bitcoin people should just build on bitcoin because he says it's like it's it's like the tcpip layer for for the internet so why can't they just build on the most the safest most secured Network or computerized Network ever built in the entire world and he was right so when I take a look at these these l2s that are coming out and they're all new so you I to understand like this some most of these are trash let's just let's just call it SP Spade but like when we talk about things that are coming out that are actually doing pretty good like a Stax who's been around for quite some time I can really see things actually happening for sure and then like I just dropped a a video on my second Channel where I talked about core core is a top uh 50 well it's 56 now but it's essentially an L1 L2 type of uh uh token which is built right on top of Bitcoin using delegated proof of work and delegated proof of stake together to actually make dexes nfts and a whole host of things you can only do with smart contracts so when I see stuff like this happening I'm like why can't we take away the nonsense that's going on over in ethereum world and they're massive gas fees like just like with with core and stacks right now if you use it or the things that are being built on top of it they're just going through their Satoshi initiative it's super cheap and it's super fast so for me to see that Bitcoin dominance could go up why couldn't it especially with the different institutions that are here and how they've been drilled into it now they can say oh there's something else I can do and also smart I see it could actually go above 60% but again I'm not always right no I mean I I've it's possible it's certainly possible um I think the answer is going to probably come in the next few weeks because you know there's two prior examples where we had these kind of these like closes below the 8we ese 2021 and 2019 and in 2021 after it happened Bitcoin got a rally eth Bitcoin went up but in 2019 when Bitcoin got that rally eth Bitcoin went down so I think if we see Bitcoin get some type of relief I don't know maybe sometime after the having into may I I don't know exactly when it would be but whenever that comes whatever happens to eth bitcoin should be very telling about where we are in the cycle so I I'm going to be focused a lot on that um over the next few weeks but we will see um next question Rob I'm GNA start with you on this one to rotate and you know I remember last year you saying something like this um and and you ended up being correct it was basically you know sell and man go away um like I mean no one's D Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear since October I mean you know I mean it was basically like 25 to 30k not even that long ago um and I I think sometimes we forget just how quickly it has moved so I'm curious like do you think it's going to be similar to last summer where we just get the market gets boring before maybe moving up again like later in the year or something you think it's just going to get boring for a few months um do you think or on the other hand do you think everyone's gonna get think it's boring and then we just get another you know face what's it called like a face melting Rally or something that's exactly face yeah I mean like so so what are your thoughts going into the summer because I mean again I know last summer you you thought it was going to be boring do you think it's going to be boring again this summer or you think it's going to be different Matt well first of all I I hope so I I really do because everybody who's in the chat right now answer a question for me uh tell me if you think that you've accumulated enough where you're like you know what I've bought plenty of Bitcoin and I just cannot handle any more bags I just I don't want to buy anymore especially if it goes down and gets cheaper just let me know in the comment section because it seems like when these types of things Ben when you say things are boring this is great because this is when people who like the dollar cost average is fantastic or if you're Dynamic DCA is things go down which I think where we at the risk levels now 0.6 0.59 somewhere around there a little yeah I think a little above 0 six so like if we're in this place we're like well I mean for me this is a good time to just accumulate a little bit but as we start to like if it goes sideways well great I have more time to bring things in but then if you if you want to talk about selling May and go away there's this great chart on this website that I steal from constantly and if you just take a look because it's it's yeah it's a nice website it's very nice I think there's a sale going on until like tomorrow and then it goes away so but if if you say sell in May and go away it it actually works out pretty well I mean historically speaking but then if you really want to break it down because people say but Rob you don't get it because this is the having year so it's all it doesn't really it count well if you take a look at it I mean if you sold at the end of May of 2020 I mean you had a 30% increase on January a couple of drops there 34 and 10% and then you're down here and you just kind of stay away until October and then you buy in and then October rallies November rallies and December rallies that's not bad I mean I'll take that year right and if we go back to 2016 I mean it's the same type of thing if I want to sell in May okay well June's gonna go up but I have red red I take I stay away September as well and I I buy back in October November December I'm doing pretty good so I still think it can work out all right the thing that you have to understand though and one more thing is is this there's a presidential election I think this is going to be pretty tumultuous as we get into it so there was this piece from hbk's wealth and it talked about the presidential election years versus the non-election as far as returns and this is just taking a look at the S&P 500 you can see that in the presidential election years which this is that year it sends to like kind of peek off around March April and then just kind of fall away until we get into junisha may go away October is here you buy back in and then we have a nice little rally of course drop here and then off we go but 10% for that year is not too bad now does that mean that I'm going to sell everything no no I'm just telling you these are just the data points that we can say take a look at me personally I'm just here to accumulate and uh get into some early round type of cryptos that could either make a lot of money or go to zero one of those two will always happen yeah I was looking at this um this is uh this is the S&P 500 in 2024 compared to the average of all election years right I mean so you can see like it has come down a lot recently but it also went up a lot too like way more than it does on average so there's just been a lot more volatility this cycle than I think we've seen in a lot of Prior Cycles um but yeah I I thought that was interesting and that chart sort of reminded me of that uh Max what are your thoughts here I mean I know earlier you said you expected uh risk to do pretty well um over the next six months but you know even with that do you think that the market could cool off before that phase or do you think it's not going to really get much of a breather or do you think the Breather is almost over yeah that's it's a it's a great question of course we're all from relatively familiar with the uh maybe cliche but overused but also kind of accurate saying of sell and may go away um one thing that I've been preaching for a while going back to I mean even I would say Q4 of last year is that I was seeing signs early on of a maybe expedited cycle for crypto um and it's probably off of of you know the back of this this fed paw and there isn't quite as much in my opinion economic deterioration as a lot had thought myself included and we're in this you know kind of Goldilocks window where risk can rally really unencumbered um you know so so do I think that selling may go away will come to fruition I I would think that worst case in my opinion from what I'm seeing right now and again of course subject to change it's just one man on the internet's opinion I think that similarly to how this cycle for crypto is being a little bit front Rand and we've actually seen for the first time a Bitcoin all-time high before a having which of course had never happened before um I also think it's possible that selling may go away is being front ran a little bit and we're seeing that right now with this April correction so similarly to Rob I am not I am not in the camp of you know drisking or selling spot because again like I mentioned in you know during our first question here if you just draw four vertical lines on your trading View and Mark out every Bitcoin having look what typically happens in the six to nine months following Additionally you know for a lot of us that have been slowly you know and thoroughly meticulously dcing into our digital digital assets and our unregistered Securities over the past year you know a lot of us have tax consequences for selling right now and I'm I'm not really interested in incurring any uh you know tax consequences trying to reposition because May perhaps is a little bit choppy so in my opinion you know and again going back you know the past 18 months for Bitcoin we haven't seen more than a 22% correction on bitcoin so from our local high recently take it down 22 to 25% maybe you get 57 56 worst case that's not enough for me to incur you know a taxable event to try to reposition so uh maybe it happens maybe it doesn't but for me ultimately it doesn't make a big difference because the having is in a couple days um and typically what happens after a having is months and months of prosperity and hopefully price discovery yeah no it's a fair point I mean I think like all the corrections that we've had by Bitcoin for the entire bull market have only been about 20 to 22% yeah we've already seen it go down about what 18% or so um so that I think that'll be the the area I mean if we get down there see if it turns around and if it does maybe the time's not different you know but yeah what do you think Ben do you think selling May and go away will come to ahead um I think now I mean so I so we went into the 7 to point8 risb in March so that I think was the time to to drisk some kind of like during the spot ETF um at this point it's kind of like when we went back to 39K after the spot ETF um we then it was it was a 22% drop and then we just rallied after it right and and so I was like you know this could be our preh having year dip and then the rally just continued and so now it's kind of the same thing it's like you know the the area to do it if you were convinced about it would have been in in March you know um when gold broke out because that's actually in 2019 when Bitcoin topped was when gold broke out um so I think that would have been the time to do it now I do think there is a risk of if you've waited if you've waited till this point and now bitcoin's down 20% we did see both in after the 20209 or the 2019 top and the 2021 top the first weekly close bow of the 8we SMA we then had a rally back up you know to the we right which is around 67k we actually went slightly above it in both cases so I think what what's more important is not exactly what happens here at the range lows but it's what happens whenever we get a relief move does it sustain or does it just put in a lower high I think that is kind of the thing to look for because back in after the spot ETF it wasn't a lower high we just you know had another face ripping rally fire um the the reason why I am more cautious on this one than than the last one is because eth Bitcoin has now broken down and gold is broken out which both of those events marked the 2019 local top and it wasn't the market cycle top and this kind of goes back to what Rob was saying you know there is this idea of a left translated peak in 2024 and I can sort of like I'm like 30% maybe 40% aware of that like you know thinking hey this is this could actually happen you know if if we were to Rally into the summer to higher prices without cooling off then I would be very more so convinced of a left translated Peak but what if what if if you think about what happened after the 2019 top after gold broke out and after e Bitcoin broke down Bitcoin went into a six to n month bare Market in fact now imagine you get that after the having and everyone thinks the cycle is over by the end of 2024 because it just hasn't done anything since the having and then we just get another move in 2025 and then the cycle Peaks when it always does and once again everyone over complicated it you know like there is a chance that that that happens um so I would I think I would just watch to see what happens whenever we get any type of relief does it form into a lower high or does it lead to a higher high and then you probably have your answer to whether it's a left translit cycle or not at that point I can see absolutely yeah and again even in 2019 it was it was just a local top we bled for a while we actually bled back to the 100 we SMA um and then and then we started to go back back up and then we had the we had the pandemic crash but if you ignore that it was just sort of a bleed after all Bitcoin pairs broke down and then and then once we got that back you know we start to go back up those are my and and by the way I mean you've always said this going back when you know before I started my business and I was watching all of your videos you know years ago Ben you used to always say something kind of along the lines of you know the longer it takes you know the higher will ultimately go something along those lines and you know I think a uh this idea of a prolonged sort of midcycle Correction freaks a lot of people out because everybody wants to be rich overnight myself included right of course i' I'd love for us to just go straight up in a straight line and I hope that we do but ultimately I don't think it would be a death sentence for Bitcoin to kind of reestablish value between 55 and 75k for even a full quarter um you know I think ultimately would probably lead to more constructive uh price action to the upside in the long run but people you know their patients will be tested no question yeah yeah I mean I think the the the thing to look for in the cycle I think is is the Bitcoin dominance I I really do think it's the key for the cryptoverse and I think I think that dominance will Top before Bitcoin Falls below the 20we SMA that's my guess is that it's going to top before Bitcoin Falls below it and I think between now and then Bitcoin gets occasional rallies that just take off Bitcoin pairs even lower is my guess um so that's why I just say like you know if you want exposure to crypto Bitcoin I mean you know Bitcoin is is a relatively safe bet if you want to take on more risk there's obviously the altcoin market there's the full DJ mcoin Market um but you have to be careful with those and I I I think the winning strategy with the altcoin market and and even if you are in the riskier memec coin stuff is just to remember like in five years that Meme coin is probably not going to exist No One's Gonna care about it because they're going to be worried about the next stage of mean points right so the way the way to navigate it is it's okay to have exposure to various parts if you want to take more risk but just occasionally convert it back to bitcoin if you make a lot of money right because at least you know you then know hey Bitcoin is still going to be around in 10 years I don't know if this random meme coin is Ben how could you say that how dare you my a meme coins oh my I think I've converted most of my audience to bitcoin Maxis at this point but I will say by the time I convince the last person to be a Bitcoin Maxi that's when the dominance tops out and we go back the other way I don't think we're that far away I think maybe this summer dominance tops out we'll see though but you are correct like what anybody out there like if we're being completely honest Would You Bet Your Life that Your Meme coin or your altcoin is going to be around in 50 years would You Bet Your Life on it I probably would not would I bet my life I mean it's an extreme example right would I bet my life or something valuable that Bitcoin will be around bet your would you bet all your money on it or something right that's much more friendly right so and I would for Bitcoin I have a high degree of confidence and that's why your strategy ultimately it's conservative you know relative to a lot of other people that you know talk about crypto publicly but it is ultimately a long-term winning strategy and people need to recognize that profits from altcoins ultimately do have to flow back into Bitcoin that is the sustainable strategy for sure yeah I mean I think Rob I think Rob was talking about this what last week on NFA live we were talking about like what do you do when you get an airdrop and I think what was your strategy like just 50% you take profits on it right away 50% back to bitcoin or USD and then you let there oh no no it was you let let it go up 2X or something or if it goes up 2x then you sell 50% was that what you said yeah I I call it well two things I call it the half and half method so you get into meme coins or something crazy and then let's say you put it you know 100 bucks in and then it goes $200 so then you sell half immediately and you put the other hundred bucks let it ride because that's house money then when it doubles or triples or or quadruples then you take half again or you take two or three or 4X what do you want to do and then you let the ride and you do that until there's no more riding and it just goes away and then you're like well okay I I did 8X but it went to zero so I don't feel so bad because a lot of people just let it go all the way up and all the way down but if you just play with house money there's a reason why like like I I can see people in the in the chats going well this sucks because you know now we're gonna sideways and you know this isn't what I want to be there's a reason why all three of us are pretty much just like on all of our videos on all of our Twitter spaces we're pretty much the same person whether it goes massively up or way way down me's a little bit of excitement but it's because we der risked enough to like well if this happens then we do this if this happens we do that and I think that's where people should would want to be as opposed to just going okay I sold my kidney I hope this memec coin goes up it's one of those things have a plan no matter what and then enjoy your life don't stress about it right I mean have a plan like you know if Bitcoin goes to 50K or even lower so what have a plan if it goes up have a plan I mean it I I think you know I used to navigate crypto without without thinking about like what do I do if this happens I only would navigate it based on one particular outcome I never hedge myself but once I started hedging My Views then it makes things easier you know you're like all right well this is what I think but if I'm wrong I don't want to be you know completely left out of whatever that next trend is um and when I when I get air drops um well I don't I don't really get air drops anymore because I'm not really that active in in the space but when I did when I used to get air drops my strategy was immediately convert half of it to bitcoin at least half to bitcoin and then let whatever else ride because like half the time they would just go to zero anyways um so at least you get some of that value out in inss um why don't we goe and move on because we do have two more questions and then I'd also like to get to audience questions at the end if you post your question now I probably won't see it so maybe wait like 10 minutes and then post it um this is an interesting question and I to be completely honest most people aren't going to care but gold is is one of these things where like it doesn't do anything for like 10 years you know and like if you think about this entire bitcoin's like like it's entire history essentially since 2009 gold has essentially gone nowhere in that in that entire phase but we just saw gold break to new all-time highs and it seems to be a somewhat explosive rally so I'm curious about what your thoughts are on gold um I I often think that people who like gold are are more alike to people who like Bitcoin than they would care to admit I think the main difference is the generation that we are right so if I were born one or two generations ago I probably would have been really into gold you know but because I'm born into more of the digital age I'm more into Bitcoin so I think we're more alike than different um so I'm curious like what your thoughts are on gold here it is now 2300 2400 um max where do you you know do you think that uh this is going to continue I me Silver is also not too far behind it in its own move um and I guess the other question is like why do you think gold is rallying so that's probably the bigger question is is why do you think it's rallying rather than like what do you think it's going to go to sure yeah the gold strength is um pronounced it's very impressive um and and I would say I mean why do people buy gold historically right it's sound money it was sound money before Bitcoin it was a store of value when you know our our parents generation was nervous about the state of the world they would you know convert their into gold and uh you know a lot of it is more of a um it's a mental thing it's a it's a mental insulation it's not like if your country was invaded you're going to put you know 500 pounds of gold on your back and somehow travel to another country right but it's a it's a peace of mind thing you know and you know again historically it is you know a sound currency uh there is a scarcity aspect to it there's a lot of commonality and overlap between gold and Bitcoin and I think everything you mentioned Ben is correct um I would say that my bias on gold um really stems more on my perspective and my my forecast on where I think dxy is headed and similarly where I think Bitcoin is headed I've already shared my opinion on where I think Bitcoin is going we have the Bitcoin having just around the corner um I expect Bitcoin to you Trend upwards aggressively over the next six to nine months subsequently I do believe that dxy is forming a sort of distribute you know a distribution here I do anticipate dxy topping very soon and again if you just overlay gold with dxy on a weekly chart you can see that there is a pretty prominent negative correlation between dxy and gold so I don't think we're I'm not of the opinion that we're going to see a decoupling where there's suddenly a a prolonged period of a positive correlation where gold rallies and dxy rallies I think that one of them is lying so either gold is lying or dxy is lying I think that gold is leading and going to see dxy of course sort of reclaim that negative correlation and begin to take a dive over the next quarter so um I do expect gold to continue upwards and I think it's probably off the back of the you know dxy weakening okay yeah fair enough um it has it has been really strong you know and I I can't help but look at it I'm like wow you have like a 10-year base I the bigger the base the more explosive the rally and for I mean for I know like all the crypto you know Deens are like you know it's up what like 10% or something and like people are like you know like 10% is like a minute candle on a meme coin right but for gold you know for an asset that's that high market cap like that is a big move in a really short period of time and so like that's why it it it means something Rob what are your thoughts here um are you are you are you watching this gold move I'm not watch I mean but I own it I own gold and silver and I I think and I don't I never UND and we talk about this many times I never understood why the old maximalists and this and the precious metal maximalists hate Bitcoin so much because like you said we're trying to all do the same thing we're trying to get out of the Matrix which is relying on paper Fiat and it just seems like I there's there's that one gold bug guy that is what we all talk about for some god- awful reason but in reality I think for the majority of people that are into precious metals I think they can see the value behind it and of of of Bitcoin itself and like I I like I never understood with this guy like why don't we have a debate between that guy and like Mike Maloney Mike Maloney is huge into gold he's put out a great series on precious medals and he's he likes Bitcoin as well so like when I take a look at this I I think you know why why not own why not old gold why not diversify like you know uh we've got I diversify not just in the crypto but the stocks precious metals and and real estate and I think everybody should do the you know kind of do the same thing but to talk about why gold went up so much let me I I don't know but how did gold do in 2022 was there any kind of rally during that time I mean it it it it still mostly stayed below the high I don't really think it did that well um it's only recently really started to show strength I mean I can I can pull it up and see but 2022 was kind of split it rallied in the first half of the year and then didn't really do too much and actually corrected a little bit looks like yeah I mean it looks like it topped in March of 2022 and then basically just went down yeah till November and then it rallied again into December kind of there there's a theory going around about why Gold's rallying so much it's because the Nations that are going to war they are trying they're fearful of us sanctions so how do how do you get away get around those sanctions well you stockpile Alternatives and one of those would be of course gold so people are talking about how Iran could be could have stockpiled after the Damascus situation and the and the bombing and the reason why I ask about 2022 is because for the Ukraine Invasion I think was February 2022 and the same type of thing was being said about Russia stockpiling gold at the same time so I can see I can kind of see that that valuation I don't know why they don't just use Bitcoin it's a heck of a lot easier to transfer and zip around value but that's where we're at yeah I always like I always think those posts by the gold bugs are so disingenuous because I mean like I I own both like I own Bitcoin and gold but like if you go to trading View and you look at the Bitcoin or you look at the Gold valuation against Bitcoin it's down so much since Bitcoin launched that it rounds it to negative 100% like like that's how far the valuation of gold has fallen against Bitcoin since Bitcoin has been around so again like it's not it's just look I mean the the Bitcoin valuation as far exceeded gold for a long time um I mean my guess is over the next 20 years Bitcoin will still outperform gold you know maybe in the short term gold could outperform uh Bitcoin but and I I mean I guess it has been since March right ever since gold broke out Gold's been doing better than even the S&P 500 even the NASDAQ um it's been having my view is that I I I think that gold is breaking out because it senses that um rate cuts are coming sooner than the market is potentially thinking and so that's kind of why I think I I think it's sort of sniffing something out just like it did in 2019 and and um but we'll see I mean you know we'll see if it if it plays out in the same way last question and I mean I you know this is more so geared towards Max um because I mean Rob is I mean you know you've been around here forever we' probably even asked this question you before yeah but I mean if you want to take it if you want to answer you can Max Max yeah so since you're new here um why did you start your YouTube channel I mean like what what was your motivation what are you helping to accomplish with it uh what brings you here well Ben you you actually played a big role in in bringing me here I was a very early follower of yours actually before you even had your website I bought your Google sheet way back in the day and I'm still locked into my original price thank you very much because I got in early pays to get in early um you know I I learned a lot from you in the very beginning and I went through last cycle and you know Ben and and Rob also this you know this is a compliment to both of you guys amongst a sea of grifters and thieves and people looking to prey on unsuspecting retail you know guys like yourselves you you conducted yourselves in a manner that you know I mean I can't even imagine how many millions of dollars you guys turn down from shill deals and you know crap like that and you know I I wanted to in the beginning play my you know play my part in that I felt as though I had opinions that you know um I could share something to offer I have you know I have an ability to lead I have you know an ability to organize a team um and I wanted to play my my part my equal share in the sort of collective hive mind of you know CT and and YouTube and help educate that's sort of the underpinning of of what I'm doing is I like to teach I like to collaborate and you know making money certainly feels nice right but there's a certain there's a certain sense of fulfillment that I personally get out of somebody messaging me saying hey because of what you said it made a difference in my life and something clicked for me and that feels really good and you know I I started because Bitcoin and it was it's a small Channel still um we're growing quickly certainly which of course if you go to Ben's beautiful website and you overlay social media growth with uh you know the price of Bitcoin you can see why I'm starting to grow quicker it's it's I'm doing the same thing I was doing all bare Market it's just suddenly more people care about crypto so um you know I am a i a result of good times and I pray that they continue on because of course it's you know a nice Tailwind for for my young business but yeah I mean really to answer the question Point Blank I love to teach I love to to collaborate and I love to debate you know like I have a differing opinion than you know you guys for some things and there's some overlap but that's what makes a market beautiful is that you can think one thing I can think another and we can come together and just talk about it politely and nobody knows what's going to happen right like we can't I have my hunch I have conviction just like you guys do but Bitcoin dominance could go to 90% And you know even over flip it and put that on on Twitter don't do that don't do that or or it could literally nuke down to 10% we could have like the crypto equivalent of the NASDAQ bubble between 1995 and 2000 where altcoins bubble like people you know can't imagine everybody's thrown money at altcoins speculating anything that's crypto and then 99 out of 100 of them don't exist in a couple years you know so who who knows what's going to happen but yeah I love to to collaborate and teach and debate and uh generally it's it's just a passion of mine how many subscribers are you guys at now like 13 14k or something yes on YouTube somewhere in between there yeah well there's 3,600 people watching so if everyone here goes and clicks the link in the description below and goes over to Max's Channel and subscribes then uh I I'm sure he would appreciate that and I think he deserves that he's been they've been putting out they it's not just Max by the way I mean it's a team of people um so go check that out you guys do like daily live streams right we Yeah we actually have a show coming up at uh 10:00 a.m. eastern time we do a Daily Show we've got a panel of Five Guys we're all just Traders wrap this one up then if you got it coming up in 10 minutes that's okay I got a big team they got it all right well before we before we end it here I I did want to take at least a couple of questions um and one of the questions I saw was um what is the best way to learn about crypto and to do your own research so I mean I don't know if they're talking about like from a fundamental perspective but I if someone were getting into crypto like like what do you guys use to do your research and I mean and maybe talk about like all the different tool or some at least some of the bigger tools that you guys have been using especially for all the different things that are happening in the cryptoverse there seems like there's a thousand different narratives that you could you know that you could follow and whoever wants to take that one is fine go ahead Max yeah um I would start on uh one of our three channels I think that's a really good place not to not to spew the obvious but um I would say I would say learn to do very basic ta right and understand Cycles like there's some very awesome free indicators out there like I mean you can even just look at like you know Ben has a a you he's kind of coined a very famous one he's combined a 20 week SMA and a 21 we EMA which has been sort of uh marketed as the bull market band for good reason right so you can determine when you know Bitcoin is trending upwards High time frame or trending down by just a simple you moving average band there's also things like the P Cycle top which I think people should keep an eye on which is again a free trading view indicator someone someone made it it's also on Ben's website there's also some some good onchain stuff like you know Bitcoin terminal price hoddle waves things like that I would as a beginner I would stay off the hourly time frame like literally just go daily time frame and above um and whenever you see Bitcoin down you know 50% from its its all-time high that's time to start paying attention to maybe consider entering the market but you know learn very very basic ta and and some of the more popular onchain indicators can really help you just DCA at the right time you know but stay off of the hourly time frames mainly the py cycle top just to give credit is uh was developed by Philip Swift um a while back and I the the idea was to predict the top with within 3 days and it did a really great job of doing that in the first uh the first 2021 Peak um and it actually happened I remember it happening and like no one really believed it you know um but I think it was retrofit right it was fit after yeah it was created in 2019 it was created in 2019 okay but it did it did get the first top in 2021 I feel like a lot of these like metrics that everyone created in 2019 uh it they called the first top but then most of them like didn't really call the second top because it was just sort of like a it was like a dead cat bounce that just somehow made it to New highs you know yeah um so yeah that was kind of an interesting one um Rob did you have anything to add just yeah just one thing Max makes all great points the thing I would say is that if you really knew you really really knew you have to understand that it's not how much you make it's how much you keep and the big thing is that you have to watch out for scams and things to watch out for and if you're gonna get into like hot storage wallets stuff like that there's a there's a video in the in the link of in the description of all my videos and it says you know things you the the big mistakes in crypto and it has like 20,000 views and of course it's the most important video I probably have ever put out because that's what people get screwed out and they get scammed out and if they watch that video they wouldn't happen to them another video I did when I'm gonna sell on my crypto has over 100,000 views so it just goes to show you like where the priorities are the priorities are make money but really the priority should be keep money someone's asking a um this the Market's not pricing it in right now but I did see like last night there's been a couple of times here where like there's at least some in investors like thinking about a rate hike um that is not like my base case at all like I think they're done I I think five and a half percent is the terminal rate for this cycle they might go higher next cycle uh but I I think five and a half percent at the top I'm not going to ask you if you think they're gonna hike again because I don't really think any of us think they're going to um if you do think that let me know but I guess my main question is what do you think would happen if they did hike again um because that be I mean that would talk about markets not pricing it in right I mean like I guess the the implication would be like if if the economy just accelerates into you know again and and there's not a cool down and we just keep on moving up uh what would a rate what would another rate hike do well what was real quick what was what is what has Jerome Powell said about fighting inflation do they say that they're on the right track or do they say like there's it's more more stubborn what he they've kind of like the progress has slowed a lot and I I think they've kind of specul that it it might influence their the number of rate Cuts this year because previously they had said three rate Cuts this year and I'm I'm wondering if they're starting to walk I mean now the market is pricing in only two rate cuts through April of 2025 so I my view is that you know I thought higher for longer but now that everyone else believes it I think I think it's going to go back the other way because once the market fully prices in no rate Cuts that's when people give up and you need to start having some rate cuts um but yeah I don't know I mean pal Po's basically said the same thing he said for the last three years if you know they're they're going to keep rates higher for longer until inflation's durably going back to 2% yeah I I think that 3% is is the new 2% truthfully I I I appreciate their narrative and their consistency and and how they haven't wavered on that and I think it's a great goal um but it seems like three is kind of a magnet actually a little above three um like you mentioned they are currently pricing in now it looks like you know our first 25 basis point cut on the uh September 18th meeting and then through April 2025 and and these percentages change all the time right uh you know we'll see what happens um you know potentially taking us down 50 basis points off of where we're currently at um let me answer your question what would happen if we got another 25 basis point hike because you know inflation decides it's going to rear its ugly head again and and start trending up above you know headline four 5% God forbid it's over I mean like we are going to absolutely nuke if we get another rate I'm gonna be as as clear as I can be if we get another rate hike markets are going to capitulate like that will be awful horrible for risk like sell all of your assets honestly like if that happens I'm not joking I think it'd be terrible I don't know if you guys agree with me but that would be horrible for markets but I don't think that's going to happen to be clear I think you could have the same thing happen if they just refuse to cut soon enough too because like it it you know like a tightening cycle is not just raising rates but it's also keeping rates too high for too long and the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and eight would have been in March um so we've already gone nine I think there's still you know there's still a window where talks about a soft Landing right it's so hard to thread that needle to a soft Landing because you have to stay high enough to make sure inflation doesn't come back in a second wave because if you don't and you get an inflation a secondary wave like the 70s you get a hard Landing but if you stay high for too long like let's say they stay at five and a half percent for another six months then you start to run the risk of of a deflationary crash right so that's why everyone sort of rolls their eyes about a soft Landing is because it's so difficult to thread that needle and I don't I do not envy their job I I do not envy their job because it's not and and they're also operating with long and variable lags like how can they know all the effects of prior monetary policy um so yeah it's it's a tough place for them to be and and we are oh sorry Rob go ahead no no go ahead Max I was going to say you know we are seeing some smaller economies in my opinion forecasting when our rate cuts are coming like we have seen the Czech Republic actually start to cut we've seen Poland cut um so it you know historically it's not perfect right but you are starting to see some of these smaller countries actually they they LED through the hik so they began to hike first they paused first and they've actually started to cut so I I do anticipate that you know in similar fashion to what has happened historically we will see the US begin to I guess cut rates hopefully uh later this year um but I do agree with you Ben like if they held rates where they're currently at through you know all of 2024 that would also put some pressure um on our economy and our markets but with that said like I don't know what you you guys think but I mean really the the final you know real dagger or Domino to fall is going to be of course unemployment creeping up above four four and a half percent do you guys think that if they just held rates where they're currently at all through 2024 um but we didn't see the labor market really deteriorate could financial markets hold up in that instance I mean if if the labor market doesn't deteriorate sure I just think that um I mean it seems like the unemployment rate is trending up um and the the problem with with that is that it doesn't tend to move in a linear fashion right it it goes slow and then it starts to accelerate at some point and we haven't reached the acceleration phase right so there's still a chance that we can avoid it but the longer they wait the the the riskier that's going to be I think I think there's a higher probability of a rate cut this summer than the market is giving credit for I don't think it has to happen this summer but I think the right thing to do is to cut at least 25 basis points uh this summer 50 basis points something like that just uh provide something you know are you thinking in the June meeting or July meeting I mean look last cycle I know that that the altcoin market was a lens into the consumer and I know that that when alts broke down against Bitcoin and when eth broke down against Bitcoin the FED basically cut one month later um and we we have seen eth fall against Bitcoin it had a weekly close below the June low we saw madic Bitcoin uh crash below it's June 2022 low we've seen adaa Bitcoin and Dot bit coin we've seen Litecoin Bitcoin and a Bitcoin I mean so many of these altcoins are are falling off their Bitcoin support levels and you can see it with the Bitcoin dominance so I think that the pricing out of all these rate Cuts is going to cause them to get priced in because the FED does not base their decisions on what our altcoins are doing right un they don't care what I what I what I find unfortunate is that a lot of the small like companies like Mom and Pop shops a lot of them are going out of business business right now because you know rates are going up and and and times are getting harder like inflation is so high so people just can't afford as much and but the FED has to do it because all of us Deens in the in the space can't help ourselves from bidding up jpegs you know and and and leading inflation uh to to where it was so I think that it's it's kind of a tough spot to be and the FED has to stay long enough to kind of break the animal spirits but if they do it too long then you then then you run the other issue of of a deflationary um unwind and that's not really fun either I know like people are like oh I'd love to go to the store and not spend as much money but if you if prices go down that's probably not good for risk assets terrible just yeah so everybody everybody who's watching the videos remember this when when you think like okay the Bitcoin Market or the crypto Market has to do this thing it has to do this thing because it's it's been the cycle that's always done this doesn't actually work like what we just talked about just how fragile the markets actually are and just to think how things have to really go in line before you realize that oh maybe I should have taken some profits when there was uh everything was overheated just it's just something to think about because I hate people who roundtrip and uh they really should again take some profits when everything gets too hot and and one thing just to mention about rate cuts and I mean you guys probably know this rate Cuts inherently are not bearish right it's it's the underpinning as to why they are cutting rates and you know if you actually on a granular level you go and you overlay the effective federal funds rate with you know the NASDAQ or S&P 500 markets actually tend to rally for like 30 to 60 days give or take following the First Rate cut until they wake up and they realize oh crap there's economic deterioration under the surface which is why they're cutting rates and then we see these major Corrections so I think whether the first 25 basis point comes in June or the end of July meeting or I guess hopefully September um that's probably your 30 to 60-day warning truthfully whenever it comes and I don't know when it will and what about no go ahead I was going to say you're right I mean like the rate Cuts inherently are are are bullish for risk assets if they're cutting for the right reasons in 2019 while Bitcoin topped out when rate Cuts arrived the S&P 500 kept going up and you know because the mark like the the economy was not in a recession right it wasn't going into a recession they were sort of like preliminary rate Cuts You could argue that Bitcoin is more tied to financial markets today traditional markets today than it was back then because of the spot ETF so maybe it would track the S&P 500 a bit closer than it did last cycle once rate Cuts arrive but the issue is why the FED is cutting are they cutting because they're trying to get ahead of something bad that's coming or are they cutting as a reactionary thing because they just saw a really bad labor market prance and that is is when they're not bullish like that's when rate cuts are be so it all depends on Max is right it all depends on why they're cutting and and I think that it's also risky to I I I do believe that there's just as much risk to the UPS side truthfully where you know assuming that they're going to cut because there is severe economic deterioration can also be you know a very harmful strategy long term because like you mentioned the first batch of rate cuts that we saw in 2019 um you know the S&P 500 rallied out of those cuts like 15% and then of course we had our Co nuke in March which took us below you know where that that first uh cut occurred right but you know again it's like you have to be very careful you kind of threading your own needle per se because just because they're cutting doesn't mean sell everything right because they could cut you know the labor market could be more resilient than anybody's expecting the S&P 500 could go up 50% over the next year and then something bad happens and you get a correction but that correction doesn't take you down to as low as the point in which the first cut happens so you just have to be a little bit careful truthfully you know you have to really understand why they're cutting and and it's a tough thing to do it's very tough I me with the S&P you know there there's been all sorts of like crises throughout all the decades but if you just pull up a chart over a 100 years I mean you know the the the overall trend is clear you know um the markets generally go up because the money supply yeah yeah you know why did prices of houses go up 40% because the supply of money went up 40 per. you know it's not it's not I it's not really that complicated so yeah no I mean I think like as always right like time in the market often beats time the market um because it's impossible to to actually time the market for under most circumstances and I think sometimes people get lucky with it and then assume that they're like a genius and can do it again and again and again um but the reality is that the market will humble us all at some point why don't we go ahead and wrap it up there um we we'll have NFA live back I guess next week next week I think it'll be on Rob's Channel um so we'll see you guys over there next week and again if you're not subscribed uh to to Max or Rob links for their channels are in the description below and uh we will see you guys next time

we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the having if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom the sale will be ending just after the having so make sure you check it out and lock in the lower rate let's go ahead and jump in the Bitcoin having is probably one of the most significant events in our industry I often find people debating every cycle you know whether the having is priced in or not whether it has an effect on pric or not my view is that you know we've had three having before we had one in 2012 one in 2016 and of course one in 2020 and I I certainly do think that the having does play a role in the cycles of the crypto verse um I also think that monetary policy plays a role but I don't really fall in either Camp completely I don't think that it's only based on supply side stuff and I don't think it is only based on you know monetary policy I think it's a combination of of different things markets are complex um they're they're based on a lot of different things and so because the having is one of the most important events I wanted to do a video where we talk about it and talk about where where I have previously said that theit the price of Bitcoin may be now price predictions are honestly something that I'm not super into um because usually you know usually price predictions don't really turn out that great if if you put in a price prediction and it goes above it then you know the comments aren't so nice and if you put a price prediction and we don't quite get there you know people are also upset but I wanted to to revisit something that I said four years ago and kind of see like where are we with respect to that so four years ago I put out this video Bitcoin Fair valuation at the next tabing in 2024 I put out this video in 2020 in May of 2020 the price of Bitcoin was around $8,000 and what I said back then was that if we follow the fair value logarithmic regression trend line then by the fourth having which is the having that's about to occur the price to bitcoin would be between 40 to $50,000 okay that's what I said back then clearly we are above that price right clearly if we go back and look at the video that I put out a year ago or no this was at the end of 2022 um or mid 2022 just before the the the um the final collapse occurred I also sort of Drew it out going to around a 40 to 50K so with Bitcoin right now at 63k it's ahead right I mean there's no denying it it's ahead of where I said it was going to be back then now of course back then putting out a price prediction four years later um and and hoping that it would be accurate at all was probably something I was fairly naive about uh but here we are 4 years later and the price of Bitcoin is actually above the target range that I put and it's also above this area that I put as well going into the having and so with that in mind I I want to discuss a couple of things that that may come up after the having um that could very well uh take some people by surprise now there's a lot of different thoughts to this current cycle with it being you know so hot at this point in the cycle we've never seen the market put in new highs before the having right this is the first time ever that Bitcoin has put in new highs before the having and so that was you know probably one of the reasons why back then I I didn't think it would be quite so high but we are at new highs before the having and so I just want to talk about what you know what to potentially expect after the happing now there's two different trends of thought here one of which is a left translated Peak okay now to be completely honest I'm not really in the left translated Peak camp but it does have like maybe 40% of my attention and the reason for that is if you were to take the ROI of Bitcoin from Peak to Peak and you take it from the April Peak Peak instead of the November 2021 Peak and you compare it to last cycle it sort of looks like it potentially could form into a peak sooner rather than later in which case you would get a left translated top meaning the the the actual top occurs way before anyone thinks it will historically Bitcoin has topped out in the fourth quarter of the post having year so if you look at Major Peaks that Bitcoin has had in the past if I were to get an arrow here you can see that this top was in Q4 of the post having year this one was in Q4 of the post having year and this one was in Q4 of the posst having Year we're currently in Q2 of the having year so you know that is is still about six quarters away when Bitcoin typically tops but again so far this cycle is anything but typical with Bitcoin putting in new before the having so if it is to translate into a left translated Peak a left translated cycle then it would be more likely that the top would occur in 2024 as opposed to 2025 if we are going to follow that then I have to imagine that we would follow potentially what happened last cycle now it's not really my base cas but again it would be foolish not to at least acknowledge the similarities but on the other hand where I would say 60% of my attention is right now is what if this cycle is just like prior cycles and we are all over here jumping through hoops trying to explain why this time is different when potentially it just Peaks when it normally does and one way that we could go about getting to that point would be that if we had a cool off in the summer okay now there's no guarantee and if we follow this path then you might see the exact opposite of a summer lull but if there is a summer lull then one thing to keep in mind when you look at the last two cycles as measured Peak to Peak you can see that at this point in the cycle Bitcoin was only up or it was it was actually still about 60% down from its all-time high now I want you to think about that for a minute in both prior Cycles at this point as measured Peak to Peak Bitcoin was 60% below the all-time high 60% below it now right now Bitcoin is not 60% below the prior high in fact 60% below the prior High would put Bitcoin all the way down at around $26,000 that's how accelerated we are this cycle look at the last cycle 60% down from that Peak you can see that by May of 2020 that was when the having occurred Bitcoin was down 60% from the high and then if you go back to the cycle before that this the that the having occurred in July if I remember correctly and if you go to July of 2016 you will see that Bitcoin was approximately down 60% from the high this having it's not right it's not 60% down from the high in fact it is at the high it's at the high which has never happened before so this has caused a lot of people to view this cycle as different from the prior ones and I have to tell you they make a fair point they make make a fair point and if you measure it from the April top you can kind of see that Bitcoin is doing just about what it always does at this point in the cycle if you take the April top as the more important top and of course there is evidence to suggest that the April top is the more important top for instance some of that evidence to suggest the April top is the more important top is to look at views to a lot of different cryptocurrency YouTube channels and to note that there were more views in the first half of 2021 than there were in the second half where Bitcoin basically just put in a lower high in terms of social activity but somehow a higher high in terms of price if you look at Bitcoin with respect to its 50e moving average one of the things that it does after every major cycle top is that it goes back down to the 50 we and then gets a bounce a dead cap bounce before ultimately capitulating we saw that happen over here as well go back to the 50 we get a dead bounce and then go all the way down this past cycle we did not see that exactly what happened was we went back to the 50 we and instead of it just being a dead cap bounce to a lower high which is what potentially that would have been we ended up getting a higher high which took a lot of people off guard now I was optimistic of a higher high but honestly I think because of for for wrong reasons you know and sometimes you get things right for the wrongs reasons and and it's important to take that into consideration so we can see that that happened right we can see that we went to the 50 we we got a bounce but that time it actually led to a higher high the even the intermediate bull market in 2019 had us bouncing off the 50 week at some point and so the 50 we today is at around 40K it's at 39.2k 39.3k which is interesting because again that is way below the current prices way below current prices and I have to imagine that if we do not evolve into a left translated top if we do not right so there's two op you know there's two options right we evolve into a left translated top where the peak occurs in 2024 or we evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 if we're going to evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 you really need to see Bitcoin cool off for a while and again as measured Peak to Peak you can see just how far quote unquote ahead of schedule this cycle is it's actually not that unfamiliar when you think about it the reason it seems like this time is different is because Bitcoin is at new all-time Highs but if you look at the last cycle there was a period where it too was well above its prior cycle but what eventually happened is it bled back down and basically got in line with the prior cycle and then still ended up showing diminishing returns okay and then it actually got ahead of that cycle again this is why a lot of people thought we were going to go to 300 K last cycle but it still was diminishing returns so I want to continue to put forth this idea that if we do not evolve into a left translated Peak sometime around the having and instead the market cools off going into the summer then you might just see something like this where it causes the cycle to just get back in line with prior Cycles now that of course could make a lot of people think that the cycle that the peak is over and and the Bull Run is is is completely done and and maybe they're right right but there is at least some evidence to suggest that that could be what is ultimately in store for us as we get lat into the cycle if you're not familiar with how the last cycle worked and why we what what happened when we bled back down here there's a number of things that really put Bitcoin back into a intermediate bare Market sort of you had a a quantitative tightening bull market and then a bare Market as rate Cuts arrived and then a QE bull market that topped in 2025 now take a a look at Bitcoin this cycle and see how it's doing something very very similar in the sense that it's had this major run during High interest rates you can see it's had this run during High interest rates and in fact if you were to look very closely at when the FED paused here and compare it to this you can see something very similar happened right it it fell just after the FED paused here it fell just after the FED paused and then it went up quite a lot but ultimately what happened is that it it found a local top as just before rate Cuts arrived and then it bled for a while before getting another bull run into the post having year now by the way the having is only four four days away so if we do come up and put in a new local high before the having or maybe around the having that still doesn't necessarily invalidate the idea of the market cooling off sometime after the having if the left translated Peak is not going to occur okay so again there's two thoughts you have a left translated Peak where us Deens just can't help ourselves and everyone just front run runs everything until until the consumer caves or the other idea which would support the idea of this time not being different would just for the cycle to get back in line now if the cycle gets back in line then maybe this view from four years ago of around a you know 40 to 50K Bitcoin by the fourth having isn't that far off I know right now if we were to go back to 40 to 50 okay it would probably feel like the world's falling apart for a lot of people but one thing to consider is that when when e I'm you know I don't know how I made it this far in the video without talking about it one thing to consider last cycle is that the 30% drop Bitcoin had pretty shallow drops during this QT bull market right pretty shallow drops and then eventually it finally got a 30% drop that 30% drop corresponded precisely to the point when eth Bitcoin broke down and eth Bitcoin just broke down below the summer 2022 low so if you were to get a 30% drop sometime after the having that would actually put you kind of right around that range that we said way back over here and in addition to that it would also get you Loosely backed in line with where the prior Cycles were so going into this Bitcoin having is certainly different in the sense that we've never seen a new all-time high before the habing if you were to go look at the risk metric of Bitcoin you will see that the risk on bitcoin has never been this High going into the having in fact the last time we went into the the the 20 when we went into the 2020 having the risk of Bitcoin was at 04 when you look at the 2016 having in July of 2016 the risk on bitcoin was 0.4 today the Bitcoin risk is6 so it's actually quite a bit higher than it was during the last two 3 to4 this time we find ourselves at 639 and only a few weeks ago the risk was in the 7 to8 risk band to give you an idea of what the 04 risk band would look like which is where we were going into the last two that's where the 04 to 0.5 wristband is that's where the price of Bitcoin was at the last two Habs and you can see actually that Bitcoin when those rate Cuts arrived right here had that correction back to the 100 we moving average now what's fascinating about that is that it would correspond to the prior breakout zone so I I I feel like there's two different ways that we can look at the market here here that make the most amount of sense number one is that this is not different from the prior cycles and we're kind of on track with where we should be and that could be viewed by maybe looking at the ROI after the after the low if you look at the ROI after the low and you compare this cycle with two cycles ago this is exactly where we were but you can see that it at this point it did cool off for a while and then did get a drop kind of um you know this was day 520 or so about you know a month and a half from now or so so you can view it like that or you can view it from the peak and still say we're where we should be based on uh based on measuring it from the April top right if you take this out Peak to Peak if you measure it from the April top we're pretty much where we should be but again I can't help but think are we are we are we doing the same thing again where everyone tries to come up with a reason for why this time is different but in reality it's not so my thought process on the matter is this as we go into the Bitcoin having if Bitcoin accelerates into the having and post having and into June right if it is something like that where you know over here in 2019 in fact before rate Cuts arrived it actually did rally in until June last year we had a a local top in April but then we swept the high in June if we get something like that where Bitcoin continues to go up throughout the summer then I would be more in tune with the idea of a left translated top where you get a top in 2024 as opposed to say 2025 however on the other hand if you get a low Top by Bitcoin here as rate Cuts arrive and then instead of you know and that could still include sweeping the prior high right but if you get a look kind of like we did over here with the spot ETF we we put in a new high on the day of the spot ETF for the cycle if on the other hand we see the market cool off into the summer and go to say the 04 to 0.5 wristband or even the 0. 3 to point4 wristband and we get the market more back in line with the prior two cycles then I I think that perhaps the base case should still be that the cycle is playing out just as it always has and you still could get a top in in late 2025 and in fact it was this very intermediate bare Market that kind of scared a lot of people off in fact what happens if something like that happens again where rate Cuts arrive and you go back down scares a lot of people off and then because everyone gets scared off the FED starts printing money again and then you get a QE bow Market I've said this before and I'll say it again there's two types of bull markets in crypto there's quantitative tightening bull markets that occur during periods when the FED is lowering reducing the assets on their balance sheet that's what we got in 2019 and that's what we've got over here and during those periods during those periods eth Bitcoin goes down eth Bitcoin goes down during QT quantitative tightening bull markets how many people for the last couple of years have said that eth outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market that's not true not without any disclaimer because as you can see bitcoin's been going up since late November of 2022 and eth Bitcoin has been going down the entire time so that is why I still think there is some evidence to suggest the cycle may play out like it always does rather than a left translated top I'm not completely unsympathetic to the idea of a left translated Peak there's a lot of really smart people out there that frankly provide a compelling case for it and I could honestly provide a compelling case for it I just showed you guys some of the different charts but if Bitcoin does not run into the highest wristbands the 0. N to one wristband this summer and instead it just cools off like it did back over here after the having it might scare a lot of people off but perhaps it's just doing what it did last cycle and it the only reason that the top the local the midcycle top came later was because rate Cuts came later this cycle than they did last cycle so you have quantitative tightening bull markets where Bitcoin goes up as e Bitcoin bleeds all Bitcoin pairs bleed and then you have QE bull markets that go where Bitcoin goes up as eth Bitcoin goes up so eth outperforms Bitcoin in a QE Market but not a QT Market there's two different different types of bull markets so that is a very important distinction and I think we've only received more and more evidenced over the last year that Bitcoin really is dependent somewhat on monetary policy because last September when eth Bitcoin came back down to to this area right here there were there were a lot of people that thought that it had bottomed because that's when it had bottomed in the last cycle Q3 of the pre having year this development here which is what I said was likely going to happen this development of the the devaluation of eth against Bitcoin shows that the market is very much dependent on monetary policy whether we want to believe it or not so if that is the case right if that continues to be the case then you very well could see a a repeat of what happened over here sort of an intermediate Lull in the market followed by because of rate Cuts right that occur during rate Cuts followed by the last rate cut which leads to a QE bull market where you maybe top out when you normally do in the latter part of the post tapping year so two different theories if you're new here that's what is you know has really been discussed over the last uh year or so is this cycle different is it not I honestly think if you if you have a bias on it you're going to find the evidence that you're looking for um I I think we we'll know soon enough we we'll know soon enough if Bitcoin cools off into the summer which it very well could we we've seen gold breakout just like it did in mid 2019 we've seen eth Bitcoin break down just like it did in mid 20 M mid 2019 all Bitcoin pairs still haven't broken down yet but if it cools off into the summer then it just seems like it's the same thing as last cycle it's just that the the midcycle top was nine months later about about n nine months later if on the other hand after the having Bitcoin just accelerates to the upside once again then I will have to uh I will probably say that there's more Merit to the idea of of a left translated top but that's what I'm looking at right now and so to just revisit my prediction back in 2020 what would be the fair value of Bitcoin at the fourth having of 40 to 50k I find myself today seeing a $64,000 Bitcoin 4 days before the having and I I can't think I can't help but think to myself wow back then when I made that prediction I thought it was a lofty prediction that frankly was maybe not you know not that likely to come true because you know when Bitcoin is at 8K and and it really hadn't done anything for a couple of years I wasn't really that optimistic um of of you know exactly how accurate this prediction would be come to find out I was too conservative potentially right I was too conservative so it just goes to show how difficult these markets are to predict um four years ago price of Bitcoin was at 8K I said fourth having 40 to 50 instead we find ourselves at 64 and what's fascinating to me is that if we were at 40 to 50K I think it would you know a lot of people would think the the world's falling apart when in reality that would have been what the fair value sort of suggested it would be and that chart that chart that you see in that video is just this chart right here um these regression bands here so at the last taing we were at the fair value that's the other thing that why I said 40 to 50K back then because at every prior having Bitcoin was at the fair value so in no the fit to non-bubble data so in November 2012 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to non-bubble data in July of 2016 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to quote unquote non-bubble data in May of 2020 Bitcoin was at its fair value fit to again quote unquote non bubble data theoretically I should have updated this chart because it does I think need to get updated every cycle I haven't really done it yet if I did update it it would just shift it down very very slightly but right now according to this chart the fair value is around um 52k 52k but if you if you were to refit it based on this data over here it would actually probably put the fair value somewhere between 40 to 50K which is why I said back over here like we'll have to refit it um and and it'll be around 40 to 50K so we're above that level right now if on the other side of the having or something we see that level just know that that is is is what the um you know the regression band would have ultimately suggested for this part of the cycle so those are my thoughts going into the Bitcoin having we will see what happens uh as the having comes around it's only four days away and and we will do an update in maybe a month or so we'll see what happened you know after the having if we just contined to rally on into a left translated top or if it cools off like 2019 and and we just kind of come back down and and cool off until until the last rate cut arrives if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs

know the having is is just under a day way um so why not why not do a live stream and and then talk about it trying to post this all right um so let me see if I can pull up a having countdown here's one so 23 hours 2 minutes uh looks like it'll be on April 20th uh just after um the turn of the day right so I mean if you're on eastern time in the states then it'll obviously be on April 19th if you are you know in Europe or something it'll be or Asia it'll be April 20th so I mean it really depends on on where you are uh as opposed to the date so I guess for some of us it'll be on April 19th for other people it'll be on April 20th I tend to just measure all these things by Bitcoin by UTC time you know weekly closes by the UTC time like we're looking at it Eastern right um so I mean I think it you know just saying April 20th is probably um the way to go but I'm sure some people will say April 19th especially because that's where it will happen in the um in the in the states so let's go over to to bitcoin it's currently just below 61k um I don't really have an agenda tonight to be completely honest I just thought hey why not throw in a live stream talk a little B about crypto uh you guys know my thoughts on the market obviously I've made those very clear um you know and I I do think that that gold breaking out and eth Bitcoin breaking down does have ramifications on the market and and if you look at at what has happened to altcoins ever since eth Bitcoin broke down they just can't they can't really catch a bit against Bitcoin and they just keep keep on bleeding right they just keep on bleeding uh bitcoin's kind of staying the same so far but the altcoins kind of just keep on going lower and and this is exactly what we saw just before rate Cuts last cycle as well um and so what you would look for when you do get volatile moves by Bitcoin whether to the upside or the downside it should be fairly detrimental to the altcoin market so if Bitcoin were to you know to Rally back up to the 8we SM then I imagine it would break alts down on their Bitcoin pairs if it were to drop to the bull Mark support band and then bounce or something I imagine it would break all Bitcoin pairs down as well and so that's kind of the you know sort of the The Dilemma that that altcoins find their find themselves in at the moment um but I I also think it's important to remind ourselves that even when you're in larger Trends um there can of course be counter Trend rallies right so you know even though I'm bullish on on bitcoin dominance like I have been for like two and a half years it doesn't mean you're not going to occasionally get pullbacks along the way we did see a pretty big pullback by dominance right after the spot ETF um I'm not really convinced that we have to have a big pullback by Bitcoin dominance after the having but if it does happen just know that the trend is likely still intact uh and it's so far Bitcoin dominance has been doing a really great job of just holding 55% I mean I've actually been pleasantly surprised that it's been able to it and um I I I assume it will continue to go higher as the months um continue to sort of pass Us by but let's go through if you guys have any questions we will um talk about them and Ivan says how are you doing fine at the moment um we got a lot of comments up here yeah 24 hours to go uh no I'm not going to be doing a 24-hour stream dream uh no I I won't be able to do that um I will have uh other duties to attend to I do have four young kids um so I'm not gonna I'm not going to do a 24-hour stream but maybe if I were in college I would have so hopefully there's someone out there uh that's doing the 24hour stream but it's not GNA be me um someone says Emily says hello from Central California uh hello I was actually looking at um uh the YouTube stats recently and I was looking at let me see if I can pull this up analytics audience where is it right here it is okay so here is the let me actually go to Lifetime so if you look at my lifetime and analytics uh based on age and gender you can see that 94.4% are male only 5.5% female um and statistically most of you are between the ages of 25 to 44 so if you're a male between the ages of 25 to 44 then there's you're not alone there's a lot of other other people that are that same demographic as well but it does you know it does really make you wonder like how do you actually get more uh women in crypto right I mean I have to imagine that that one thing that would be helpful would be for all the uh the the Relentless meme coin Shilling if I think that is probably not the way to to reach a lot of a lot of people but um we'll we'll see I have received some messages about that you know I think a lot of people would just prefer like you know not the whole crazy open mouth thumbnails and all that kind of stuff but but something a little bit more um realistic but yeah I mean it's interesting um and and of course most of you are at least I guess the third of Year from the United States and about 9.5 from the UK five and a half from Australia 5.4 from Canada and 4.3% from the uh Netherlands so Netherlands is representing some there um let's go back over to bitcoin we're we're currently around 61k um someone says uh why are we dumping you know I've talked a lot about how you know I mean look guys you there could always be a a bounce after the having or something but you know there is a lot to be said in terms of um you know just kind of being ahead of where we normally are at this point in the cycle and I again I know it's not cool to point that stuff out but know we saw the same thing happened last cycle we got really far ahead and then we we basically spent 9 months cooling off to get back in l so I don't know if that's going to happen again um it probably depends on on you know monetary policy as well but just something to keep in mind right something to just like kind of keep in the back of your head that that could play out and it wouldn't necessarily mean anything um same thing happened last cycle I think that you know when you get into a period where it's essentially up only for a while um any type of move to the downside just seems like unbearable but I mean you can see where we are um at this point in the last two cycles we were still 50 to 60% below the all-time highs so um it's it's not I mean it's not that crazy diminishing returns I do think we'll have diminishing returns again this cycle um you know whether it's a left translated cycle Peak or not uh whether you get a peak in 2025 or 2024 um yeah I mean just depends on on a lot of different things and how how everything uh plays out check markets gold oil pumping hard on the war news um yeah I mean Gold's now at 2400 but I I would say I mean you know there gold has has been building up to this for a long time and and now it's broken out so yeah yes of course we're going to find reasons I mean you know back in 2022 when you had the whole like you know Russia Ukraine situation we saw gold go up and and we that's still ongoing by the way and it still came back down right um so you know I mean you have to think about that too right like that is is something to consider because um yeah I mean like if it if if we were just going down here we'd find a narrative to support it so yes I mean you can we can always say there's a reason for it but there's also been um stuff like that in the past and you know but I think you know we saw gold building up here it made sense for it to break out I've said for a long time it's going to break out and when it does it's a risk-off signal for the cryptoverse and you know that was met with a lot of uh criticism of course but here we are and gold broke out e Bitcoin broke down and the cryptoverse is is stuck in traffic on struggle Street right now uh thanks for all the content knowled J sure um someone says green candle in today April 20th my my guess there's GNA be a lot of volatility tomorrow which probably means we're not going to do anything but if I had to guess I would say there's going to be a lot of volatility tomorrow um as the having I I guess the issue is that really it would be on Saturday if it's UTC time so technically it wouldn't even be tomorrow because you know it' be on Saturday UTC but I I suspect that you know going into the having and just after the having there's going to be a lot of volatility um and you know you could make a case either way um you know you know if you look at the first if you look at other local tops and you kind of see like what happened going into them um and and by the way I mean it could be more significant than just a local top I mean I I don't want to imply that it can't be it it very well could be and I I've said before that it could very well be something like that um but you know in a lot of these times like kind of we've seen the market just sort of slowly bleed back down at these tops you got these rallies back up to the 8we SMA after getting a few week moov to the downside but in 2020 late 2021 we basically just went back down um you know pretty far in fact kind of back down to this level here which is where this base would be and that's that's pretty that's pretty far down so I really don't know I mean I really don't know which way it's going to break but um I I hopefully hopefully you have a plan you know hopefully you have a plan uh to navigate it um my my guess is whatever happens all Bitcoin pairs are going to are going to go down a lot is is what I would suspect over the next couple of months can I talk a little bit about Bitcoin duts um I mean you guys know my my thoughts I'm guessing you're being sarcastic but I I I just suspect it's going to go to 60% this summer that's my view I just think 60% is likely going to happen this summer and and I I just hope people are prepared for it um I I feel like I've done the best I can to try to prepare people I think too like at this point I've either sold you on the idea or I haven't and so it almost seems like like kind of useless to make you know keep making one hour long dominance videos it's like you either buy it or you don't right you either buy the idea or you don't and at this point you know with it being at 55% 55 and a half percent and already went to 57% you know I I do think it could top out right in the 60s not too far from here and so you have to be I have to be careful because I don't want everyone to you know finally believe it R when it actually finally hits the top I mean I this is why I've been bullish on dominance since 38% um I do think you know a good part of the move is behind us for dominance but I I still think there's a little bit more to go in it so yeah I mean we'll see we'll see what happens um in the next couple of weeks for Bitcoin uh whether it gets the move back to the 8-week estimate or not again example here where you go back up to it example here um in 2019 where where you go back up to it you above it right above it in those two cases and then an example here where you you went back up to it but it it took it a little bit longer right I mean like you know we we had a little bit of pullback and then the third candle here which is the one we're currently in was a pretty big move to the downside where it actually you know went down to that Wick right there right it went down pretty far so you know whatever happens my guess is sometime in May um you you know you or maybe June but you would get back up and it could even be like the next couple of weeks if it if it resolves like this right here but even that could still end up being May um that you go back up to the8 week but again you know if it if you get a larger move down first that move back up to the 8 week might not be as impressive because in the eight-week estimate would have come down quite a bit yeah I I know I'm not really looking at the news but I I don't really talk about the news on here but um yeah I don't know I mean I I will leave the news to you guys what's a good question to ask I don't know someone says once the Bitcoin race becomes the space race of the sah alts will a blip in the history in the history books I do think that like you can make money on alts because there is alt season like once every four years or so but I I think it is true that most alts will just bleed back to bitcoin over the longer Hall and so you are better off just kind of if you are in the altcoin market occasionally taking profits back to bitcoin just so you lock those profits in um if you're if bitcoin's sort of your unit of account right so you know if you don't really want to use the US dollar as your unit of account and you just want to treat one Bitcoin as one Bitcoin and say I don't really care what USD valuation is worth because even if it goes down it'll probably recover eventually then yeah I mean like I I I do think it makes sense to to value your portfolio in SATs and not US Dollars and I know like when you're going through your first cycle that seems insane right I mean like it seems insane but by your second cycle and your third cycle you really start to understand like why you you value your portfolio and Satoshi over over you know US dollars because it's all about preserving the Satoshi valuation of your portfolio and a lot of those all just go to zero um again like some of them won't I mean some of them will will likely you know survive obviously I think ethereum Will Will Survive but you really have to be careful I mean you do and I I know like people are like well whatever but you know you find yourself again where a lot of the alts are are not even really that far off of I mean they're just putting in new lows against Bitcoin right I mean a lot of these alts are putting in new lows against Bitcoin and so um there really wasn't a great time to be in that altcoin over the last three years right I mean like look at eth Bitcoin it's been in a downtrend since December of 2021 right I mean there hasn't really been a great period to buy eth over Bitcoin and hold it for a year you know I mean or for a couple years maybe if you cherry pick this low here you could find an instance but I mean for the most part it's just been bleeding um the same goes with with a lot of with a lot of all coins so you have to be I mean you certainly have to be careful with them someone says hello from Singapore can you talk about alt season in 2017 and monetary policy at the time well in 2017 the FED had been raising rates for a little while but the main difference is that rates were relatively low right so it's not like it was a super aggressive rate hiking cycle like we've seen this time um I mean a lot of these bull markets are basically just the market kind of like adjusting to higher interest rates and seeing if it can handle it and when it does the market goes higher and then eventually it can't and then and then the market caves but yeah I mean you had an altseason um you know over here I mean rates were really low they were only like one and a half percent so technically they were going up but they weren't really that High I mean you know the cost of capital was still relatively cheap and so that's why I mean I I I don't think it it it was as bad but once you got you know to to one and a half 2% then you can see what what ultimately happened to the crypto Market it's more like the rate of change I think than anything else this is a pretty big rate of change but um please talk about a scenario where the FED doesn't cut rates until 2025 so I do think they will cut to be clear but the market is saying only one cut in 2024 and then one cut all the way out till April of 2025 that's what the market thinks right now my suspicion as I've said is that the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in um because once and the reason if you think about it like why that would be the case if you if you see rate Cuts get priced out then businesses are starting to actually going to believe that the FED means what they say and they're going to go higher for longer if businesses believe it then they're going to change their spending you know they the type of spending they're going to cut costs they're going to lay people off right if they just think that rate cuts are just not really ever going to come anytime soon and so just the market believing that rate cuts are not coming will probably cause them to to actually come quicker um on a day like today obviously a lot of people think there's only going to be one cut this year I suspect you could get multiple Cuts this year and I think it's possible to get a cut this summer you know um so yeah I do think that it is possible even though I know the market is not really calling for a cut until um September at the current time someone says hello from Tasmania wow they going from uh California do I think salana will overtake eth uh no I don't um if you look at the sole eth valuation I mean it it it sort of looks like it's you know at the top of the range here right if it's an oscillator um so so these are these are sort of natural questions that come up about altcoins when they've rallied against eth or Bitcoin for a while is you know do you think you're going to overtake them a lot of times those questions come up at range highs right so um just the fact that you're asking that you know and I know I know I've looked at the soulle E valuation for a while here um but you have to be careful with that sort of stuff because a lot of people will think that especially when you're near the range Heights and then and then it just ends up being no different than than before someone says TLT spiked um yeah so so so bonds are a way to hedge uh certainly if you if you want to be um if you want to hedge it is in fact dubious speculation can I talk about plan B's prediction um yeah I mean I I really don't think bitcoin's going to go to 300K um I I do think eventually it will but I don't I don't think it's going to go there this cycle um I mean we we we basically had the same disagreement last cycle too I mean like I I was um more conservative he was more optimistic um but with that said you know I I also would argue that he's had a lot of great predictions a lot of things have worked out so just because I don't agree with it doesn't mean it's not going to happen I just think that you're you're you're probably not going to go to 300K that would be basically like a 5x from Peak to Peak and last cycle we only did like a three you know a three and a half X from Peak to Peak so I just I I don't think you're going to see that happen this cycle but I do think it is I think it's attainable in future Cycles um but I I don't think it's going to happen this cycle someone says they're female I got into crypto because I wanted to learn about it now as compared to when I made you with diena no I think it's great to learn about I mean I think it's great to learn about oh we got someone from Brazil someone says I think that women are by Nature more risk averse yeah I feel like a lot of times yeah like the um you'll see more guys take on a lot more risk and and you know like sometimes it works and then sometimes it really doesn't work trying to find more questions but you guys are all just saying the same thing you're talking about geopolitical stuff which I don't really want to get into um and I think the issue is that you know we always find a reason you know we always find a reason but um I mean remember I mean like eth eth saw a top before the merge a month before the merge and the reason why I've said before that we have to be careful with this one was because it was a month before the having and also um you know this FIB retracement kind of shows that would be an area that would be potentially difficult to get through and it it is proving difficult to get through right and if you look at this you know we're sort of falling below the below the 3618 the 2618 is all the way down to like 47k right I mean that that would actually be below the bull market support band um so if you were to go there it would basically be sort of a crash below the 20we SMA um I I don't know if that's going to happen or not I mean I I do suspect that Bitcoin will go below the 20we ese this year but I don't know if it's going to happen like immediately or if it's going to be like a 2019 style thing where we chop around for a few months and then go below it someone says diminished interest it's really interesting because think about this guys we are a day away from the having and the social risk is 0.1 no one cares like like no one cares and that's why I I think we're more similar to this phase before rate Cuts than we are to sort of this uptrend over here where we're putting in higher lows the social risk just put in a lower low which is more similar to what we saw back over here in kind of the 2019 phase so I think that is ultimately where we are right now in the cycle is just before those rate Cuts arrive and and people are losing interest not because they don't like crypto but it's just that they're struggling right they're struggling with uh with with with finances maybe they're worried about their job you know inflation is brutal and this is why if you look at prior Market Cycles with you know traditional markets this is why inflationary periods are just so brutal in the markets because because you know the consumer struggles with all these higher prices for everything they have less disposable income but you know I kind of just think we're in this phase right here where social interest is just really really low um and could stay that way I mean honestly it could stay that way for you know the rest of the year frankly at least through the summer but yeah I wouldn't be surprised to see it the social risk you know stay in the in this lower area for a few months maybe bounce back and forth a little bit but um I wouldn't be surprised to see that but you're right I mean the social interest is is really has really Fallen um even though the having is only one day away if you look at YouTube views for a lot of these different crypto YouTube channels um you know they were basically at two million just a month ago month and a half ago and now they're down to one million across all these different crypto YouTube channels so definitely a lot of interest has been lost in the crypto verus recently which again is why as social interest goes down Bitcoin dominance goes up right we've talked about that a lot um and you can see it right I mean here's Bitcoin dominance without Stables as social interest goes down Bitcoin dominance goes up because if if you need if you want to see altseason you need a lot of new retail investors coming into the space to frankly buy your bags right but if they're not coming into the space and there's just not a lot of interest then the altcoin market keeps on bleeding against Bitcoin when Bitcoin dominance tops out what do you chart your alts against I think it still makes sense to chart them against Bitcoin if you want to chart them against eth as well I think that makes sense I wouldn't Char them against really anything else uh not like you know not Ono I mean I think Bitcoin and E make the most amount of sense if you want to compare altcoin valuations to other altcoin valuations you can do that but I I don't think it's as relevant gold running at this particular time versus Bitcoin is undeniably about look I I think it really is what we saw like last cycle it's you know gold broke out and and when it breaks out risk assets falter was the same thing you know it's the same it's legitimately the same thing we saw last cycle and I just feel like so many people don't want to believe it because of the having but what about the merge with eth I mean everyone told me after the merge eth Bitcoin was going to go up and look it it has only gone down as we said it was likely going to do um you have to be careful you have to be careful with the narratives it's more so what are the charts saying and what the charts are saying is that gold is broken out and that eth Bitcoin is broken down and I said for years that when e Bitcoin breaks down that's when the cryptoverse will struggle because it will represent a source of liquidity drying up right and now now that you got your first weekly close below the the the range low there you can kind of see just how how much the altcoin market has struggled on their on their Bitcoin pairs someone says the Head and Shoulder Target on gold as likely is 2500 I don't know anything think about the uh the whole inverse head and should I've said before I think we should leave The Head and Shoulder stuff to shampoo companies but I think that you know 2500 is is definitely a realistic Target I wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback from there but it's one of those things where like you know you spend three years waiting for it to break out and then it breaks out and then everyone's waiting for the pullback and you just don't get one right so I I do think if there is a pullback by gold then it probably would just be a um you know an opportunity do you think it's going to go higher for several years like it's not you know when gold breaks out it doesn't just break out um and then in the move immediately it usually breaks out and and has a a pretty impressive move that that lasts for a while so my guess this is going to last for a while um you can still get pullbacks like this like happened after it broke out in 2008 um where it broke out and then it actually had a pretty massive pullback but even in that situation it was a lot quicker to recover than you know than than risk ass that's it was a hedge right it's a hedge someone says when is a good time to accumulate alts um I I I I I mean look it's up to you it's really up to you I I don't think alts Mak sense because I just think dominance of bitcoin's going to go up you know so if you want exposure to crypto I think you're better off with Bitcoin uh with that said Bitcoin risk is still relatively high right now um as I mentioned I try to be as transparent as possible uh with with Bitcoin and what I'm doing um maybe not as possible because I mean I do Focus some of that on ITC premium but if you look at the risk levels you know as you go up the risk levels I I think the idea is as I've said to dynamically DCA out because you never really know um where the Top's going to be the local top you don't know if you're going to go to the highest risk band or if you're going to top out somewhere in between so by taking some profits along the way it it tends to work out um that way you know you take some off the table in case the market nukes uh but you still have some in case you know in case the market keeps going up so far we've seen a lot of like 20 to 22% Corrections over the last year and a half or so so far this is about 18 and a half percent so a 20% correction would put it around 59k a 22% correction we put around 57k so that would be an important level to watch the reaction from because if it reacts like it normally does from that level then you would expect at least some type of relief if you don't get a reaction from that level then it might mean the market is changing remember remember it was actually when all Bitcoin pairs broke down and E Bitcoin broke down over here that Bitcoin finally got a larger correction um right now while eth Bitcoin broke down alt Bitcoin pairs haven't broken down but they can also break down very quickly we saw how much they Wicked in just a single day not too long ago so I mean you know you could find yourself tomorrow where all Bitcoin pairs are are below 04 um so it certainly is possible and I I really do hope my my my goal my focus has been to help people realize that alts are incredibly risky and and and you know Bitcoin exposure can give you exposure to the upside but if if Bitcoin drops 30 40% the altcoin market gets annihilated um and if the altcoin market doesn't get annihilated it's only because Bitcoin went up right so if you just I mean bitcoin's kind of gives you that exposure um I also think having some cash can make some sense here as I've noted especially if you dynamically DCA sold in the point 7 a point8 wristband um but you know you know I'm not asking you to like go sell everything or anything like that I just think that you know you want to make sure you manage your risk um you want to make sure you're preserving the Satoshi valuation of your portfolio and the way that you do that is by not being needy in the altcoin market when you're on the verge of rate Cuts because when the verge of rate Cuts happened last cycle we saw after eth Bitcoin broke down I put about a tweet about this and I did a whole video on it right I said last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down the altcoin market dropped like 70% now maybe this time is different but I'm just telling you that was my experience last cycle right my experience last cycle was eth Bitcoin broke down and then alts basically just slowly bled for like nine months six to nine months right if you exclude the pandemic six months right it was brutal right it was just brutal because it was like there was no end in sight it felt like it was never going to end um I mean you can see a lot of these alts are are are you know just sort of slowly leading back to bitcoin so that was kind of the sort of the purpose of all these dominance videos to help people recognize that that Bitcoin uh does provide relative safety over altcoins um and that even you know if Bitcoin were to get a big drop from here it's still well off the lows whereas the altcoin market really isn't that far off the lows you know I mean like it's really not you know in fact most of them didn't even put in new all-time highs even salana which rallied a lot didn't put in new all-time highs card is nowhere close xrp do I mean a lot of these coins are nowhere close to their all-time high so if Bitcoin gets a correction where do you think the altcoin goes right I mean it potentially goes to a lower low that's what happened last cycle I know people just blame it on on everything but we always find an excuse every cycle for why it happened um and so I I think that just kind of sticking you know with a certain strategy for me it's just been Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio and then have some cash and fixed income accounts earning interest and then use that to navigate crypto right so if you get dips you can use um you know if you get big drops back to below 04 risk or whatever your risk tolerance is my risk tolerance is 04 but if you get big drops to your risk levels that you're comfortable buying at then you have some cash you have some cash flow to take advantage of that uh but you also have Bitcoin to give you exposure to the upside I mean even even here bitcoin's up 4X off the lows how did I get the conviction for your calls in the face of haters I I think it was I mean with with with all it was just like I've seen it before like I I remember last cycle dcing altcoins like from Q3 of the bare Market year through the H through the early part of the having year and then most altcoins put in new lows in the having year and I was just like hell I could have just stuck with Bitcoin that whole time and been so much better better off you know so I was like next cycle I'm going to do it differently after the top is in I'm just going to preach the good talk about Bitcoin dominance and get people to realize that altcoins are really you know alt season only comes after we go back to you know a lot looser monetary policy and QE right that's when alt season comes back and ALT season comes back when the haters give up right that's when it comes back know you can you call It All season all you want to I don't really care what you call it but you know as far as I'm concerned you know look at the chart you know show me where alt season was over the last three years you know and in the Bitcoin dominance St show me where all season was I don't see it I mean is this is this your all season right I mean is that is that your All Season no these are all seasons right that's what you're looking for we're not there right we're not there the only way you get to all season is for dominance to go higher first right and then once it's higher and all the Deens give up then you get all season but as long as the Deens don't give up guess what they keep on spending you know like crazy and inflation is still an issue and the FED has to go higher for longer right once you break the animal spirits inflation finally comes back down the FED pivots and then Bitcoin dominance goes down but I just I don't think we're there yet right I don't I I think that Bitcoin dominance is going to go to 60% where is the 8we I think it's at like 67 um but I mean it's going to move down quickly because the the price is going down quickly so I mean like you know it's at like 66.8k right now but you know I mean because that the price of Bitcoin has moved down so much in a very short period of time you will see it sort of roll over in the coming weeks and start to back down unless we go right back up someone says they need a Bitcoin only portfolio tracker you know there there's a lot of the portfolio trackers if you look will have a little button that you can click that'll convert it from usdt or USD to to bitcoin right so there are a lot of trackers that do that you just have to maybe hit the toggle the button that has your USD valuation of your portfolio if you click it um some of them have the option to view it on on your Bitcoin valuation and some even have it so you can view it as your eth valuation um so maybe maybe the portfolio tracker that you use already has that feature and you're just not aware of it because plenty of them have the feature if you're using one that doesn't have the feature then uh I don't know what that portfolio tracker is doing but they need to start implementing it after the having what is the narrative I think the narrative after the having is just win rate Cuts is I think that's the H I think that's the narrative it's just the market screaming at the FED to give us rate Cuts is is what I would guess the next narrative is going to be fed said no maybe no rate Heights until 2025 yeah again I I I think the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in so because because the consumer gives up the you know the the businesses give up I think them saying that and the market finally believ leing higher for longer means that it's started it's it's probably time to start fading higher for longer I've been a big proponent of higher for longer forever you know I was in 2022 I said we're likely going to go five and a half percent for the terminal rate and most people were saying we weren't going to go past three and a half percent but now that we're at five and a half percent and we've been here for you know nine months or so remember the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and we're already beyond that I think that in the same way the market underestimated how High the terminal rate was going to be I think they're underestimating the number of rate Cuts we're going to get over the next year they're currently only pricing in two rate Cuts over the next year that's an issue right that's an issue and you can see what's happening markets are are rolling over and it's not just crypto you know you can see a lot of uh a lot of um equities rolling over too so you know I think it's a problem when all these rate cuts a lot of these rate Cuts get priced out and it's because they're getting priced out which my guess in not too long from now we're going to see a lot of them get priced back in so I would fade this honestly I would fade this I mean it could mean a lot of different things it could mean locking in you know certain uh fixed income type stuff it could mean getting some Hedges as I've said before like gold and and and and bonds um but I mean you know with with things like bonds I mean they can still go down if if um if we keep getting in you know hot inflation prints it's not like they have to have bottomed already it's possible they have but it's not it's not like they have to um and and also my guess is that this summer if Bitcoin dominance is at 60% I I think a lot of people will start to call for it to go much higher but if if we're getting rate Cuts uh this summer then you know might not go much higher after that right I mean what would be the that would be the perfect narrative for people to say oh well you know you're never gonna have an allseason again because of of um you know everything's just going to go into the spot ETF but I I do think what we first 60% then we talk that's kind of where I am 60% dominance then we talk someone says that's a nice white T-shirt uh this is the uh the dubious speculation t-shirt we have them in the store stored out into the cryptoverse decom I have no clue in hell why you would buy one uh but if you need a shirt you can go buy one is the cryptoverse still on discount yeah just for the next day after the having we're going to raise the prices of ITC premium so you can lock in the price between now and then if you want lower price they're going to go up quite a bit if e Bitcoin continues to fall into June as you predict well you didn't start buying alts or stay Bitcoin heavy until Qi so here's the issue with it is that alt Bitcoin pairs bottom before alt USD pairs if you have a problem with that statement look at what happened last cycle okay alt Bitcoin pairs bottom before alt USD pairs so in order to figure out when all USD pairs bottom first all all Bitcoin pairs generally have to bottom now that doesn't mean that all altcoins have to put in new lows but you know in terms of building off of a low that can then start durly outperforming Bitcoin first all Bitcoin pairs bottom then alt USD pairs bottom so I think after all Bitcoin pairs find their low then you have to wait a while after that for all USD pairs to find their low um so you know I don't you know if you convert Bitcoin to altcoins you know when Bitcoin dominance tops you might be preserving the satos valuation of your portfolio if Bitcoin dominance is topping out but then the issue could be that your USD valuation of your portfolio is going down because while all Bitcoin pairs might be going up they might be going down on their USD pairs because bitcoin's going down right so the altcoin market is really a slave to bitcoin during this phase of the cycle and that's why I've said forever right just have Bitcoin if you want exposure to crypto because you know I mean you know if Bitcoin goes up it's going to go up more than Al and if it goes down it's going to go down less than alts generally speaking some are going to break that rule but generally speaking um and as far as eth I I've said before I do think it's going to fall back through this wedge because that's exactly what it did last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down right we had this wedge and and it fell back through it as eth Bitcoin broke down and we just saw eth Bitcoin break down last week and it seems to me like you know it's falling it's potentially falling through this wedge right you can see right here it fell through the wedge after eth Bitcoin broke down here and then eth Bitcoin just broke down and it looks like ethusd is falling back through back to that wedge which is around 2200 or so um but you know my guess is that is that eus will you know will go go there this summer is my guess I mean if not sooner but I I do think that if you just look at last cycle I know everyone wants to compare this year to other having years but I'm telling you monetary policy plays a role and if you didn't believe me last year you should believe me this year because Bitcoin dominance kept going up you know most of the people that refuted the idea of monetary policy playing a big role thought the Bitcoin dominance had topped out they should go back to the drawing board now that Bitcoin dominance put in a higher high right it means they were wrong it means they were wrong so I I think it it makes sense to compare it to mon you know use monetary policy to guide the view of the uh of the cryptoverse someone says the S&P futures are under 5,000 um yeah looks like you're right it looks like we are at a that's a pretty big drop this week 40 uh 4970 how will Bitcoin cycle correspond to the S&P cycle if it is left translated um I mean I imagine if Bitcoin cycle is left translated then it probably means that the S&P is also uh topping out sooner as well um there's also a scenario where the tops already in I mean it's not necessarily you know something that I'm saying has to be the base case I think there's you know compelling reason to believe that if if the FED pivots later this year and they start printing again then we could go back up in 2025 but if they don't if they really don't cut rates until 2025 like you know one of the one of one of them said uh then you know there does exist that scenario that you have to that you have to consider right I mean you know I mean we've seen we've seen markets find local tops in election years in in in March of 2000 actually uh the S&P found a local top or a macro top for a while and um in the 70s it was in December and then in in the first in the first big inflationary cycle and then in the 1940s the uh the election near top occurred in the summer so there's a lot of different periods of high inflation um where the markets are just Manic and and inflation is running rampant where you do see some tops in in election years but also note that there is actually seasonal weakness in the S&P 500 around this time in election years right so it's not even it's not even clearcut uh if you were to look at say you know the S&P 500 um and you compare say 2024 with the average of election years I mean you can kind of see that it's actually still well above the average of where it normally is in election years right so I mean there's there's some seasonality you can see here a lot of times the S&P kind of goes below its yearly open on the average as you get out into the May time frame um or you know may to June time frame so that's pretty standard um I mean you can see just how more volatile this one has been than sort of the average if you look at 2020 obviously that was a crazy one to compare to um and I'm not asking you to you know put a lot of faith in that one but you know you can look at 2016 and see that this is this one is currently outperforming that one you can look at 2012 actually 2012 at this point was actually doing better than this year has been but you can also see that this is kind of the phase where it it it you know sort of fell back down until maybe like May June time frame uh you can look at 2008 obviously 2008 wasn't really a great year uh 2004 here's 2000 and so on and so forth do I think the Bitcoin having will slowly Drive price up I think we are really far ahead of schedule this cycle and I think we really need the market to cool off I think that would actually be really healthy if it could if it doesn't if if all the animal spirits continue to run wild then we probably um you know then you get a blowoff top that is you know uh left translated and can be really bad for the longer term um I I hope I hope the market cools off uh if like kind of like last cycle where all Bitcoin pairs have an opportunity to bottom out um but I just I don't I don't think they bottomed out yet I do think all Bitcoin pairs are going to go down do you think the Bitcoin will hit the middle or high into of the logiic aggression rainbow chart well we've already gone down two and a half log lines right I mean we already done it um so we've kind of already hit it I think we could hit it again maybe later the cycle kind of like we hit it a couple times last cycle but the two and a half log line rule has already been hit here can I explain what Bitcoin dominance is basically it's just the uh the you know the the market share of Bitcoin with respect to the entire asset class right so like if Bitcoin dominance is at 50% it means that bitcoin's market cap is half of the total market cap of the entire asset space of the entire asset class what all coins do I I haven't been buying alts I mean I I've said for a long time I I think uh you know Bitcoin makes more sense at this phase of the cycle if rate Cuts does Bitcoin go up or down it depends on why rate Cuts if you look at history there's examples where rate Cuts cause Asset Risk assets to go up and examples where risk assets go down and it's because it's why they're cutting if they're cutting to kind of get a head of any potential bad stuff then risk assets can go up in 2019 while Bitcoin went up when they cut rates um or sorry Bitcoin went down when they cut rates the S&P went up um but there are times in history where the S&P goes down when they cut rates if they're cutting rates because they get some type of really bad labor market print or something then they cut rates for the wrong you know because they waited too long and then the market goes down so it depends on why they cut there's not like a an answer that that is going to be fitting for you it's not like I can just unilaterally say that risk assets do X or Y when rate Cuts arrive it really depends on the specific situation because you can find examples of both if e Bitcoin falls into lower regression ban then ALS will fall um yeah someone says greetings from Mexico City someone from Brazil too if eth Bitcoin pair plays out as you were saying well all season come at all or it'll be a very shortlived all cycle so if it plays out like last cycle right which is a big F but if it does it means that the alt season that you're wanting is not coming this year if that if it plays out like last cycle if it doesn't play out like last cycle then maybe all maybe the alt season does come this year but if it plays out like last cycle where once rate Cuts arrive the market bleeds for like six to n months then it it means that um the market gets really boring you know and and then in 2025 maybe when everyone's given up then you get alt season um but yeah I mean I I I think it's possible that you still get alt season in terms of like Bitcoin dominance crashing but I don't think Bitcoin dominance is going to crash until you get until you see it at least at 60% and even then it's probably gota kind of move around you know from 60 to 61 or to 58 right it's got to bounce around for some months there before you see it come back down anyways oh I got someone from Africa how many to reach 800,000 subscribers that's a good question um let me go check I'm at 799,000 1857 subscribers so if 143 of you could hit that subscribe button I will be at 800,000 subscribers I would very much appreciate it uh if you could subscribe if you're not already Subs got someone from Argentina um so glad you finally can to out of Al in 2023 I was a late yeah no I mean look some alts did okay it's not like all alts have been terrible but most of them have just bled to bitcoin right and you know I think that the the the collapse of eth Bitcoin is a really bad element for the altcoin market and I know it's easy to make fun of me for it and say you know you don't know what you're talking about but it's just what happened last cycle I I don't have to be right about it I could be wrong but it's just sort of a fair warning last cycle when e Bitcoin broke alts dropped 70% right that's what happened I didn't control it right that's just what happened um so I don't know like I don't know if they're going to do the same thing but I'm not putting my money I'm not risking my money on alts if you know during during during a do during a Bitcoin dominance rally uh you're free to risk your money on alts if you want to but I'm not going to risk my money on them um I've also missed out on some pretty cool gains in the altcoin market that's a fact too you know there's definitely some altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin um let's be real right I'm not trying to pretend like you know you know it was the perfect idea not to have any alls but I mean I'm just saying for me real relatively risk averse if you see a Bitcoin dominance rally coming from a mile away which is what I thought I saw and I was right like why would I go put a lot of money in alts if I just think Bitcoin dominance is going to go up right um just ride that Bitcoin dominance wave you know let the altcoin market bleed to bitcoin and then your purchasing power to buy Alt with Bitcoin goes up right even if Bitcoin goes back down like think about it like think about it like this today let's go maybe this is a great a good way to explain it so today if you look at one over eth Bitcoin one Bitcoin will get you about 21 eth right in in MA in in um December 2021 when Bitcoin got you about 11 e right if you had if you bought Bitcoin at the top in 2021 and R and rode through the highs and the lows the your USD valuation is essentially the same but guess what you can now buy twice as much eth with the Bitcoin that you have that's why Bitcoin dominance matters is because you took on less risk to hold a safer asset Bitcoin and now you can buy an altcoin for a lot cheaper and if Bitcoin were to go down to 50K or 40K even you know even if it goes lower right 30k in 2019 it first went to the 100 we SMA when rate Cuts arrived right I mean so I mean if it if it does that it could it could take a long time for us to get there but that's where it ultimately went you know I mean it went to the 100 we moving average um right now that 100 we SMA it happens to actually correspond to that breakout point right I mean it's kind of uh coincidental but that's actually what it corresponds to so you know if you get a situation where Bitcoin crashes Bitcoin dominance likely still goes up and so then like you might be upset that your Bitcoin USD valuation is down but then maybe your Bitcoin will then fetch you 30 e right you see what I'm saying it it really depend it comes back to whether you believe in the future of the cryptoverse right if you believe in the future your of the cryptoverse then you know for satoshi's sake value your portfolio in satoshi's if you don't believe in the future of the cryptoverse then fine value your portfolio in USD but don't come crying to me if your altcoin bleeds 90% against Bitcoin over the next 10 years or probably more the satos evaluation is what is important and you know it is you can laugh we but it is that that is what matters is sat valuation it shows you just how easy it is and it's not just you know look at look at Ada Bitcoin you know look at look at one over Ada Bitcoin in 2021 one Bitcoin would get you about 15,000 Ada today it gets you 141,000 Ada all you had to do was stick with Bitcoin once the FED made it clear they were going to be raising rates and going to quantitative tightening you didn't have to have any clue where the USD valuation is going to go by the way none of us have a clue you didn't have to have any clue where the USD valuation of Bitcoin is going to go all you had to say was look we're going into a high interest trade environment the fed's going to be reducing the size of their balance sheet Bitcoin is a safer asset there's going to be a hell of a lot of Regulation risk coming for the altcoin market so I'm just going to ride that Bitcoin dominance wave convert all to bitcoin and wait until the FED pivots that's all you had to do and then one Bitcoin over here got you 16 you know 14,000 or sorry 16,000 Ada today it gets you 141,000 Ada and I don't know I mean I don't know which alt coins are going to become relics but guess what if you held Ada all the way down then you're sure as hell invested and you hope it goes back to a new alltime high if you just converted your altcoins to Bitcoin in early 2022 when I said was the time to do it you have the luxury to just kind of come in at some point in the future and just kind of scoop up whatever altcoins you want at much cheaper Bitcoin valuations right that's why I say don't marry an altcoin right don't marry an altcoin there's only one year of the cycle where it really makes sense to to to to be heavier really heavy into alts there's really like one year of the cycle where that that makes sense you you spend one year Watching Bitcoin dominance go down and then then you spend like three years watching it go up right it's not that complicated guys it's really not in fact look at this chart if this chart I was looking at this earlier it should convince you well maybe not it's dubious but look at this chart six-month East Bitcoin candle right look at this and tell me tell me everyone on here is not just over complicating the Everlasting you know what out of it green red green red red red green red green red red red you know I mean what's so hard about that right this is what happened last cycle I don't know why people thought this time was different it's possible that eth Bitcoin Bottoms in Q2 or Q3 I said before it might bottom in June that's kind of like my base case right now is that it Bottoms in June but that's going to be predicated on the idea that the FED pivots this summer If the Fed doesn't pivot this summer I think they're making a bad a really bad mistake honestly and you know I do think there's a good chance we get a hard Landing but if they don't pivot this summer I I think a hard Landing is probably locked in um because the the consumer is is starting to falter here um just because you have some residual inflation based on lagging data uh it doesn't mean I mean it doesn't mean that the consumer is healthy right but I mean look at that look at the E Bitcoin six-month candles red green red or green red green red red red same thing green red green red red red I mean it's the same exact thing for anyone who cared to look at the damn chart you know but instead I spent the last two and a half years listening to the eth Maxis tell me how it was holding up well every step of the way down and now some of them are starting to capitulate and I'm telling you I'm telling you some of them I think are going to be capitulating into that 0.3 to 0.4 range and that could be the bottom right when they say all right Ben you were right like all right well now that you believe me it's time to go back the other way so you have to you have to be careful with this stuff it's playing out like like it played out last cycle for anyone who actually cares to look at the chart and and and they don't come on here here and tell me that you know I'm ignoring all these higher lows on the E Bitcoin pair because I'm not you know I'm not I I recognize there's higher lows on here but you know what else I recognize I recognize lower highs you know so don't don't just look at at at one of the charts look at all of them right I mean you can see that like however you want to draw this out there e Bitcoin is breaking down you know um and you have to be careful when that stuff happens and I mean you know I think it I think it's going to accelerate the breakdown into the summer months and then hopefully bottom out this summer just like it did on the similar time frame in the last cycle when you looked at those six-month candles someone says chain link early M last cycle the issue with chain link you know I I with the Bitcoin valuation look to see what it does here you know I drew this potentially out um a while back you know when it was back up here look to see if it holds here at um at 17700 STS that prior low sort of that back testing that that trend line if it can hold there then maybe you have something right if it can't then you're just it's a falling knife right see if it holds support I don't know if it's going to hold support a lot of these Els aren't holding support like Ada Bitcoin sure is H holding support dot Bitcoin I mean what is there to say right Litecoin Bitcoin as I said before what it does best is bleed against Bitcoin or Litecoin bleeds against it link Bitcoin just said madic Bitcoin I I think I think there's a good chance that madic Bitcoin will will bottom before eth Bitcoin um so if you see madic Bitcoin bottoming then it might mean eth is gonna bottom against Bitcoin but I don't there's not really a clear evidence yet that it's bottomed um I've said forever that once madic gets below a thousand stats you got to be on the lookout for it and it's already gone below a thousand so as it continues to bleed here look to see if it can form a low right that doesn't mean the USD valuation is done bleeding even when the madic Bitcoin low is in the madic USD valuation can go down after madic Bitcoin bottoms same thing for eth Bitcoin and ethusd and Ada Bitcoin and Ada USD and Bitcoin and USD right it's the same thing but either way I mean look you have two scenarios here right I mean the markets don't tend to go sideways for very long so it's either going to go up or it's going to go down my contention my contention is that if it goes up all Bitcoin Get Wrecked if it goes down all Bitcoin pairs Get Wrecked so Bitcoin dominance goes up no matter what right so that's why I've said you know rinse your hands of the altcoin market until lose for monetary policy AR that's been my view um admittedly whenever I whenever I get super vocal about it uh you know inevitably someone does it and then and then we get a bounce and they hate me for three months but um it's been my V for two and a half years you know if if it took you until now to to get on board with dominance train that's not my fault what's my long-term stance on E Bitcoin I don't really know I'd like to see if it can bottom at 03 to 04 someone says interesting that dominance isn't spiking as hard as a few days ago as when we hit 60k there's an interesting dominance chart and that's like dominance excluding Stables um and it's actually kind of doing what it did LA I mean it it it did something similar last cycle where it sort of swept the high and then cooled off for a little bit and then kept moving up I think it's going to move up it might it might cool off for a week or two but I I do think you know in May and June you should see the dominance a lot higher um especially you know especially as we get further out into the summer right like May June maybe even out to July I don't know I think the hard part is the dominance rally has taken a lot longer than I thought it was going to so I don't really want to limit it to May or June like it could rally until August or September for all I know um but I mean it it it really depends on on just how quickly it it takes things to you know to to to play out you know and I I don't know um if if if for instance right I mean like like like let's suppose if e Bitcoin bounces after the having like it bounced after the spot ETF right you see after the spot ETF e Bitcoin got a bounce if it gets another bounce then I mean it essentially delays everything by like a month or two you know um so it kind of depends like I don't know if it's going to get that bounce after after the having um you can see that last cycle we we did get sort of a similar type of Bounce but eth Bitcoin hadn't actually broken the range lows on a weekly close whereas here it already has so you know I don't know you got s your one two three um one two three you can kind of see it's already breaking so I don't know if it's going to get that bounce at all anyways and the last time it didn't get a bounce um it didn't get that final bounce right it just broke through so there's definitely like evidence to suggest that it could go it could get a bounce but my base case is that is that um e Bitcoin bleeds you know my base case is I don't I'm not going to bother trying to predict every single low or high by the E Bitcoin pair I'm just going to say look I think it's going to go down if it goes up in a twoe time frame or something so what that doesn't change anything for me it doesn't move the needle um just like all these other lower highs didn't move the needle for me someone says you all expect a balance from 58 I don't know where did it go um how low did it go I mean it just went to 59 six um so I mean that so what is that what is that measured from the top so that's about a 19 so we've now gone 19% down a lot of those pullbacks before were about 20 to 22% so it's getting pretty close to that typical pullback if it's more than a 22% drop if it's like a 25 or 30% drop then you could still get a sizable rally off of that like 2019 but it it probably is even more definitive evidence that the local top is in right because that's what happened in 2019 is after e Bitcoin broke down um you finally had a 30% drop as opposed to just like a 10 to 15% drop um so if you get a larger drop then it you could still get a balance off of that level but it probably is kind of some evidence that whatever comes after is a lower high if you bounce it 20 to 22% down there's still a chance right there's still a chance that you know you could see another move up but even in that case you still have to watch that 8we moving average because that 8we SMA is is potentially we're potentially going to get a weekly close below it um and we've we've I mean I shouldn't have to explain why that's important we've talked about it for the last year uh but you know when that happens it can certainly mean the market is cooling off and and you can see that it really cooled off over here last summer as well as it went below the eight-week moving average same thing in 2021 both Peaks same thing in 2019 right once you get that Weekly close below the eight-week estima it doesn't mean you can't get another face ripping rally back up to a lower high but it does tend to mean that the party's going to be over um for at least a little while for someone who has a higher risk tolerance you think D saying Al now a bad play I think it makes sense to do what you're comfortable with I mean like I I don't think that like what I'm doing makes sense for everyone um I think it kind of depends on where you are in your own Journey you know I mean if you want to take on more risk who am I to tell you not to do it you know I mean there's been plenty of people that took on risk and made a lot of money so I I think you have to remember like what's right for me is not what's right for you do I see Bitcoin hitting higher highs before a summer slump um that's a good question I don't really know I mean you know with the spot ETF we you know the market wasn't really looking that great and then it it just spiked up and put in a new high right so like you know and then and then it and then it real you know radically sold off after it now of course we ended up going up a lot higher but um it it's really hard to say I mean I think that we're probably going to get to the point where you know everyone's gonna think at least that it's going to go to a new High um especially if you get some type of like rally like that off back up above the 8we estim like we saw in 2019 and 2021 I don't know I mean I I do think there is a case to be made the closer you get to May and stuff that um you're GNA see that summer lle come into play I'm not going to say it can't go put in a new High I mean I mean look at the wick into the spot ETF right look at that Wick right I mean if we replicate that then you know it's essentially a new high but I mean it's risky right it's risky to sort of bet stuff on that again I don't I don't base my investment strategy on whether I think Bitcoin is going to Wick back up to the highs or not like that's not something that I even care about um I don't really know I mean I I do think there there is some reasons to think that with eth Bitcoin breaking down and gold breaking out that it could turn into into something more but um that something more could still be one or two months away right where it you know like over here it after it fell below the 8 week and then still rallied back up for a few weeks and then it fell um in 2019 after it fell below the 8 week you know it still it still rallied back up for a few weeks and then it it still and then it finally fell it took a while right I mean it took a while and and you might get something like that right where it just takes a while if it plays out like late 2021 that would probably be the most brutal way uh to you know to potentially put in a local top is to just not even really get a relief rally and just kind of go straight back down um right after the Bitcoin having that would probably the most brutal way if that happens look to see what happens to all coin pairs under such an environment you can see that Bitcoin is is going down today it's down about three and a half% and dominance is up right I mean this is what I we've talked about forever right you know you get into the phase of the cycle where Bitcoin goes down and Bitcoin dominance goes up Jessica ask is it having the 19th or the 20th it depends on where you live um you know in the uh in the states it looks like it's going to be the 19th but if you're in Europe or something you know like UTC time you can see it's potentially going to be the 20th so if like you're in Europe or Asia or something it's going to be the 19th if you're in the states it's going to be the uh or sorry if you're in Europe or Asia it's going to be the 20th if you're in the states uh it's going to be or you know just on North America South America right it's going to be um uh April April 19th so it depends on where you live again guys make sure you subscribe if you're not subscribed uh we have I'm trying to get to 800,000 subscribers so it would in fact be nice to get there if you would not mind subscribing we actually just gained some so we are now at 799,000 so I just need 96 more people um so yeah um if you could subscribe that'd be great and also we do have the sale on ITC premium links in the description below that's going to end after the having so just fair warning um any other things should we wrap it up What If the Fed raises rates this year I don't really think they're going to raise rates I mean if they do I think that would be a really bad mistake I I don't think they're going too um but yeah if they raise rates it probably just makes Bitcoin dominance go even higher you know frankly um I don't think they're going to raise rates but yeah that's what it would mean could a rising alt pair on its total three valuation or could alt total three pairs on dayl an indication of future strength yeah if you if you're seeing an altcoin kind of like outperforming most other altcoins then it's probably an indication of future strength there's a good chance it is not necessarily but I mean like not set in stone but like I've seen that happen a lot of times where if an altcoin is showing relative strength in a dump then whenever you know whatever there's the next relief rally then it can it can outperform a lot of other alts in a in a pump huh how do I keep my ego in check after being right for so long guys the reality is that I have I mean I haven't been right about everything there's been so many things I get wrong and that's how I keep my ego in check is because the markets humble everyone um you know yes some some things I've been right about but also a lot of things I've been wrong about and and you know when you get things wrong it humbles you and um and the market humbles us all someone says they unsubbed and subbed again just for me I I appreciate that looking back should fed of raise rates a few I don't think so I think they're doing what they need to do I don't know if I'm going to go live in 20 hours I don't know I don't know I do think there's going to be a lot of volatility though I think it's going to be uh kind of crazy it might not be tomorrow because technically UTC time it's the it'll be the next day but you're probably going to see a lot of volatility going into the having so just be aware of that um yeah what does the extension from the 20we look like it's kind of funny I uh I put out a video about it um and it ended up doing the same thing that it always does and everyone over complicated it once again um which is kind of fascinating right it really is fascinating how like every single time it just does the same thing it always does you know um and every time no one wants to believe it right again the trend this trend line will eventually Break um because otherwise it just implies that Bitcoin will only ever go below its 20 week SMA and never get back above it um if it if you carry it out far enough So eventually this trend line will break but it hasn't broken yet and um I mean I do think it will break but not yet it hasn't broken yet is it just a coincidence that ta allines with macros current War scare I I think we find reasons for things um I think we we like to blame we like to like rationalize why things are happening that's my guess because like if imagine this like imagine if you had this like War thing you know like the whatever you know the current scare going on right now and if the markets were up 10% then everyone would just say oh they're up because it means that it means that we're going to start printing money to fight the war you know but if we're down then people are like oh it's down because you know everyone's scared because of the war right I mean whatever happen s you can find a narrative to to support that view right so like if tomorrow the price is up then people will say oh price is up on fears that the war is happening therefore the money you know people are the the central banks are going to start printing again um if the markets are down it'll just be markets tumble on you know worries about tensions across seats you know so I mean it it it it really does feel like we look for the reason to explain the price but really price leads the narrative The Narrative doesn't lead the price whatever the price does we'll figure out the narrative to go along with it um not the other way around um also the other thing too is once you hear about the news it's already been priced in because you know I know we all think we're special but you know there's there's going to be other people that get the news before we do and algorithms that can you know price that stuff in way before we can so by the time you see it it's already been priced in theoretically you know it's not like it's not like you're going to go read the news on some news outlet and then be able to like get an edge generally speaking right because if if you're reading it on a news Outlet then s have millions of other people so what Edge would you have actually after some of the last tensions and didn't we get a bounce where we swept the high in um in 2022 I think we did I mean it wasn't like we didn't sweep the the actual top but we swept that local high I think um because the uh Iran invaded Ukraine like right here right and you had a a long Wick down and and then the market rallied back up and it actually swept the highs so yeah I mean like it's certainly possible that something like that could happen I I'm not going to say it can't happen um I mean I don't know if this is exactly the same pattern or not yeah like if you take this and you just sort of overlay it to this one right I mean you can kind of see that the market ch around in this range and then It ultimately it kind of looks like it's deviating some though because it was like following it it bounced up it was following it and then and then the market rallied but then this time the market has kept going down but maybe because it's the whole retaliation stuff that hadn't been priced in yet um but I mean you can see that it it did go back up sweep the high right it swept the high and then it got a a a big pullback so imagine how hard that would be for Market participants if you go up and and you sweep the high and then you drop into the summer right and that's why I think it makes sense to just have a strategy either way I mean like try not to stress so much about it um just have a strategy and and and I I wouldn't like try to over complicate it I mean because you also might not get that I mean you might not see that same type of move and it could also be dependent on other things I mean like you know if if in May the unemployment rate comes in at 4% or something then you know maybe the markets go down right because they're like oh crap the labor market sucks now um but if you get a Lower Print at like 3.7 or something then maybe the market rallies back um and people use that as the reason someone says they're 90% down on their mcoins back I am sad to hear that uh if you're if you're telling the truth and hopefully you can maybe stay away from the mcoin market and focus on other things someone says if you're chasing new Cycles you will always lose I would agree with that I I think that yeah like the news isn't going to give you an edge on in the markets oh did I say Iran I meant um I me Russia yeah I'm thinking about the uh the current conflict and and and um and the and the one that's you know happened that sort of kicked off in 2022 so yeah I meant I meant um me Russia see I don't know we'll see we'll see if it uh what happens here if it sweeps the low and then if it if it moves back up up into the having or or what is the bmark support B8 WEA valid for total market cap chart I I imagine it would be something similar um I think it would be something similar so the 8we for total Market is at 2.43 trillion so for us to get a rally back up there it would from this level it would be about a 12% rally to get back up to the 8we estimate for total Market am I up to dat on the candidates tournament yeah there's a tie for first place with like what two games to go all right guys I think we're going to wrap it up uh thank you guys for tuning in again subscribe if you're not subscribed uh we are still looks like we're at 79,90 so I need

The Bitcoin Halving' by 'Benjamin Cowen' released on 2024-04-18 00:00:00\\nvideo url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS-ramvvRFU\\n\\nHi, this is NFA live this should be a relatively exciting show for two reasons first of all we have the Bitcoin having coming up in just about a day and we also have a new guest with us today Max from because Bitcoin uh how you doing great thanks so much for having me Ben yeah and you started you started doing this a year or two ago is that right yeah probably about 18 months ago officially yep all right yeah so max is um I've known him basically since probably before he even started the YouTube channel or right around the time that he started it uh so make sure you guys go subscribe to him and Rob as well uh links to that are in the description below so make sure you guys check that out and we're just going to go through a lot of the different questions that I think would probably be on people's minds as we go into the having uh so let's just go ahead and jump in Rob we'll start with you on this one the having is tomorrow it's tomorrow we've been waiting forever here it is fourth having um and I'm guessing it's going to garnish some attention should be making some headlines different places I'm curious what what effects do you think the having will have on the larger crypto space um do you think it'll bring new eyes to the scene or are we still kind of just uh you know the same old same old people just kind of hanging out um do you think it'll it'll actually bring new new people to the space uh we saw a lot of new people come to the space last cycle sometime after the having um or do you think it'll be quiet for a while and do you see any narrative shifts after the Havoc that's a pretty loaded question first of all I would just like to say that Max has a great background I'm sure he got to the same place I did which is fivr and uh hopefully he didn't get ripped off but it looks great and uh I gotta tell you one of these days max we're gonna have to put that into an nft just me and you so yeah yes that is my old green screen but I'll be jumping in that green screen as soon as the uh as the Bitcoin hits 100K But to answer Ben's question which I think is is what uh everybody wants to really try to figure out is this Bitcoin having and I know like there's a lot of first of all that I still believe in the fouryear cycle some people say that it doesn't really register I still and some people will talk like Bob Lucas will say well it's just left translated and we're going to see a big blowoff top in 2024 which could very well happen but I still think that the narrative around it and there's still a lot of people say well there's Mass adoption coming and it's already here I still think it's I mean I don't think that we're at the same level like we should be and what we could be in like 2028 or 2032 or you know time comes up but Ben if you get to show my my screen real quick because everyone wants to know like well the Bitcoin having and you did a great I I watched your your video Ben about uh uh the ethereum evaluation ethereum ethereum valuation of Bitcoin about how you know Bitcoin dominance is going up and how it's wreaking havoc and it's true it is right now I know people will will also talk about you know like hey well you know these things happen leading up to the having but if we take a look back this is from Smart Valor it's a good website and if we take a look they did all the work for him which is great this is how Bitcoin behav in the year leading up to each having because we had one of course in 2012 2016 then 2020 and I know people will say well there's always a dip there's always this massive dip before the having and there could be I mean we saw one pretty massive one in 2020 but of course there's a reason for that and and we could either say like it's because of the of the almighty Corona virus or it was something else but yeah there was a dip in 2016 but again just take a look at this so with having with the having one in 2012 the year leading up to the having it went up to 385 per. and the year after of course because we always see alltime highs the year after so far it went up 5,000% having two in 2016 leading up to it 142% now there's dips along the way and we're seeing that right now but then a year after that in 2017 2 84% in 2020 even though there was a turbulent year like we talked about it was still up 17% for the year getting into that having in May I think it was May 12 2020 and then it went up almost five almost 600% the year after that and we can see here that that yeah same thing happened the year leading up to to the having on November 208th 2012 this is what Bitcoin was 250 and then of course we come up and then you can see right here that yes there is a a drop before that and then it comes up and there's a drop before but it's like the same thing as like a bull market so we're seeing the same thing kind of Replay I know it's a funny thing because like Ben you'll say like uh you say hey I I I told you that the Bitcoin ethereum evaluation was going to start to start to lose momentum or actually bleed away to ethereum and then people were going to blame a Black Swan event and they never would have saw it coming but here we are and again same thing happens here 2015 a year going into it yes it's not a straight line but we kind of I mean really rallied into it there's you know dips along the way but I mean it's going in that right direction and then of course 2019 to 2020 we started at 7325 we had it kind of flat and then we saw the almighty Corona virus right here but then we rallied into it so I still feel like the same thing's gonna Happ happen that's just how I see things and I'm I'm feeling pretty good about this having so far but the big question is and and we we'll talk about this later is what's the macro is there going to be quantitative easing or more quantitative Tiding are they actually going to cut rates are we going to have the liquidity that we absolutely need which we had beforehand even though we're in quantitative uh tightening right now I mean we still rallied pretty well but can we get that liquidity back in the market and that's I think that's the big question on top of the fact of are we going to see World War II so yeah that's where I got yeah it's interesting because you know at some point you would think we would need to make the shift from quantitative tightening to quantity to quantitative easing but what needs to trigger that shift is the is the is the thing that I I think we're kind of wrestling with um someone asked where a guy was I I should have mentioned that he's he's in Dubai and I mean there's obviously a lot of stuff going on right there going on right now there with the conference and um everything so he wasn't able to make it this week um so um Max I I'll put the same question to you I mean like what are your thoughts here on the Bitcoin having um is this just kind of the same old thing that we've seen before and everyone's trying to over complicate it uh do you see any kind of shifts coming after after the having what are your thoughts yeah I I would agree with the with the last part I think that a majority of people and it's very easy to do this I I tend to do it all the time is to sort of chronically over complicate something that has for over a decade now been a pretty reliable uh we'll just we'll call it a risk on event and in the simplest of terms all you need to do is you know pull up your trading view chart and Mark out every single Bitcoin having right you need at this point you know you need to draw four vertical lines whenever a Bitcoin having has occurred look at the the price action that has basically come almost immediately following so um you know I I try to look at this thing from Every Which angle you know I look at it from the side I look at it up side down I you know I try to include the macro and and fed policy in all of my decisionmaking but um you know the truth of the matter is this is a very unique time to be in the markets right Bitcoin is now on the global stage in my opinion for the first time um there is you know new on-ramps into crypto you know specifically being these you know nine ETFs um and it is you know there's more regulatory Clarity the accounting standards have shift did in a positive light and are working to you know become more friendly for corporations and big money to actually onboard into this digital commodity if they choose to do so um but again like Rob had mentioned and Ben like you commented on there also are some macro headwinds which can only be ignored for so long unfortunately I am of the belief that we do still have some time I believe we're maybe on borrowed time some people probably don't like to hear that but but I do believe that there is this this unique pocket of time where it's all coming together and we can really see risk perform um positively of course I don't have to tell you guys this and I probably don't have to tell the audience this but historically during a Fed pause until something has quote unquote kind of broken and we see Unemployment uh you know trending above 4% and the FED actually has to step in and begin easing through you know interest rate cuts and other measures um we can actually see risk you know being stocks and now crypto performed tremendously well and you know going back to you know to the last cycle you know we actually kind of went through a little mini fed cycle here and you know 2018 2019 and 2020 um you know where Bitcoin actually the floor kind of gave out we dropped to about 3K and then we had that famous rally into June of 2019 when we topped um you know there was actually hikes going into that and then of course right as Bitcoin basically topped in June of 2019 the FED began to actually cut rates um more or less right after that and it did dramatically affect Bitcoin some will say you know it was a reflexivity and you know we had to you know we we sprung hard off of that local floor so you know of course the market corrects to the downside some will say it's covid some will say it was in the charts the whole time some will say it's not I don't know you know nobody knows whether it would have happened with Co or or without um but again I don't think that this time really is that much different I think that every cycle has some distinct differences from from a previous one I mean for example last cycle we had a double top we haven't had a true double top before we have had a cycle like the 2013 one where we had you know two pronounced Peaks but a true double top had never happened before and additionally in the bare Market we had never spent as much time below the 200 WEA as we just did coming out of this most recent bear so there are you know of course Very recognizable and notable differences of every cycle but you to answer the question Point Blank I don't think that this time is much different and I I'm trying my best to not overthink it um and say you know what there is no reason for the FED to intervene at this point we're trending in that direction and we are on borrowed time there is a Day of Reckoning coming but I do believe at the earliest it's probably sometime in Q4 we have the having you know in less than two days and I do believe that there's plenty of room for risk to run in the short to Middle term maybe going out six months okay yeah no I mean it's great to get you guys opinions um and the market has been on an absolute tear I mean essentially after since October right I mean it was pretty boring summer last year but then since October uh the market has basically just been up only up until the last few weeks but um you know the next thing I'd like to talk about is of course Rob's absolutely favorite topic and it's of course Bitcoin dominance um and you know I you know you guys know My Views but I always like to get other other views because you know I'm I it's it's a good idea not to live in an echo chamber so Bitcoin dominance has once again broken a new highs I I we saw 57% actually it came really really quickly really quickly you know that that move to 57% it's kind of cooled off back you know it's back down to like the 55 like 55 and a half or so so it has cooled off quite a bit since that rally up to 57% uh so uh Max I'll start with you first on this one do you think it's going to keep going up after the having um you know it was it it was going up into the spot ETF and then it kind of waned a little bit following the spot ETF but then it just kind of picked right back up so what do you think is gonna happen this time and and this kind of goes to the whole like the last question as well like will there be a narrative shift and what people are focused on will they will they start focusing on more things besides you know sticking with Bitcoin um do you see you know what are your thoughts on that Max well first I have to give you a compliment Ben because you were one of the few people that with a big following publicly called Bitcoin dominance rallying to this point I didn't expect it to get up to I think it topped at what 57 recently or wherever did you you deserve a lot of credit for that well I'm known for riding Trends too long see well we'll see right nobody knows besides the market right like you know we we all have our our inclinations but uh you deserve a lot of credit because I remember months and months AG I don't it was probably six months ago plus we did a space together or you came on on my my channel because Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance was significantly lower and eth BTC was significantly higher and much has changed since then so kudos to you where do I think it goes from here so I think that Bitcoin dominance is in the process of we'll call it distribution okay I believe believe that the meat of the move is over um but that does not preclude it from going a little bit higher than here maybe maybe 60% that's not my base case but you know let's let's look left on the chart and you know use that to you know maybe forecast what could happen next so ignoring the you know whether this is a left translated cycle or an expedited cycle let's look at it contextually for where Bitcoin is at um you know from from a a p perspective right so Bitcoin actually has gone on to get above the previous cycle all-time high of 69k so most comparably again ignoring everything else but just pure levels on the chart pure you know where was the cycle High where was the cycle low you could probably compare Bitcoin right now to like December of 2020 okay if we just ignore everything else and say okay Bitcoin in December of 2020 went on to sweep the previous cycle all-time high of 197 it paused there for what maybe a month or or something like that it was chopping around altcoins got destroyed during that time right Bitcoin uncertainty like you always preach Ben uh when Bitcoin is uncertain alts get absolutely eviscerated and we are seeing that once again right so um again comparing this period of time to December of 2020 there is turbulence under the previous cycle all-time high which is not uncommon we saw that again last cycle and then also two cycles ago it seems to be sort of the same thing happening again what did we see in December of 2020 well what we saw was Bitcoin dominance basically put in a deviation or bull trap High where on when Bitcoin finally decided it was time to push through with conviction above the previous cycle all-time high of 197 you saw Bitcoin dominance put in an explosive move which ultimately ended up being sort of a bull trap you know for for the Bitcoin Maxis um so I I think it's possible we are seeing that Devi that deviation high right now only time will tell um I do have hedges in place you know like I'm I'm holding some Bitcoin l2s like STX and some Bitcoin ordinals and things like that that I think would be beneficiaries of you know Bitcoin dominance continued rally maybe above 60% um but of course you know I I really I am of the belief that contextually with Bitcoin chopping under the previous cycle all-time high seeing similar signs of Bitcoin dominance putting in you know this this last explosive push I do believe that over the next six months or so it would probably makes sense to see Bitcoin dominance Trend down dramatically and additionally and and I don't mean to you know bring this up because I don't know if this is on the agenda today exactly I imagine that that would translate to eth BTC finding a bottom sooner rather than later but that doesn't again preclude it from going down a little bit more and only time will tell yeah no I mean it's great and I mean I I I think it's always worthwhile to hear these other views because um you know no one really knows right I mean you know no one really knows and you know one thing that I've wrestled with a lot before and I've seen other people do this too is like you know just because someone gets something right doesn't mean they're going to be right they're going to keep being right right and also just because someone gets something wrong doesn't mean they're GNA be keep being wrong I mean you know markets change no one knows what's going to happen and I I I could see eth Bitcoin carving out a bottom this summer um that's kind of my base case I could see that actually happening so we'll see if that happens Rob what are your thoughts I mean I know you're you're more of a you're more of a Bitcoin Maxi yourself right Bitcoin dominance to 100% I yes exactly go ahead Ben what was your question I'm just kidding I'm just kidding what what are your thoughts here on on on dominance do you think it's uh you think we're getting pretty close to the uh to the top well first of all let me just say that I I I was like listening to to Max especially on like the Twitter spaces and things like that he's very smooth in his delivery and very smart and and what he talks about so I gotta tell you it's good to hear like different sets of opinions it's great to have a Max here so to talk about I mean Bitcoin dominance I got to tell you like when you were talking the 60% I'm like yeah you know I can kind of see it you know I was I was I was under the assumption like well you know it always kind of comes back that way right something happens there's something that happens in the market a Black Swan event or you know something that's just that kind of has disruption and then people get scared and they're they're like okay I'm risk on but not that risk on to go into like you know Pepe coin I'm gonna go into the safest asset in the most volatile industry which would be Bitcoin and I I could see that for sure but then like there's a narrative that that people are always talking about especially in in in the crypto space being the Bitcoin maxos are going to say Bitcoin only right but there are narratives that are out there one of those is dpin Right centralized physical infrastructure Network the other one are dexes because we see what's going on with the centralized exchanges getting sued getting their pants sued off by the SEC and then leaving of course so we have to have dexes and then of course there's another big one which is web 3 so we talk about that but there's one that I feel is on an undertone and Max alluded to it when he was talking about it when he talked about runes and he talked about ordinals and he talked about things like stacks and l2s and I think what's gonna really push Bitcoin dominance up I know Ben loves this part too is uh the the l2s or even l1s that are going to be built on bitcoin Ben if you just throw this this chart up I always talk about this website it's l2. watch so imagine this and I and and and even like Adam back has talked about this how he's talked about he hates the fact that everybody's building off of Bitcoin people should just build on bitcoin because he says it's like it's it's like the tcpip layer for for the internet so why can't they just build on the most the safest most secured Network or computerized Network ever built in the entire world and he was right so when I take a look at these these l2s that are coming out and they're all new so you I to understand like this some most of these are trash let's just let's just call it SP Spade but like when we talk about things that are coming out that are actually doing pretty good like a Stax who's been around for quite some time I can really see things actually happening for sure and then like I just dropped a a video on my second Channel where I talked about core core is a top uh 50 well it's 56 now but it's essentially an L1 L2 type of uh uh token which is built right on top of Bitcoin using delegated proof of work and delegated proof of stake together to actually make dexes nfts and a whole host of things you can only do with smart contracts so when I see stuff like this happening I'm like why can't we take away the nonsense that's going on over in ethereum world and they're massive gas fees like just like with with core and stacks right now if you use it or the things that are being built on top of it they're just going through their Satoshi initiative it's super cheap and it's super fast so for me to see that Bitcoin dominance could go up why couldn't it especially with the different institutions that are here and how they've been drilled into it now they can say oh there's something else I can do and also smart I see it could actually go above 60% but again I'm not always right no I mean I I've it's possible it's certainly possible um I think the answer is going to probably come in the next few weeks because you know there's two prior examples where we had these kind of these like closes below the 8we ese 2021 and 2019 and in 2021 after it happened Bitcoin got a rally eth Bitcoin went up but in 2019 when Bitcoin got that rally eth Bitcoin went down so I think if we see Bitcoin get some type of relief I don't know maybe sometime after the having into may I I don't know exactly when it would be but whenever that comes whatever happens to eth bitcoin should be very telling about where we are in the cycle so I I'm going to be focused a lot on that um over the next few weeks but we will see um next question Rob I'm GNA start with you on this one to rotate and you know I remember last year you saying something like this um and and you ended up being correct it was basically you know sell and man go away um like I mean no one's D Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear since October I mean you know I mean it was basically like 25 to 30k not even that long ago um and I I think sometimes we forget just how quickly it has moved so I'm curious like do you think it's going to be similar to last summer where we just get the market gets boring before maybe moving up again like later in the year or something you think it's just going to get boring for a few months um do you think or on the other hand do you think everyone's gonna get think it's boring and then we just get another you know face what's it called like a face melting Rally or something that's exactly face yeah I mean like so so what are your thoughts going into the summer because I mean again I know last summer you you thought it was going to be boring do you think it's going to be boring again this summer or you think it's going to be different Matt well first of all I I hope so I I really do because everybody who's in the chat right now answer a question for me uh tell me if you think that you've accumulated enough where you're like you know what I've bought plenty of Bitcoin and I just cannot handle any more bags I just I don't want to buy anymore especially if it goes down and gets cheaper just let me know in the comment section because it seems like when these types of things Ben when you say things are boring this is great because this is when people who like the dollar cost average is fantastic or if you're Dynamic DCA is things go down which I think where we at the risk levels now 0.6 0.59 somewhere around there a little yeah I think a little above 0 six so like if we're in this place we're like well I mean for me this is a good time to just accumulate a little bit but as we start to like if it goes sideways well great I have more time to bring things in but then if you if you want to talk about selling May and go away there's this great chart on this website that I steal from constantly and if you just take a look because it's it's yeah it's a nice website it's very nice I think there's a sale going on until like tomorrow and then it goes away so but if if you say sell in May and go away it it actually works out pretty well I mean historically speaking but then if you really want to break it down because people say but Rob you don't get it because this is the having year so it's all it doesn't really it count well if you take a look at it I mean if you sold at the end of May of 2020 I mean you had a 30% increase on January a couple of drops there 34 and 10% and then you're down here and you just kind of stay away until October and then you buy in and then October rallies November rallies and December rallies that's not bad I mean I'll take that year right and if we go back to 2016 I mean it's the same type of thing if I want to sell in May okay well June's gonna go up but I have red red I take I stay away September as well and I I buy back in October November December I'm doing pretty good so I still think it can work out all right the thing that you have to understand though and one more thing is is this there's a presidential election I think this is going to be pretty tumultuous as we get into it so there was this piece from hbk's wealth and it talked about the presidential election years versus the non-election as far as returns and this is just taking a look at the S&P 500 you can see that in the presidential election years which this is that year it sends to like kind of peek off around March April and then just kind of fall away until we get into junisha may go away October is here you buy back in and then we have a nice little rally of course drop here and then off we go but 10% for that year is not too bad now does that mean that I'm going to sell everything no no I'm just telling you these are just the data points that we can say take a look at me personally I'm just here to accumulate and uh get into some early round type of cryptos that could either make a lot of money or go to zero one of those two will always happen yeah I was looking at this um this is uh this is the S&P 500 in 2024 compared to the average of all election years right I mean so you can see like it has come down a lot recently but it also went up a lot too like way more than it does on average so there's just been a lot more volatility this cycle than I think we've seen in a lot of Prior Cycles um but yeah I I thought that was interesting and that chart sort of reminded me of that uh Max what are your thoughts here I mean I know earlier you said you expected uh risk to do pretty well um over the next six months but you know even with that do you think that the market could cool off before that phase or do you think it's not going to really get much of a breather or do you think the Breather is almost over yeah that's it's a it's a great question of course we're all from relatively familiar with the uh maybe cliche but overused but also kind of accurate saying of sell and may go away um one thing that I've been preaching for a while going back to I mean even I would say Q4 of last year is that I was seeing signs early on of a maybe expedited cycle for crypto um and it's probably off of of you know the back of this this fed paw and there isn't quite as much in my opinion economic deterioration as a lot had thought myself included and we're in this you know kind of Goldilocks window where risk can rally really unencumbered um you know so so do I think that selling may go away will come to fruition I I would think that worst case in my opinion from what I'm seeing right now and again of course subject to change it's just one man on the internet's opinion I think that similarly to how this cycle for crypto is being a little bit front Rand and we've actually seen for the first time a Bitcoin all-time high before a having which of course had never happened before um I also think it's possible that selling may go away is being front ran a little bit and we're seeing that right now with this April correction so similarly to Rob I am not I am not in the camp of you know drisking or selling spot because again like I mentioned in you know during our first question here if you just draw four vertical lines on your trading View and Mark out every Bitcoin having look what typically happens in the six to nine months following Additionally you know for a lot of us that have been slowly you know and thoroughly meticulously dcing into our digital digital assets and our unregistered Securities over the past year you know a lot of us have tax consequences for selling right now and I'm I'm not really interested in incurring any uh you know tax consequences trying to reposition because May perhaps is a little bit choppy so in my opinion you know and again going back you know the past 18 months for Bitcoin we haven't seen more than a 22% correction on bitcoin so from our local high recently take it down 22 to 25% maybe you get 57 56 worst case that's not enough for me to incur you know a taxable event to try to reposition so uh maybe it happens maybe it doesn't but for me ultimately it doesn't make a big difference because the having is in a couple days um and typically what happens after a having is months and months of prosperity and hopefully price discovery yeah no it's a fair point I mean I think like all the corrections that we've had by Bitcoin for the entire bull market have only been about 20 to 22% yeah we've already seen it go down about what 18% or so um so that I think that'll be the the area I mean if we get down there see if it turns around and if it does maybe the time's not different you know but yeah what do you think Ben do you think selling May and go away will come to ahead um I think now I mean so I so we went into the 7 to point8 risb in March so that I think was the time to to drisk some kind of like during the spot ETF um at this point it's kind of like when we went back to 39K after the spot ETF um we then it was it was a 22% drop and then we just rallied after it right and and so I was like you know this could be our preh having year dip and then the rally just continued and so now it's kind of the same thing it's like you know the the area to do it if you were convinced about it would have been in in March you know um when gold broke out because that's actually in 2019 when Bitcoin topped was when gold broke out um so I think that would have been the time to do it now I do think there is a risk of if you've waited if you've waited till this point and now bitcoin's down 20% we did see both in after the 20209 or the 2019 top and the 2021 top the first weekly close bow of the 8we SMA we then had a rally back up you know to the we right which is around 67k we actually went slightly above it in both cases so I think what what's more important is not exactly what happens here at the range lows but it's what happens whenever we get a relief move does it sustain or does it just put in a lower high I think that is kind of the thing to look for because back in after the spot ETF it wasn't a lower high we just you know had another face ripping rally fire um the the reason why I am more cautious on this one than than the last one is because eth Bitcoin has now broken down and gold is broken out which both of those events marked the 2019 local top and it wasn't the market cycle top and this kind of goes back to what Rob was saying you know there is this idea of a left translated peak in 2024 and I can sort of like I'm like 30% maybe 40% aware of that like you know thinking hey this is this could actually happen you know if if we were to Rally into the summer to higher prices without cooling off then I would be very more so convinced of a left translated Peak but what if what if if you think about what happened after the 2019 top after gold broke out and after e Bitcoin broke down Bitcoin went into a six to n month bare Market in fact now imagine you get that after the having and everyone thinks the cycle is over by the end of 2024 because it just hasn't done anything since the having and then we just get another move in 2025 and then the cycle Peaks when it always does and once again everyone over complicated it you know like there is a chance that that that happens um so I would I think I would just watch to see what happens whenever we get any type of relief does it form into a lower high or does it lead to a higher high and then you probably have your answer to whether it's a left translit cycle or not at that point I can see absolutely yeah and again even in 2019 it was it was just a local top we bled for a while we actually bled back to the 100 we SMA um and then and then we started to go back back up and then we had the we had the pandemic crash but if you ignore that it was just sort of a bleed after all Bitcoin pairs broke down and then and then once we got that back you know we start to go back up those are my and and by the way I mean you've always said this going back when you know before I started my business and I was watching all of your videos you know years ago Ben you used to always say something kind of along the lines of you know the longer it takes you know the higher will ultimately go something along those lines and you know I think a uh this idea of a prolonged sort of midcycle Correction freaks a lot of people out because everybody wants to be rich overnight myself included right of course i' I'd love for us to just go straight up in a straight line and I hope that we do but ultimately I don't think it would be a death sentence for Bitcoin to kind of reestablish value between 55 and 75k for even a full quarter um you know I think ultimately would probably lead to more constructive uh price action to the upside in the long run but people you know their patients will be tested no question yeah yeah I mean I think the the the thing to look for in the cycle I think is is the Bitcoin dominance I I really do think it's the key for the cryptoverse and I think I think that dominance will Top before Bitcoin Falls below the 20we SMA that's my guess is that it's going to top before Bitcoin Falls below it and I think between now and then Bitcoin gets occasional rallies that just take off Bitcoin pairs even lower is my guess um so that's why I just say like you know if you want exposure to crypto Bitcoin I mean you know Bitcoin is is a relatively safe bet if you want to take on more risk there's obviously the altcoin market there's the full DJ mcoin Market um but you have to be careful with those and I I I think the winning strategy with the altcoin market and and even if you are in the riskier memec coin stuff is just to remember like in five years that Meme coin is probably not going to exist No One's Gonna care about it because they're going to be worried about the next stage of mean points right so the way the way to navigate it is it's okay to have exposure to various parts if you want to take more risk but just occasionally convert it back to bitcoin if you make a lot of money right because at least you know you then know hey Bitcoin is still going to be around in 10 years I don't know if this random meme coin is Ben how could you say that how dare you my a meme coins oh my I think I've converted most of my audience to bitcoin Maxis at this point but I will say by the time I convince the last person to be a Bitcoin Maxi that's when the dominance tops out and we go back the other way I don't think we're that far away I think maybe this summer dominance tops out we'll see though but you are correct like what anybody out there like if we're being completely honest Would You Bet Your Life that Your Meme coin or your altcoin is going to be around in 50 years would You Bet Your Life on it I probably would not would I bet my life I mean it's an extreme example right would I bet my life or something valuable that Bitcoin will be around bet your would you bet all your money on it or something right that's much more friendly right so and I would for Bitcoin I have a high degree of confidence and that's why your strategy ultimately it's conservative you know relative to a lot of other people that you know talk about crypto publicly but it is ultimately a long-term winning strategy and people need to recognize that profits from altcoins ultimately do have to flow back into Bitcoin that is the sustainable strategy for sure yeah I mean I think Rob I think Rob was talking about this what last week on NFA live we were talking about like what do you do when you get an airdrop and I think what was your strategy like just 50% you take profits on it right away 50% back to bitcoin or USD and then you let there oh no no it was you let let it go up 2X or something or if it goes up 2x then you sell 50% was that what you said yeah I I call it well two things I call it the half and half method so you get into meme coins or something crazy and then let's say you put it you know 100 bucks in and then it goes $200 so then you sell half immediately and you put the other hundred bucks let it ride because that's house money then when it doubles or triples or or quadruples then you take half again or you take two or three or 4X what do you want to do and then you let the ride and you do that until there's no more riding and it just goes away and then you're like well okay I I did 8X but it went to zero so I don't feel so bad because a lot of people just let it go all the way up and all the way down but if you just play with house money there's a reason why like like I I can see people in the in the chats going well this sucks because you know now we're gonna sideways and you know this isn't what I want to be there's a reason why all three of us are pretty much just like on all of our videos on all of our Twitter spaces we're pretty much the same person whether it goes massively up or way way down me's a little bit of excitement but it's because we der risked enough to like well if this happens then we do this if this happens we do that and I think that's where people should would want to be as opposed to just going okay I sold my kidney I hope this memec coin goes up it's one of those things have a plan no matter what and then enjoy your life don't stress about it right I mean have a plan like you know if Bitcoin goes to 50K or even lower so what have a plan if it goes up have a plan I mean it I I think you know I used to navigate crypto without without thinking about like what do I do if this happens I only would navigate it based on one particular outcome I never hedge myself but once I started hedging My Views then it makes things easier you know you're like all right well this is what I think but if I'm wrong I don't want to be you know completely left out of whatever that next trend is um and when I when I get air drops um well I don't I don't really get air drops anymore because I'm not really that active in in the space but when I did when I used to get air drops my strategy was immediately convert half of it to bitcoin at least half to bitcoin and then let whatever else ride because like half the time they would just go to zero anyways um so at least you get some of that value out in inss um why don't we goe and move on because we do have two more questions and then I'd also like to get to audience questions at the end if you post your question now I probably won't see it so maybe wait like 10 minutes and then post it um this is an interesting question and I to be completely honest most people aren't going to care but gold is is one of these things where like it doesn't do anything for like 10 years you know and like if you think about this entire bitcoin's like like it's entire history essentially since 2009 gold has essentially gone nowhere in that in that entire phase but we just saw gold break to new all-time highs and it seems to be a somewhat explosive rally so I'm curious about what your thoughts are on gold um I I often think that people who like gold are are more alike to people who like Bitcoin than they would care to admit I think the main difference is the generation that we are right so if I were born one or two generations ago I probably would have been really into gold you know but because I'm born into more of the digital age I'm more into Bitcoin so I think we're more alike than different um so I'm curious like what your thoughts are on gold here it is now 2300 2400 um max where do you you know do you think that uh this is going to continue I me Silver is also not too far behind it in its own move um and I guess the other question is like why do you think gold is rallying so that's probably the bigger question is is why do you think it's rallying rather than like what do you think it's going to go to sure yeah the gold strength is um pronounced it's very impressive um and and I would say I mean why do people buy gold historically right it's sound money it was sound money before Bitcoin it was a store of value when you know our our parents generation was nervous about the state of the world they would you know convert their into gold and uh you know a lot of it is more of a um it's a mental thing it's a it's a mental insulation it's not like if your country was invaded you're going to put you know 500 pounds of gold on your back and somehow travel to another country right but it's a it's a peace of mind thing you know and you know again historically it is you know a sound currency uh there is a scarcity aspect to it there's a lot of commonality and overlap between gold and Bitcoin and I think everything you mentioned Ben is correct um I would say that my bias on gold um really stems more on my perspective and my my forecast on where I think dxy is headed and similarly where I think Bitcoin is headed I've already shared my opinion on where I think Bitcoin is going we have the Bitcoin having just around the corner um I expect Bitcoin to you Trend upwards aggressively over the next six to nine months subsequently I do believe that dxy is forming a sort of distribute you know a distribution here I do anticipate dxy topping very soon and again if you just overlay gold with dxy on a weekly chart you can see that there is a pretty prominent negative correlation between dxy and gold so I don't think we're I'm not of the opinion that we're going to see a decoupling where there's suddenly a a prolonged period of a positive correlation where gold rallies and dxy rallies I think that one of them is lying so either gold is lying or dxy is lying I think that gold is leading and going to see dxy of course sort of reclaim that negative correlation and begin to take a dive over the next quarter so um I do expect gold to continue upwards and I think it's probably off the back of the you know dxy weakening okay yeah fair enough um it has it has been really strong you know and I I can't help but look at it I'm like wow you have like a 10-year base I the bigger the base the more explosive the rally and for I mean for I know like all the crypto you know Deens are like you know it's up what like 10% or something and like people are like you know like 10% is like a minute candle on a meme coin right but for gold you know for an asset that's that high market cap like that is a big move in a really short period of time and so like that's why it it it means something Rob what are your thoughts here um are you are you are you watching this gold move I'm not watch I mean but I own it I own gold and silver and I I think and I don't I never UND and we talk about this many times I never understood why the old maximalists and this and the precious metal maximalists hate Bitcoin so much because like you said we're trying to all do the same thing we're trying to get out of the Matrix which is relying on paper Fiat and it just seems like I there's there's that one gold bug guy that is what we all talk about for some god- awful reason but in reality I think for the majority of people that are into precious metals I think they can see the value behind it and of of of Bitcoin itself and like I I like I never understood with this guy like why don't we have a debate between that guy and like Mike Maloney Mike Maloney is huge into gold he's put out a great series on precious medals and he's he likes Bitcoin as well so like when I take a look at this I I think you know why why not own why not old gold why not diversify like you know uh we've got I diversify not just in the crypto but the stocks precious metals and and real estate and I think everybody should do the you know kind of do the same thing but to talk about why gold went up so much let me I I don't know but how did gold do in 2022 was there any kind of rally during that time I mean it it it it still mostly stayed below the high I don't really think it did that well um it's only recently really started to show strength I mean I can I can pull it up and see but 2022 was kind of split it rallied in the first half of the year and then didn't really do too much and actually corrected a little bit looks like yeah I mean it looks like it topped in March of 2022 and then basically just went down yeah till November and then it rallied again into December kind of there there's a theory going around about why Gold's rallying so much it's because the Nations that are going to war they are trying they're fearful of us sanctions so how do how do you get away get around those sanctions well you stockpile Alternatives and one of those would be of course gold so people are talking about how Iran could be could have stockpiled after the Damascus situation and the and the bombing and the reason why I ask about 2022 is because for the Ukraine Invasion I think was February 2022 and the same type of thing was being said about Russia stockpiling gold at the same time so I can see I can kind of see that that valuation I don't know why they don't just use Bitcoin it's a heck of a lot easier to transfer and zip around value but that's where we're at yeah I always like I always think those posts by the gold bugs are so disingenuous because I mean like I I own both like I own Bitcoin and gold but like if you go to trading View and you look at the Bitcoin or you look at the Gold valuation against Bitcoin it's down so much since Bitcoin launched that it rounds it to negative 100% like like that's how far the valuation of gold has fallen against Bitcoin since Bitcoin has been around so again like it's not it's just look I mean the the Bitcoin valuation as far exceeded gold for a long time um I mean my guess is over the next 20 years Bitcoin will still outperform gold you know maybe in the short term gold could outperform uh Bitcoin but and I I mean I guess it has been since March right ever since gold broke out Gold's been doing better than even the S&P 500 even the NASDAQ um it's been having my view is that I I I think that gold is breaking out because it senses that um rate cuts are coming sooner than the market is potentially thinking and so that's kind of why I think I I think it's sort of sniffing something out just like it did in 2019 and and um but we'll see I mean you know we'll see if it if it plays out in the same way last question and I mean I you know this is more so geared towards Max um because I mean Rob is I mean you know you've been around here forever we' probably even asked this question you before yeah but I mean if you want to take it if you want to answer you can Max Max yeah so since you're new here um why did you start your YouTube channel I mean like what what was your motivation what are you helping to accomplish with it uh what brings you here well Ben you you actually played a big role in in bringing me here I was a very early follower of yours actually before you even had your website I bought your Google sheet way back in the day and I'm still locked into my original price thank you very much because I got in early pays to get in early um you know I I learned a lot from you in the very beginning and I went through last cycle and you know Ben and and Rob also this you know this is a compliment to both of you guys amongst a sea of grifters and thieves and people looking to prey on unsuspecting retail you know guys like yourselves you you conducted yourselves in a manner that you know I mean I can't even imagine how many millions of dollars you guys turn down from shill deals and you know crap like that and you know I I wanted to in the beginning play my you know play my part in that I felt as though I had opinions that you know um I could share something to offer I have you know I have an ability to lead I have you know an ability to organize a team um and I wanted to play my my part my equal share in the sort of collective hive mind of you know CT and and YouTube and help educate that's sort of the underpinning of of what I'm doing is I like to teach I like to collaborate and you know making money certainly feels nice right but there's a certain there's a certain sense of fulfillment that I personally get out of somebody messaging me saying hey because of what you said it made a difference in my life and something clicked for me and that feels really good and you know I I started because Bitcoin and it was it's a small Channel still um we're growing quickly certainly which of course if you go to Ben's beautiful website and you overlay social media growth with uh you know the price of Bitcoin you can see why I'm starting to grow quicker it's it's I'm doing the same thing I was doing all bare Market it's just suddenly more people care about crypto so um you know I am a i a result of good times and I pray that they continue on because of course it's you know a nice Tailwind for for my young business but yeah I mean really to answer the question Point Blank I love to teach I love to to collaborate and I love to debate you know like I have a differing opinion than you know you guys for some things and there's some overlap but that's what makes a market beautiful is that you can think one thing I can think another and we can come together and just talk about it politely and nobody knows what's going to happen right like we can't I have my hunch I have conviction just like you guys do but Bitcoin dominance could go to 90% And you know even over flip it and put that on on Twitter don't do that don't do that or or it could literally nuke down to 10% we could have like the crypto equivalent of the NASDAQ bubble between 1995 and 2000 where altcoins bubble like people you know can't imagine everybody's thrown money at altcoins speculating anything that's crypto and then 99 out of 100 of them don't exist in a couple years you know so who who knows what's going to happen but yeah I love to to collaborate and teach and debate and uh generally it's it's just a passion of mine how many subscribers are you guys at now like 13 14k or something yes on YouTube somewhere in between there yeah well there's 3,600 people watching so if everyone here goes and clicks the link in the description below and goes over to Max's Channel and subscribes then uh I I'm sure he would appreciate that and I think he deserves that he's been they've been putting out they it's not just Max by the way I mean it's a team of people um so go check that out you guys do like daily live streams right we Yeah we actually have a show coming up at uh 10:00 a.m. eastern time we do a Daily Show we've got a panel of Five Guys we're all just Traders wrap this one up then if you got it coming up in 10 minutes that's okay I got a big team they got it all right well before we before we end it here I I did want to take at least a couple of questions um and one of the questions I saw was um what is the best way to learn about crypto and to do your own research so I mean I don't know if they're talking about like from a fundamental perspective but I if someone were getting into crypto like like what do you guys use to do your research and I mean and maybe talk about like all the different tool or some at least some of the bigger tools that you guys have been using especially for all the different things that are happening in the cryptoverse there seems like there's a thousand different narratives that you could you know that you could follow and whoever wants to take that one is fine go ahead Max yeah um I would start on uh one of our three channels I think that's a really good place not to not to spew the obvious but um I would say I would say learn to do very basic ta right and understand Cycles like there's some very awesome free indicators out there like I mean you can even just look at like you know Ben has a a you he's kind of coined a very famous one he's combined a 20 week SMA and a 21 we EMA which has been sort of uh marketed as the bull market band for good reason right so you can determine when you know Bitcoin is trending upwards High time frame or trending down by just a simple you moving average band there's also things like the P Cycle top which I think people should keep an eye on which is again a free trading view indicator someone someone made it it's also on Ben's website there's also some some good onchain stuff like you know Bitcoin terminal price hoddle waves things like that I would as a beginner I would stay off the hourly time frame like literally just go daily time frame and above um and whenever you see Bitcoin down you know 50% from its its all-time high that's time to start paying attention to maybe consider entering the market but you know learn very very basic ta and and some of the more popular onchain indicators can really help you just DCA at the right time you know but stay off of the hourly time frames mainly the py cycle top just to give credit is uh was developed by Philip Swift um a while back and I the the idea was to predict the top with within 3 days and it did a really great job of doing that in the first uh the first 2021 Peak um and it actually happened I remember it happening and like no one really believed it you know um but I think it was retrofit right it was fit after yeah it was created in 2019 it was created in 2019 okay but it did it did get the first top in 2021 I feel like a lot of these like metrics that everyone created in 2019 uh it they called the first top but then most of them like didn't really call the second top because it was just sort of like a it was like a dead cat bounce that just somehow made it to New highs you know yeah um so yeah that was kind of an interesting one um Rob did you have anything to add just yeah just one thing Max makes all great points the thing I would say is that if you really knew you really really knew you have to understand that it's not how much you make it's how much you keep and the big thing is that you have to watch out for scams and things to watch out for and if you're gonna get into like hot storage wallets stuff like that there's a there's a video in the in the link of in the description of all my videos and it says you know things you the the big mistakes in crypto and it has like 20,000 views and of course it's the most important video I probably have ever put out because that's what people get screwed out and they get scammed out and if they watch that video they wouldn't happen to them another video I did when I'm gonna sell on my crypto has over 100,000 views so it just goes to show you like where the priorities are the priorities are make money but really the priority should be keep money someone's asking a um this the Market's not pricing it in right now but I did see like last night there's been a couple of times here where like there's at least some in investors like thinking about a rate hike um that is not like my base case at all like I think they're done I I think five and a half percent is the terminal rate for this cycle they might go higher next cycle uh but I I think five and a half percent at the top I'm not going to ask you if you think they're gonna hike again because I don't really think any of us think they're going to um if you do think that let me know but I guess my main question is what do you think would happen if they did hike again um because that be I mean that would talk about markets not pricing it in right I mean like I guess the the implication would be like if if the economy just accelerates into you know again and and there's not a cool down and we just keep on moving up uh what would a rate what would another rate hike do well what was real quick what was what is what has Jerome Powell said about fighting inflation do they say that they're on the right track or do they say like there's it's more more stubborn what he they've kind of like the progress has slowed a lot and I I think they've kind of specul that it it might influence their the number of rate Cuts this year because previously they had said three rate Cuts this year and I'm I'm wondering if they're starting to walk I mean now the market is pricing in only two rate cuts through April of 2025 so I my view is that you know I thought higher for longer but now that everyone else believes it I think I think it's going to go back the other way because once the market fully prices in no rate Cuts that's when people give up and you need to start having some rate cuts um but yeah I don't know I mean pal Po's basically said the same thing he said for the last three years if you know they're they're going to keep rates higher for longer until inflation's durably going back to 2% yeah I I think that 3% is is the new 2% truthfully I I I appreciate their narrative and their consistency and and how they haven't wavered on that and I think it's a great goal um but it seems like three is kind of a magnet actually a little above three um like you mentioned they are currently pricing in now it looks like you know our first 25 basis point cut on the uh September 18th meeting and then through April 2025 and and these percentages change all the time right uh you know we'll see what happens um you know potentially taking us down 50 basis points off of where we're currently at um let me answer your question what would happen if we got another 25 basis point hike because you know inflation decides it's going to rear its ugly head again and and start trending up above you know headline four 5% God forbid it's over I mean like we are going to absolutely nuke if we get another rate I'm gonna be as as clear as I can be if we get another rate hike markets are going to capitulate like that will be awful horrible for risk like sell all of your assets honestly like if that happens I'm not joking I think it'd be terrible I don't know if you guys agree with me but that would be horrible for markets but I don't think that's going to happen to be clear I think you could have the same thing happen if they just refuse to cut soon enough too because like it it you know like a tightening cycle is not just raising rates but it's also keeping rates too high for too long and the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and eight would have been in March um so we've already gone nine I think there's still you know there's still a window where talks about a soft Landing right it's so hard to thread that needle to a soft Landing because you have to stay high enough to make sure inflation doesn't come back in a second wave because if you don't and you get an inflation a secondary wave like the 70s you get a hard Landing but if you stay high for too long like let's say they stay at five and a half percent for another six months then you start to run the risk of of a deflationary crash right so that's why everyone sort of rolls their eyes about a soft Landing is because it's so difficult to thread that needle and I don't I do not envy their job I I do not envy their job because it's not and and they're also operating with long and variable lags like how can they know all the effects of prior monetary policy um so yeah it's it's a tough place for them to be and and we are oh sorry Rob go ahead no no go ahead Max I was going to say you know we are seeing some smaller economies in my opinion forecasting when our rate cuts are coming like we have seen the Czech Republic actually start to cut we've seen Poland cut um so it you know historically it's not perfect right but you are starting to see some of these smaller countries actually they they LED through the hik so they began to hike first they paused first and they've actually started to cut so I I do anticipate that you know in similar fashion to what has happened historically we will see the US begin to I guess cut rates hopefully uh later this year um but I do agree with you Ben like if they held rates where they're currently at through you know all of 2024 that would also put some pressure um on our economy and our markets but with that said like I don't know what you you guys think but I mean really the the final you know real dagger or Domino to fall is going to be of course unemployment creeping up above four four and a half percent do you guys think that if they just held rates where they're currently at all through 2024 um but we didn't see the labor market really deteriorate could financial markets hold up in that instance I mean if if the labor market doesn't deteriorate sure I just think that um I mean it seems like the unemployment rate is trending up um and the the problem with with that is that it doesn't tend to move in a linear fashion right it it goes slow and then it starts to accelerate at some point and we haven't reached the acceleration phase right so there's still a chance that we can avoid it but the longer they wait the the the riskier that's going to be I think I think there's a higher probability of a rate cut this summer than the market is giving credit for I don't think it has to happen this summer but I think the right thing to do is to cut at least 25 basis points uh this summer 50 basis points something like that just uh provide something you know are you thinking in the June meeting or July meeting I mean look last cycle I know that that the altcoin market was a lens into the consumer and I know that that when alts broke down against Bitcoin and when eth broke down against Bitcoin the FED basically cut one month later um and we we have seen eth fall against Bitcoin it had a weekly close below the June low we saw madic Bitcoin uh crash below it's June 2022 low we've seen adaa Bitcoin and Dot bit coin we've seen Litecoin Bitcoin and a Bitcoin I mean so many of these altcoins are are falling off their Bitcoin support levels and you can see it with the Bitcoin dominance so I think that the pricing out of all these rate Cuts is going to cause them to get priced in because the FED does not base their decisions on what our altcoins are doing right un they don't care what I what I what I find unfortunate is that a lot of the small like companies like Mom and Pop shops a lot of them are going out of business business right now because you know rates are going up and and and times are getting harder like inflation is so high so people just can't afford as much and but the FED has to do it because all of us Deens in the in the space can't help ourselves from bidding up jpegs you know and and and leading inflation uh to to where it was so I think that it's it's kind of a tough spot to be and the FED has to stay long enough to kind of break the animal spirits but if they do it too long then you then then you run the other issue of of a deflationary um unwind and that's not really fun either I know like people are like oh I'd love to go to the store and not spend as much money but if you if prices go down that's probably not good for risk assets terrible just yeah so everybody everybody who's watching the videos remember this when when you think like okay the Bitcoin Market or the crypto Market has to do this thing it has to do this thing because it's it's been the cycle that's always done this doesn't actually work like what we just talked about just how fragile the markets actually are and just to think how things have to really go in line before you realize that oh maybe I should have taken some profits when there was uh everything was overheated just it's just something to think about because I hate people who roundtrip and uh they really should again take some profits when everything gets too hot and and one thing just to mention about rate cuts and I mean you guys probably know this rate Cuts inherently are not bearish right it's it's the underpinning as to why they are cutting rates and you know if you actually on a granular level you go and you overlay the effective federal funds rate with you know the NASDAQ or S&P 500 markets actually tend to rally for like 30 to 60 days give or take following the First Rate cut until they wake up and they realize oh crap there's economic deterioration under the surface which is why they're cutting rates and then we see these major Corrections so I think whether the first 25 basis point comes in June or the end of July meeting or I guess hopefully September um that's probably your 30 to 60-day warning truthfully whenever it comes and I don't know when it will and what about no go ahead I was going to say you're right I mean like the rate Cuts inherently are are are bullish for risk assets if they're cutting for the right reasons in 2019 while Bitcoin topped out when rate Cuts arrived the S&P 500 kept going up and you know because the mark like the the economy was not in a recession right it wasn't going into a recession they were sort of like preliminary rate Cuts You could argue that Bitcoin is more tied to financial markets today traditional markets today than it was back then because of the spot ETF so maybe it would track the S&P 500 a bit closer than it did last cycle once rate Cuts arrive but the issue is why the FED is cutting are they cutting because they're trying to get ahead of something bad that's coming or are they cutting as a reactionary thing because they just saw a really bad labor market prance and that is is when they're not bullish like that's when rate cuts are be so it all depends on Max is right it all depends on why they're cutting and and I think that it's also risky to I I I do believe that there's just as much risk to the UPS side truthfully where you know assuming that they're going to cut because there is severe economic deterioration can also be you know a very harmful strategy long term because like you mentioned the first batch of rate cuts that we saw in 2019 um you know the S&P 500 rallied out of those cuts like 15% and then of course we had our Co nuke in March which took us below you know where that that first uh cut occurred right but you know again it's like you have to be very careful you kind of threading your own needle per se because just because they're cutting doesn't mean sell everything right because they could cut you know the labor market could be more resilient than anybody's expecting the S&P 500 could go up 50% over the next year and then something bad happens and you get a correction but that correction doesn't take you down to as low as the point in which the first cut happens so you just have to be a little bit careful truthfully you know you have to really understand why they're cutting and and it's a tough thing to do it's very tough I me with the S&P you know there there's been all sorts of like crises throughout all the decades but if you just pull up a chart over a 100 years I mean you know the the the overall trend is clear you know um the markets generally go up because the money supply yeah yeah you know why did prices of houses go up 40% because the supply of money went up 40 per. you know it's not it's not I it's not really that complicated so yeah no I mean I think like as always right like time in the market often beats time the market um because it's impossible to to actually time the market for under most circumstances and I think sometimes people get lucky with it and then assume that they're like a genius and can do it again and again and again um but the reality is that the market will humble us all at some point why don't we go ahead and wrap it up there um we we'll have NFA live back I guess next week next week I think it'll be on Rob's Channel um so we'll see you guys over there next week and again if you're not subscribed uh to to Max or Rob links for their channels are in the description below and uh we will see you guys next time

we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the having if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom the sale will be ending just after the having so make sure you check it out and lock in the lower rate let's go ahead and jump in the Bitcoin having is probably one of the most significant events in our industry I often find people debating every cycle you know whether the having is priced in or not whether it has an effect on pric or not my view is that you know we've had three having before we had one in 2012 one in 2016 and of course one in 2020 and I I certainly do think that the having does play a role in the cycles of the crypto verse um I also think that monetary policy plays a role but I don't really fall in either Camp completely I don't think that it's only based on supply side stuff and I don't think it is only based on you know monetary policy I think it's a combination of of different things markets are complex um they're they're based on a lot of different things and so because the having is one of the most important events I wanted to do a video where we talk about it and talk about where where I have previously said that theit the price of Bitcoin may be now price predictions are honestly something that I'm not super into um because usually you know usually price predictions don't really turn out that great if if you put in a price prediction and it goes above it then you know the comments aren't so nice and if you put a price prediction and we don't quite get there you know people are also upset but I wanted to to revisit something that I said four years ago and kind of see like where are we with respect to that so four years ago I put out this video Bitcoin Fair valuation at the next tabing in 2024 I put out this video in 2020 in May of 2020 the price of Bitcoin was around $8,000 and what I said back then was that if we follow the fair value logarithmic regression trend line then by the fourth having which is the having that's about to occur the price to bitcoin would be between 40 to $50,000 okay that's what I said back then clearly we are above that price right clearly if we go back and look at the video that I put out a year ago or no this was at the end of 2022 um or mid 2022 just before the the the um the final collapse occurred I also sort of Drew it out going to around a 40 to 50K so with Bitcoin right now at 63k it's ahead right I mean there's no denying it it's ahead of where I said it was going to be back then now of course back then putting out a price prediction four years later um and and hoping that it would be accurate at all was probably something I was fairly naive about uh but here we are 4 years later and the price of Bitcoin is actually above the target range that I put and it's also above this area that I put as well going into the having and so with that in mind I I want to discuss a couple of things that that may come up after the having um that could very well uh take some people by surprise now there's a lot of different thoughts to this current cycle with it being you know so hot at this point in the cycle we've never seen the market put in new highs before the having right this is the first time ever that Bitcoin has put in new highs before the having and so that was you know probably one of the reasons why back then I I didn't think it would be quite so high but we are at new highs before the having and so I just want to talk about what you know what to potentially expect after the happing now there's two different trends of thought here one of which is a left translated Peak okay now to be completely honest I'm not really in the left translated Peak camp but it does have like maybe 40% of my attention and the reason for that is if you were to take the ROI of Bitcoin from Peak to Peak and you take it from the April Peak Peak instead of the November 2021 Peak and you compare it to last cycle it sort of looks like it potentially could form into a peak sooner rather than later in which case you would get a left translated top meaning the the the actual top occurs way before anyone thinks it will historically Bitcoin has topped out in the fourth quarter of the post having year so if you look at Major Peaks that Bitcoin has had in the past if I were to get an arrow here you can see that this top was in Q4 of the post having year this one was in Q4 of the post having year and this one was in Q4 of the posst having Year we're currently in Q2 of the having year so you know that is is still about six quarters away when Bitcoin typically tops but again so far this cycle is anything but typical with Bitcoin putting in new before the having so if it is to translate into a left translated Peak a left translated cycle then it would be more likely that the top would occur in 2024 as opposed to 2025 if we are going to follow that then I have to imagine that we would follow potentially what happened last cycle now it's not really my base cas but again it would be foolish not to at least acknowledge the similarities but on the other hand where I would say 60% of my attention is right now is what if this cycle is just like prior cycles and we are all over here jumping through hoops trying to explain why this time is different when potentially it just Peaks when it normally does and one way that we could go about getting to that point would be that if we had a cool off in the summer okay now there's no guarantee and if we follow this path then you might see the exact opposite of a summer lull but if there is a summer lull then one thing to keep in mind when you look at the last two cycles as measured Peak to Peak you can see that at this point in the cycle Bitcoin was only up or it was it was actually still about 60% down from its all-time high now I want you to think about that for a minute in both prior Cycles at this point as measured Peak to Peak Bitcoin was 60% below the all-time high 60% below it now right now Bitcoin is not 60% below the prior high in fact 60% below the prior High would put Bitcoin all the way down at around $26,000 that's how accelerated we are this cycle look at the last cycle 60% down from that Peak you can see that by May of 2020 that was when the having occurred Bitcoin was down 60% from the high and then if you go back to the cycle before that this the that the having occurred in July if I remember correctly and if you go to July of 2016 you will see that Bitcoin was approximately down 60% from the high this having it's not right it's not 60% down from the high in fact it is at the high it's at the high which has never happened before so this has caused a lot of people to view this cycle as different from the prior ones and I have to tell you they make a fair point they make make a fair point and if you measure it from the April top you can kind of see that Bitcoin is doing just about what it always does at this point in the cycle if you take the April top as the more important top and of course there is evidence to suggest that the April top is the more important top for instance some of that evidence to suggest the April top is the more important top is to look at views to a lot of different cryptocurrency YouTube channels and to note that there were more views in the first half of 2021 than there were in the second half where Bitcoin basically just put in a lower high in terms of social activity but somehow a higher high in terms of price if you look at Bitcoin with respect to its 50e moving average one of the things that it does after every major cycle top is that it goes back down to the 50 we and then gets a bounce a dead cap bounce before ultimately capitulating we saw that happen over here as well go back to the 50 we get a dead bounce and then go all the way down this past cycle we did not see that exactly what happened was we went back to the 50 we and instead of it just being a dead cap bounce to a lower high which is what potentially that would have been we ended up getting a higher high which took a lot of people off guard now I was optimistic of a higher high but honestly I think because of for for wrong reasons you know and sometimes you get things right for the wrongs reasons and and it's important to take that into consideration so we can see that that happened right we can see that we went to the 50 we we got a bounce but that time it actually led to a higher high the even the intermediate bull market in 2019 had us bouncing off the 50 week at some point and so the 50 we today is at around 40K it's at 39.2k 39.3k which is interesting because again that is way below the current prices way below current prices and I have to imagine that if we do not evolve into a left translated top if we do not right so there's two op you know there's two options right we evolve into a left translated top where the peak occurs in 2024 or we evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 if we're going to evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 you really need to see Bitcoin cool off for a while and again as measured Peak to Peak you can see just how far quote unquote ahead of schedule this cycle is it's actually not that unfamiliar when you think about it the reason it seems like this time is different is because Bitcoin is at new all-time Highs but if you look at the last cycle there was a period where it too was well above its prior cycle but what eventually happened is it bled back down and basically got in line with the prior cycle and then still ended up showing diminishing returns okay and then it actually got ahead of that cycle again this is why a lot of people thought we were going to go to 300 K last cycle but it still was diminishing returns so I want to continue to put forth this idea that if we do not evolve into a left translated Peak sometime around the having and instead the market cools off going into the summer then you might just see something like this where it causes the cycle to just get back in line with prior Cycles now that of course could make a lot of people think that the cycle that the peak is over and and the Bull Run is is is completely done and and maybe they're right right but there is at least some evidence to suggest that that could be what is ultimately in store for us as we get lat into the cycle if you're not familiar with how the last cycle worked and why we what what happened when we bled back down here there's a number of things that really put Bitcoin back into a intermediate bare Market sort of you had a a quantitative tightening bull market and then a bare Market as rate Cuts arrived and then a QE bull market that topped in 2025 now take a a look at Bitcoin this cycle and see how it's doing something very very similar in the sense that it's had this major run during High interest rates you can see it's had this run during High interest rates and in fact if you were to look very closely at when the FED paused here and compare it to this you can see something very similar happened right it it fell just after the FED paused here it fell just after the FED paused and then it went up quite a lot but ultimately what happened is that it it found a local top as just before rate Cuts arrived and then it bled for a while before getting another bull run into the post having year now by the way the having is only four four days away so if we do come up and put in a new local high before the having or maybe around the having that still doesn't necessarily invalidate the idea of the market cooling off sometime after the having if the left translated Peak is not going to occur okay so again there's two thoughts you have a left translated Peak where us Deens just can't help ourselves and everyone just front run runs everything until until the consumer caves or the other idea which would support the idea of this time not being different would just for the cycle to get back in line now if the cycle gets back in line then maybe this view from four years ago of around a you know 40 to 50K Bitcoin by the fourth having isn't that far off I know right now if we were to go back to 40 to 50 okay it would probably feel like the world's falling apart for a lot of people but one thing to consider is that when when e I'm you know I don't know how I made it this far in the video without talking about it one thing to consider last cycle is that the 30% drop Bitcoin had pretty shallow drops during this QT bull market right pretty shallow drops and then eventually it finally got a 30% drop that 30% drop corresponded precisely to the point when eth Bitcoin broke down and eth Bitcoin just broke down below the summer 2022 low so if you were to get a 30% drop sometime after the having that would actually put you kind of right around that range that we said way back over here and in addition to that it would also get you Loosely backed in line with where the prior Cycles were so going into this Bitcoin having is certainly different in the sense that we've never seen a new all-time high before the habing if you were to go look at the risk metric of Bitcoin you will see that the risk on bitcoin has never been this High going into the having in fact the last time we went into the the the 20 when we went into the 2020 having the risk of Bitcoin was at 04 when you look at the 2016 having in July of 2016 the risk on bitcoin was 0.4 today the Bitcoin risk is6 so it's actually quite a bit higher than it was during the last two 3 to4 this time we find ourselves at 639 and only a few weeks ago the risk was in the 7 to8 risk band to give you an idea of what the 04 risk band would look like which is where we were going into the last two that's where the 04 to 0.5 wristband is that's where the price of Bitcoin was at the last two Habs and you can see actually that Bitcoin when those rate Cuts arrived right here had that correction back to the 100 we moving average now what's fascinating about that is that it would correspond to the prior breakout zone so I I I feel like there's two different ways that we can look at the market here here that make the most amount of sense number one is that this is not different from the prior cycles and we're kind of on track with where we should be and that could be viewed by maybe looking at the ROI after the after the low if you look at the ROI after the low and you compare this cycle with two cycles ago this is exactly where we were but you can see that it at this point it did cool off for a while and then did get a drop kind of um you know this was day 520 or so about you know a month and a half from now or so so you can view it like that or you can view it from the peak and still say we're where we should be based on uh based on measuring it from the April top right if you take this out Peak to Peak if you measure it from the April top we're pretty much where we should be but again I can't help but think are we are we are we doing the same thing again where everyone tries to come up with a reason for why this time is different but in reality it's not so my thought process on the matter is this as we go into the Bitcoin having if Bitcoin accelerates into the having and post having and into June right if it is something like that where you know over here in 2019 in fact before rate Cuts arrived it actually did rally in until June last year we had a a local top in April but then we swept the high in June if we get something like that where Bitcoin continues to go up throughout the summer then I would be more in tune with the idea of a left translated top where you get a top in 2024 as opposed to say 2025 however on the other hand if you get a low Top by Bitcoin here as rate Cuts arrive and then instead of you know and that could still include sweeping the prior high right but if you get a look kind of like we did over here with the spot ETF we we put in a new high on the day of the spot ETF for the cycle if on the other hand we see the market cool off into the summer and go to say the 04 to 0.5 wristband or even the 0. 3 to point4 wristband and we get the market more back in line with the prior two cycles then I I think that perhaps the base case should still be that the cycle is playing out just as it always has and you still could get a top in in late 2025 and in fact it was this very intermediate bare Market that kind of scared a lot of people off in fact what happens if something like that happens again where rate Cuts arrive and you go back down scares a lot of people off and then because everyone gets scared off the FED starts printing money again and then you get a QE bow Market I've said this before and I'll say it again there's two types of bull markets in crypto there's quantitative tightening bull markets that occur during periods when the FED is lowering reducing the assets on their balance sheet that's what we got in 2019 and that's what we've got over here and during those periods during those periods eth Bitcoin goes down eth Bitcoin goes down during QT quantitative tightening bull markets how many people for the last couple of years have said that eth outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market that's not true not without any disclaimer because as you can see bitcoin's been going up since late November of 2022 and eth Bitcoin has been going down the entire time so that is why I still think there is some evidence to suggest the cycle may play out like it always does rather than a left translated top I'm not completely unsympathetic to the idea of a left translated Peak there's a lot of really smart people out there that frankly provide a compelling case for it and I could honestly provide a compelling case for it I just showed you guys some of the different charts but if Bitcoin does not run into the highest wristbands the 0. N to one wristband this summer and instead it just cools off like it did back over here after the having it might scare a lot of people off but perhaps it's just doing what it did last cycle and it the only reason that the top the local the midcycle top came later was because rate Cuts came later this cycle than they did last cycle so you have quantitative tightening bull markets where Bitcoin goes up as e Bitcoin bleeds all Bitcoin pairs bleed and then you have QE bull markets that go where Bitcoin goes up as eth Bitcoin goes up so eth outperforms Bitcoin in a QE Market but not a QT Market there's two different different types of bull markets so that is a very important distinction and I think we've only received more and more evidenced over the last year that Bitcoin really is dependent somewhat on monetary policy because last September when eth Bitcoin came back down to to this area right here there were there were a lot of people that thought that it had bottomed because that's when it had bottomed in the last cycle Q3 of the pre having year this development here which is what I said was likely going to happen this development of the the devaluation of eth against Bitcoin shows that the market is very much dependent on monetary policy whether we want to believe it or not so if that is the case right if that continues to be the case then you very well could see a a repeat of what happened over here sort of an intermediate Lull in the market followed by because of rate Cuts right that occur during rate Cuts followed by the last rate cut which leads to a QE bull market where you maybe top out when you normally do in the latter part of the post tapping year so two different theories if you're new here that's what is you know has really been discussed over the last uh year or so is this cycle different is it not I honestly think if you if you have a bias on it you're going to find the evidence that you're looking for um I I think we we'll know soon enough we we'll know soon enough if Bitcoin cools off into the summer which it very well could we we've seen gold breakout just like it did in mid 2019 we've seen eth Bitcoin break down just like it did in mid 20 M mid 2019 all Bitcoin pairs still haven't broken down yet but if it cools off into the summer then it just seems like it's the same thing as last cycle it's just that the the midcycle top was nine months later about about n nine months later if on the other hand after the having Bitcoin just accelerates to the upside once again then I will have to uh I will probably say that there's more Merit to the idea of of a left translated top but that's what I'm looking at right now and so to just revisit my prediction back in 2020 what would be the fair value of Bitcoin at the fourth having of 40 to 50k I find myself today seeing a $64,000 Bitcoin 4 days before the having and I I can't think I can't help but think to myself wow back then when I made that prediction I thought it was a lofty prediction that frankly was maybe not you know not that likely to come true because you know when Bitcoin is at 8K and and it really hadn't done anything for a couple of years I wasn't really that optimistic um of of you know exactly how accurate this prediction would be come to find out I was too conservative potentially right I was too conservative so it just goes to show how difficult these markets are to predict um four years ago price of Bitcoin was at 8K I said fourth having 40 to 50 instead we find ourselves at 64 and what's fascinating to me is that if we were at 40 to 50K I think it would you know a lot of people would think the the world's falling apart when in reality that would have been what the fair value sort of suggested it would be and that chart that chart that you see in that video is just this chart right here um these regression bands here so at the last taing we were at the fair value that's the other thing that why I said 40 to 50K back then because at every prior having Bitcoin was at the fair value so in no the fit to non-bubble data so in November 2012 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to non-bubble data in July of 2016 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to quote unquote non-bubble data in May of 2020 Bitcoin was at its fair value fit to again quote unquote non bubble data theoretically I should have updated this chart because it does I think need to get updated every cycle I haven't really done it yet if I did update it it would just shift it down very very slightly but right now according to this chart the fair value is around um 52k 52k but if you if you were to refit it based on this data over here it would actually probably put the fair value somewhere between 40 to 50K which is why I said back over here like we'll have to refit it um and and it'll be around 40 to 50K so we're above that level right now if on the other side of the having or something we see that level just know that that is is is what the um you know the regression band would have ultimately suggested for this part of the cycle so those are my thoughts going into the Bitcoin having we will see what happens uh as the having comes around it's only four days away and and we will do an update in maybe a month or so we'll see what happened you know after the having if we just contined to rally on into a left translated top or if it cools off like 2019 and and we just kind of come back down and and cool off until until the last rate cut arrives if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs

The Bitcoin Halving' by 'Benjamin Cowen' released on 2024-04-18 00:00:00\\nvideo url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS-ramvvRFU\\n\\nHi, this is NFA live this should be a relatively exciting show for two reasons first of all we have the Bitcoin having coming up in just about a day and we also have a new guest with us today Max from because Bitcoin uh how you doing great thanks so much for having me Ben yeah and you started you started doing this a year or two ago is that right yeah probably about 18 months ago officially yep all right yeah so max is um I've known him basically since probably before he even started the YouTube channel or right around the time that he started it uh so make sure you guys go subscribe to him and Rob as well uh links to that are in the description below so make sure you guys check that out and we're just going to go through a lot of the different questions that I think would probably be on people's minds as we go into the having uh so let's just go ahead and jump in Rob we'll start with you on this one the having is tomorrow it's tomorrow we've been waiting forever here it is fourth having um and I'm guessing it's going to garnish some attention should be making some headlines different places I'm curious what what effects do you think the having will have on the larger crypto space um do you think it'll bring new eyes to the scene or are we still kind of just uh you know the same old same old people just kind of hanging out um do you think it'll it'll actually bring new new people to the space uh we saw a lot of new people come to the space last cycle sometime after the having um or do you think it'll be quiet for a while and do you see any narrative shifts after the Havoc that's a pretty loaded question first of all I would just like to say that Max has a great background I'm sure he got to the same place I did which is fivr and uh hopefully he didn't get ripped off but it looks great and uh I gotta tell you one of these days max we're gonna have to put that into an nft just me and you so yeah yes that is my old green screen but I'll be jumping in that green screen as soon as the uh as the Bitcoin hits 100K But to answer Ben's question which I think is is what uh everybody wants to really try to figure out is this Bitcoin having and I know like there's a lot of first of all that I still believe in the fouryear cycle some people say that it doesn't really register I still and some people will talk like Bob Lucas will say well it's just left translated and we're going to see a big blowoff top in 2024 which could very well happen but I still think that the narrative around it and there's still a lot of people say well there's Mass adoption coming and it's already here I still think it's I mean I don't think that we're at the same level like we should be and what we could be in like 2028 or 2032 or you know time comes up but Ben if you get to show my my screen real quick because everyone wants to know like well the Bitcoin having and you did a great I I watched your your video Ben about uh uh the ethereum evaluation ethereum ethereum valuation of Bitcoin about how you know Bitcoin dominance is going up and how it's wreaking havoc and it's true it is right now I know people will will also talk about you know like hey well you know these things happen leading up to the having but if we take a look back this is from Smart Valor it's a good website and if we take a look they did all the work for him which is great this is how Bitcoin behav in the year leading up to each having because we had one of course in 2012 2016 then 2020 and I know people will say well there's always a dip there's always this massive dip before the having and there could be I mean we saw one pretty massive one in 2020 but of course there's a reason for that and and we could either say like it's because of the of the almighty Corona virus or it was something else but yeah there was a dip in 2016 but again just take a look at this so with having with the having one in 2012 the year leading up to the having it went up to 385 per. and the year after of course because we always see alltime highs the year after so far it went up 5,000% having two in 2016 leading up to it 142% now there's dips along the way and we're seeing that right now but then a year after that in 2017 2 84% in 2020 even though there was a turbulent year like we talked about it was still up 17% for the year getting into that having in May I think it was May 12 2020 and then it went up almost five almost 600% the year after that and we can see here that that yeah same thing happened the year leading up to to the having on November 208th 2012 this is what Bitcoin was 250 and then of course we come up and then you can see right here that yes there is a a drop before that and then it comes up and there's a drop before but it's like the same thing as like a bull market so we're seeing the same thing kind of Replay I know it's a funny thing because like Ben you'll say like uh you say hey I I I told you that the Bitcoin ethereum evaluation was going to start to start to lose momentum or actually bleed away to ethereum and then people were going to blame a Black Swan event and they never would have saw it coming but here we are and again same thing happens here 2015 a year going into it yes it's not a straight line but we kind of I mean really rallied into it there's you know dips along the way but I mean it's going in that right direction and then of course 2019 to 2020 we started at 7325 we had it kind of flat and then we saw the almighty Corona virus right here but then we rallied into it so I still feel like the same thing's gonna Happ happen that's just how I see things and I'm I'm feeling pretty good about this having so far but the big question is and and we we'll talk about this later is what's the macro is there going to be quantitative easing or more quantitative Tiding are they actually going to cut rates are we going to have the liquidity that we absolutely need which we had beforehand even though we're in quantitative uh tightening right now I mean we still rallied pretty well but can we get that liquidity back in the market and that's I think that's the big question on top of the fact of are we going to see World War II so yeah that's where I got yeah it's interesting because you know at some point you would think we would need to make the shift from quantitative tightening to quantity to quantitative easing but what needs to trigger that shift is the is the is the thing that I I think we're kind of wrestling with um someone asked where a guy was I I should have mentioned that he's he's in Dubai and I mean there's obviously a lot of stuff going on right there going on right now there with the conference and um everything so he wasn't able to make it this week um so um Max I I'll put the same question to you I mean like what are your thoughts here on the Bitcoin having um is this just kind of the same old thing that we've seen before and everyone's trying to over complicate it uh do you see any kind of shifts coming after after the having what are your thoughts yeah I I would agree with the with the last part I think that a majority of people and it's very easy to do this I I tend to do it all the time is to sort of chronically over complicate something that has for over a decade now been a pretty reliable uh we'll just we'll call it a risk on event and in the simplest of terms all you need to do is you know pull up your trading view chart and Mark out every single Bitcoin having right you need at this point you know you need to draw four vertical lines whenever a Bitcoin having has occurred look at the the price action that has basically come almost immediately following so um you know I I try to look at this thing from Every Which angle you know I look at it from the side I look at it up side down I you know I try to include the macro and and fed policy in all of my decisionmaking but um you know the truth of the matter is this is a very unique time to be in the markets right Bitcoin is now on the global stage in my opinion for the first time um there is you know new on-ramps into crypto you know specifically being these you know nine ETFs um and it is you know there's more regulatory Clarity the accounting standards have shift did in a positive light and are working to you know become more friendly for corporations and big money to actually onboard into this digital commodity if they choose to do so um but again like Rob had mentioned and Ben like you commented on there also are some macro headwinds which can only be ignored for so long unfortunately I am of the belief that we do still have some time I believe we're maybe on borrowed time some people probably don't like to hear that but but I do believe that there is this this unique pocket of time where it's all coming together and we can really see risk perform um positively of course I don't have to tell you guys this and I probably don't have to tell the audience this but historically during a Fed pause until something has quote unquote kind of broken and we see Unemployment uh you know trending above 4% and the FED actually has to step in and begin easing through you know interest rate cuts and other measures um we can actually see risk you know being stocks and now crypto performed tremendously well and you know going back to you know to the last cycle you know we actually kind of went through a little mini fed cycle here and you know 2018 2019 and 2020 um you know where Bitcoin actually the floor kind of gave out we dropped to about 3K and then we had that famous rally into June of 2019 when we topped um you know there was actually hikes going into that and then of course right as Bitcoin basically topped in June of 2019 the FED began to actually cut rates um more or less right after that and it did dramatically affect Bitcoin some will say you know it was a reflexivity and you know we had to you know we we sprung hard off of that local floor so you know of course the market corrects to the downside some will say it's covid some will say it was in the charts the whole time some will say it's not I don't know you know nobody knows whether it would have happened with Co or or without um but again I don't think that this time really is that much different I think that every cycle has some distinct differences from from a previous one I mean for example last cycle we had a double top we haven't had a true double top before we have had a cycle like the 2013 one where we had you know two pronounced Peaks but a true double top had never happened before and additionally in the bare Market we had never spent as much time below the 200 WEA as we just did coming out of this most recent bear so there are you know of course Very recognizable and notable differences of every cycle but you to answer the question Point Blank I don't think that this time is much different and I I'm trying my best to not overthink it um and say you know what there is no reason for the FED to intervene at this point we're trending in that direction and we are on borrowed time there is a Day of Reckoning coming but I do believe at the earliest it's probably sometime in Q4 we have the having you know in less than two days and I do believe that there's plenty of room for risk to run in the short to Middle term maybe going out six months okay yeah no I mean it's great to get you guys opinions um and the market has been on an absolute tear I mean essentially after since October right I mean it was pretty boring summer last year but then since October uh the market has basically just been up only up until the last few weeks but um you know the next thing I'd like to talk about is of course Rob's absolutely favorite topic and it's of course Bitcoin dominance um and you know I you know you guys know My Views but I always like to get other other views because you know I'm I it's it's a good idea not to live in an echo chamber so Bitcoin dominance has once again broken a new highs I I we saw 57% actually it came really really quickly really quickly you know that that move to 57% it's kind of cooled off back you know it's back down to like the 55 like 55 and a half or so so it has cooled off quite a bit since that rally up to 57% uh so uh Max I'll start with you first on this one do you think it's going to keep going up after the having um you know it was it it was going up into the spot ETF and then it kind of waned a little bit following the spot ETF but then it just kind of picked right back up so what do you think is gonna happen this time and and this kind of goes to the whole like the last question as well like will there be a narrative shift and what people are focused on will they will they start focusing on more things besides you know sticking with Bitcoin um do you see you know what are your thoughts on that Max well first I have to give you a compliment Ben because you were one of the few people that with a big following publicly called Bitcoin dominance rallying to this point I didn't expect it to get up to I think it topped at what 57 recently or wherever did you you deserve a lot of credit for that well I'm known for riding Trends too long see well we'll see right nobody knows besides the market right like you know we we all have our our inclinations but uh you deserve a lot of credit because I remember months and months AG I don't it was probably six months ago plus we did a space together or you came on on my my channel because Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance was significantly lower and eth BTC was significantly higher and much has changed since then so kudos to you where do I think it goes from here so I think that Bitcoin dominance is in the process of we'll call it distribution okay I believe believe that the meat of the move is over um but that does not preclude it from going a little bit higher than here maybe maybe 60% that's not my base case but you know let's let's look left on the chart and you know use that to you know maybe forecast what could happen next so ignoring the you know whether this is a left translated cycle or an expedited cycle let's look at it contextually for where Bitcoin is at um you know from from a a p perspective right so Bitcoin actually has gone on to get above the previous cycle all-time high of 69k so most comparably again ignoring everything else but just pure levels on the chart pure you know where was the cycle High where was the cycle low you could probably compare Bitcoin right now to like December of 2020 okay if we just ignore everything else and say okay Bitcoin in December of 2020 went on to sweep the previous cycle all-time high of 197 it paused there for what maybe a month or or something like that it was chopping around altcoins got destroyed during that time right Bitcoin uncertainty like you always preach Ben uh when Bitcoin is uncertain alts get absolutely eviscerated and we are seeing that once again right so um again comparing this period of time to December of 2020 there is turbulence under the previous cycle all-time high which is not uncommon we saw that again last cycle and then also two cycles ago it seems to be sort of the same thing happening again what did we see in December of 2020 well what we saw was Bitcoin dominance basically put in a deviation or bull trap High where on when Bitcoin finally decided it was time to push through with conviction above the previous cycle all-time high of 197 you saw Bitcoin dominance put in an explosive move which ultimately ended up being sort of a bull trap you know for for the Bitcoin Maxis um so I I think it's possible we are seeing that Devi that deviation high right now only time will tell um I do have hedges in place you know like I'm I'm holding some Bitcoin l2s like STX and some Bitcoin ordinals and things like that that I think would be beneficiaries of you know Bitcoin dominance continued rally maybe above 60% um but of course you know I I really I am of the belief that contextually with Bitcoin chopping under the previous cycle all-time high seeing similar signs of Bitcoin dominance putting in you know this this last explosive push I do believe that over the next six months or so it would probably makes sense to see Bitcoin dominance Trend down dramatically and additionally and and I don't mean to you know bring this up because I don't know if this is on the agenda today exactly I imagine that that would translate to eth BTC finding a bottom sooner rather than later but that doesn't again preclude it from going down a little bit more and only time will tell yeah no I mean it's great and I mean I I I think it's always worthwhile to hear these other views because um you know no one really knows right I mean you know no one really knows and you know one thing that I've wrestled with a lot before and I've seen other people do this too is like you know just because someone gets something right doesn't mean they're going to be right they're going to keep being right right and also just because someone gets something wrong doesn't mean they're GNA be keep being wrong I mean you know markets change no one knows what's going to happen and I I I could see eth Bitcoin carving out a bottom this summer um that's kind of my base case I could see that actually happening so we'll see if that happens Rob what are your thoughts I mean I know you're you're more of a you're more of a Bitcoin Maxi yourself right Bitcoin dominance to 100% I yes exactly go ahead Ben what was your question I'm just kidding I'm just kidding what what are your thoughts here on on on dominance do you think it's uh you think we're getting pretty close to the uh to the top well first of all let me just say that I I I was like listening to to Max especially on like the Twitter spaces and things like that he's very smooth in his delivery and very smart and and what he talks about so I gotta tell you it's good to hear like different sets of opinions it's great to have a Max here so to talk about I mean Bitcoin dominance I got to tell you like when you were talking the 60% I'm like yeah you know I can kind of see it you know I was I was I was under the assumption like well you know it always kind of comes back that way right something happens there's something that happens in the market a Black Swan event or you know something that's just that kind of has disruption and then people get scared and they're they're like okay I'm risk on but not that risk on to go into like you know Pepe coin I'm gonna go into the safest asset in the most volatile industry which would be Bitcoin and I I could see that for sure but then like there's a narrative that that people are always talking about especially in in in the crypto space being the Bitcoin maxos are going to say Bitcoin only right but there are narratives that are out there one of those is dpin Right centralized physical infrastructure Network the other one are dexes because we see what's going on with the centralized exchanges getting sued getting their pants sued off by the SEC and then leaving of course so we have to have dexes and then of course there's another big one which is web 3 so we talk about that but there's one that I feel is on an undertone and Max alluded to it when he was talking about it when he talked about runes and he talked about ordinals and he talked about things like stacks and l2s and I think what's gonna really push Bitcoin dominance up I know Ben loves this part too is uh the the l2s or even l1s that are going to be built on bitcoin Ben if you just throw this this chart up I always talk about this website it's l2. watch so imagine this and I and and and even like Adam back has talked about this how he's talked about he hates the fact that everybody's building off of Bitcoin people should just build on bitcoin because he says it's like it's it's like the tcpip layer for for the internet so why can't they just build on the most the safest most secured Network or computerized Network ever built in the entire world and he was right so when I take a look at these these l2s that are coming out and they're all new so you I to understand like this some most of these are trash let's just let's just call it SP Spade but like when we talk about things that are coming out that are actually doing pretty good like a Stax who's been around for quite some time I can really see things actually happening for sure and then like I just dropped a a video on my second Channel where I talked about core core is a top uh 50 well it's 56 now but it's essentially an L1 L2 type of uh uh token which is built right on top of Bitcoin using delegated proof of work and delegated proof of stake together to actually make dexes nfts and a whole host of things you can only do with smart contracts so when I see stuff like this happening I'm like why can't we take away the nonsense that's going on over in ethereum world and they're massive gas fees like just like with with core and stacks right now if you use it or the things that are being built on top of it they're just going through their Satoshi initiative it's super cheap and it's super fast so for me to see that Bitcoin dominance could go up why couldn't it especially with the different institutions that are here and how they've been drilled into it now they can say oh there's something else I can do and also smart I see it could actually go above 60% but again I'm not always right no I mean I I've it's possible it's certainly possible um I think the answer is going to probably come in the next few weeks because you know there's two prior examples where we had these kind of these like closes below the 8we ese 2021 and 2019 and in 2021 after it happened Bitcoin got a rally eth Bitcoin went up but in 2019 when Bitcoin got that rally eth Bitcoin went down so I think if we see Bitcoin get some type of relief I don't know maybe sometime after the having into may I I don't know exactly when it would be but whenever that comes whatever happens to eth bitcoin should be very telling about where we are in the cycle so I I'm going to be focused a lot on that um over the next few weeks but we will see um next question Rob I'm GNA start with you on this one to rotate and you know I remember last year you saying something like this um and and you ended up being correct it was basically you know sell and man go away um like I mean no one's D Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear since October I mean you know I mean it was basically like 25 to 30k not even that long ago um and I I think sometimes we forget just how quickly it has moved so I'm curious like do you think it's going to be similar to last summer where we just get the market gets boring before maybe moving up again like later in the year or something you think it's just going to get boring for a few months um do you think or on the other hand do you think everyone's gonna get think it's boring and then we just get another you know face what's it called like a face melting Rally or something that's exactly face yeah I mean like so so what are your thoughts going into the summer because I mean again I know last summer you you thought it was going to be boring do you think it's going to be boring again this summer or you think it's going to be different Matt well first of all I I hope so I I really do because everybody who's in the chat right now answer a question for me uh tell me if you think that you've accumulated enough where you're like you know what I've bought plenty of Bitcoin and I just cannot handle any more bags I just I don't want to buy anymore especially if it goes down and gets cheaper just let me know in the comment section because it seems like when these types of things Ben when you say things are boring this is great because this is when people who like the dollar cost average is fantastic or if you're Dynamic DCA is things go down which I think where we at the risk levels now 0.6 0.59 somewhere around there a little yeah I think a little above 0 six so like if we're in this place we're like well I mean for me this is a good time to just accumulate a little bit but as we start to like if it goes sideways well great I have more time to bring things in but then if you if you want to talk about selling May and go away there's this great chart on this website that I steal from constantly and if you just take a look because it's it's yeah it's a nice website it's very nice I think there's a sale going on until like tomorrow and then it goes away so but if if you say sell in May and go away it it actually works out pretty well I mean historically speaking but then if you really want to break it down because people say but Rob you don't get it because this is the having year so it's all it doesn't really it count well if you take a look at it I mean if you sold at the end of May of 2020 I mean you had a 30% increase on January a couple of drops there 34 and 10% and then you're down here and you just kind of stay away until October and then you buy in and then October rallies November rallies and December rallies that's not bad I mean I'll take that year right and if we go back to 2016 I mean it's the same type of thing if I want to sell in May okay well June's gonna go up but I have red red I take I stay away September as well and I I buy back in October November December I'm doing pretty good so I still think it can work out all right the thing that you have to understand though and one more thing is is this there's a presidential election I think this is going to be pretty tumultuous as we get into it so there was this piece from hbk's wealth and it talked about the presidential election years versus the non-election as far as returns and this is just taking a look at the S&P 500 you can see that in the presidential election years which this is that year it sends to like kind of peek off around March April and then just kind of fall away until we get into junisha may go away October is here you buy back in and then we have a nice little rally of course drop here and then off we go but 10% for that year is not too bad now does that mean that I'm going to sell everything no no I'm just telling you these are just the data points that we can say take a look at me personally I'm just here to accumulate and uh get into some early round type of cryptos that could either make a lot of money or go to zero one of those two will always happen yeah I was looking at this um this is uh this is the S&P 500 in 2024 compared to the average of all election years right I mean so you can see like it has come down a lot recently but it also went up a lot too like way more than it does on average so there's just been a lot more volatility this cycle than I think we've seen in a lot of Prior Cycles um but yeah I I thought that was interesting and that chart sort of reminded me of that uh Max what are your thoughts here I mean I know earlier you said you expected uh risk to do pretty well um over the next six months but you know even with that do you think that the market could cool off before that phase or do you think it's not going to really get much of a breather or do you think the Breather is almost over yeah that's it's a it's a great question of course we're all from relatively familiar with the uh maybe cliche but overused but also kind of accurate saying of sell and may go away um one thing that I've been preaching for a while going back to I mean even I would say Q4 of last year is that I was seeing signs early on of a maybe expedited cycle for crypto um and it's probably off of of you know the back of this this fed paw and there isn't quite as much in my opinion economic deterioration as a lot had thought myself included and we're in this you know kind of Goldilocks window where risk can rally really unencumbered um you know so so do I think that selling may go away will come to fruition I I would think that worst case in my opinion from what I'm seeing right now and again of course subject to change it's just one man on the internet's opinion I think that similarly to how this cycle for crypto is being a little bit front Rand and we've actually seen for the first time a Bitcoin all-time high before a having which of course had never happened before um I also think it's possible that selling may go away is being front ran a little bit and we're seeing that right now with this April correction so similarly to Rob I am not I am not in the camp of you know drisking or selling spot because again like I mentioned in you know during our first question here if you just draw four vertical lines on your trading View and Mark out every Bitcoin having look what typically happens in the six to nine months following Additionally you know for a lot of us that have been slowly you know and thoroughly meticulously dcing into our digital digital assets and our unregistered Securities over the past year you know a lot of us have tax consequences for selling right now and I'm I'm not really interested in incurring any uh you know tax consequences trying to reposition because May perhaps is a little bit choppy so in my opinion you know and again going back you know the past 18 months for Bitcoin we haven't seen more than a 22% correction on bitcoin so from our local high recently take it down 22 to 25% maybe you get 57 56 worst case that's not enough for me to incur you know a taxable event to try to reposition so uh maybe it happens maybe it doesn't but for me ultimately it doesn't make a big difference because the having is in a couple days um and typically what happens after a having is months and months of prosperity and hopefully price discovery yeah no it's a fair point I mean I think like all the corrections that we've had by Bitcoin for the entire bull market have only been about 20 to 22% yeah we've already seen it go down about what 18% or so um so that I think that'll be the the area I mean if we get down there see if it turns around and if it does maybe the time's not different you know but yeah what do you think Ben do you think selling May and go away will come to ahead um I think now I mean so I so we went into the 7 to point8 risb in March so that I think was the time to to drisk some kind of like during the spot ETF um at this point it's kind of like when we went back to 39K after the spot ETF um we then it was it was a 22% drop and then we just rallied after it right and and so I was like you know this could be our preh having year dip and then the rally just continued and so now it's kind of the same thing it's like you know the the area to do it if you were convinced about it would have been in in March you know um when gold broke out because that's actually in 2019 when Bitcoin topped was when gold broke out um so I think that would have been the time to do it now I do think there is a risk of if you've waited if you've waited till this point and now bitcoin's down 20% we did see both in after the 20209 or the 2019 top and the 2021 top the first weekly close bow of the 8we SMA we then had a rally back up you know to the we right which is around 67k we actually went slightly above it in both cases so I think what what's more important is not exactly what happens here at the range lows but it's what happens whenever we get a relief move does it sustain or does it just put in a lower high I think that is kind of the thing to look for because back in after the spot ETF it wasn't a lower high we just you know had another face ripping rally fire um the the reason why I am more cautious on this one than than the last one is because eth Bitcoin has now broken down and gold is broken out which both of those events marked the 2019 local top and it wasn't the market cycle top and this kind of goes back to what Rob was saying you know there is this idea of a left translated peak in 2024 and I can sort of like I'm like 30% maybe 40% aware of that like you know thinking hey this is this could actually happen you know if if we were to Rally into the summer to higher prices without cooling off then I would be very more so convinced of a left translated Peak but what if what if if you think about what happened after the 2019 top after gold broke out and after e Bitcoin broke down Bitcoin went into a six to n month bare Market in fact now imagine you get that after the having and everyone thinks the cycle is over by the end of 2024 because it just hasn't done anything since the having and then we just get another move in 2025 and then the cycle Peaks when it always does and once again everyone over complicated it you know like there is a chance that that that happens um so I would I think I would just watch to see what happens whenever we get any type of relief does it form into a lower high or does it lead to a higher high and then you probably have your answer to whether it's a left translit cycle or not at that point I can see absolutely yeah and again even in 2019 it was it was just a local top we bled for a while we actually bled back to the 100 we SMA um and then and then we started to go back back up and then we had the we had the pandemic crash but if you ignore that it was just sort of a bleed after all Bitcoin pairs broke down and then and then once we got that back you know we start to go back up those are my and and by the way I mean you've always said this going back when you know before I started my business and I was watching all of your videos you know years ago Ben you used to always say something kind of along the lines of you know the longer it takes you know the higher will ultimately go something along those lines and you know I think a uh this idea of a prolonged sort of midcycle Correction freaks a lot of people out because everybody wants to be rich overnight myself included right of course i' I'd love for us to just go straight up in a straight line and I hope that we do but ultimately I don't think it would be a death sentence for Bitcoin to kind of reestablish value between 55 and 75k for even a full quarter um you know I think ultimately would probably lead to more constructive uh price action to the upside in the long run but people you know their patients will be tested no question yeah yeah I mean I think the the the thing to look for in the cycle I think is is the Bitcoin dominance I I really do think it's the key for the cryptoverse and I think I think that dominance will Top before Bitcoin Falls below the 20we SMA that's my guess is that it's going to top before Bitcoin Falls below it and I think between now and then Bitcoin gets occasional rallies that just take off Bitcoin pairs even lower is my guess um so that's why I just say like you know if you want exposure to crypto Bitcoin I mean you know Bitcoin is is a relatively safe bet if you want to take on more risk there's obviously the altcoin market there's the full DJ mcoin Market um but you have to be careful with those and I I I think the winning strategy with the altcoin market and and even if you are in the riskier memec coin stuff is just to remember like in five years that Meme coin is probably not going to exist No One's Gonna care about it because they're going to be worried about the next stage of mean points right so the way the way to navigate it is it's okay to have exposure to various parts if you want to take more risk but just occasionally convert it back to bitcoin if you make a lot of money right because at least you know you then know hey Bitcoin is still going to be around in 10 years I don't know if this random meme coin is Ben how could you say that how dare you my a meme coins oh my I think I've converted most of my audience to bitcoin Maxis at this point but I will say by the time I convince the last person to be a Bitcoin Maxi that's when the dominance tops out and we go back the other way I don't think we're that far away I think maybe this summer dominance tops out we'll see though but you are correct like what anybody out there like if we're being completely honest Would You Bet Your Life that Your Meme coin or your altcoin is going to be around in 50 years would You Bet Your Life on it I probably would not would I bet my life I mean it's an extreme example right would I bet my life or something valuable that Bitcoin will be around bet your would you bet all your money on it or something right that's much more friendly right so and I would for Bitcoin I have a high degree of confidence and that's why your strategy ultimately it's conservative you know relative to a lot of other people that you know talk about crypto publicly but it is ultimately a long-term winning strategy and people need to recognize that profits from altcoins ultimately do have to flow back into Bitcoin that is the sustainable strategy for sure yeah I mean I think Rob I think Rob was talking about this what last week on NFA live we were talking about like what do you do when you get an airdrop and I think what was your strategy like just 50% you take profits on it right away 50% back to bitcoin or USD and then you let there oh no no it was you let let it go up 2X or something or if it goes up 2x then you sell 50% was that what you said yeah I I call it well two things I call it the half and half method so you get into meme coins or something crazy and then let's say you put it you know 100 bucks in and then it goes $200 so then you sell half immediately and you put the other hundred bucks let it ride because that's house money then when it doubles or triples or or quadruples then you take half again or you take two or three or 4X what do you want to do and then you let the ride and you do that until there's no more riding and it just goes away and then you're like well okay I I did 8X but it went to zero so I don't feel so bad because a lot of people just let it go all the way up and all the way down but if you just play with house money there's a reason why like like I I can see people in the in the chats going well this sucks because you know now we're gonna sideways and you know this isn't what I want to be there's a reason why all three of us are pretty much just like on all of our videos on all of our Twitter spaces we're pretty much the same person whether it goes massively up or way way down me's a little bit of excitement but it's because we der risked enough to like well if this happens then we do this if this happens we do that and I think that's where people should would want to be as opposed to just going okay I sold my kidney I hope this memec coin goes up it's one of those things have a plan no matter what and then enjoy your life don't stress about it right I mean have a plan like you know if Bitcoin goes to 50K or even lower so what have a plan if it goes up have a plan I mean it I I think you know I used to navigate crypto without without thinking about like what do I do if this happens I only would navigate it based on one particular outcome I never hedge myself but once I started hedging My Views then it makes things easier you know you're like all right well this is what I think but if I'm wrong I don't want to be you know completely left out of whatever that next trend is um and when I when I get air drops um well I don't I don't really get air drops anymore because I'm not really that active in in the space but when I did when I used to get air drops my strategy was immediately convert half of it to bitcoin at least half to bitcoin and then let whatever else ride because like half the time they would just go to zero anyways um so at least you get some of that value out in inss um why don't we goe and move on because we do have two more questions and then I'd also like to get to audience questions at the end if you post your question now I probably won't see it so maybe wait like 10 minutes and then post it um this is an interesting question and I to be completely honest most people aren't going to care but gold is is one of these things where like it doesn't do anything for like 10 years you know and like if you think about this entire bitcoin's like like it's entire history essentially since 2009 gold has essentially gone nowhere in that in that entire phase but we just saw gold break to new all-time highs and it seems to be a somewhat explosive rally so I'm curious about what your thoughts are on gold um I I often think that people who like gold are are more alike to people who like Bitcoin than they would care to admit I think the main difference is the generation that we are right so if I were born one or two generations ago I probably would have been really into gold you know but because I'm born into more of the digital age I'm more into Bitcoin so I think we're more alike than different um so I'm curious like what your thoughts are on gold here it is now 2300 2400 um max where do you you know do you think that uh this is going to continue I me Silver is also not too far behind it in its own move um and I guess the other question is like why do you think gold is rallying so that's probably the bigger question is is why do you think it's rallying rather than like what do you think it's going to go to sure yeah the gold strength is um pronounced it's very impressive um and and I would say I mean why do people buy gold historically right it's sound money it was sound money before Bitcoin it was a store of value when you know our our parents generation was nervous about the state of the world they would you know convert their into gold and uh you know a lot of it is more of a um it's a mental thing it's a it's a mental insulation it's not like if your country was invaded you're going to put you know 500 pounds of gold on your back and somehow travel to another country right but it's a it's a peace of mind thing you know and you know again historically it is you know a sound currency uh there is a scarcity aspect to it there's a lot of commonality and overlap between gold and Bitcoin and I think everything you mentioned Ben is correct um I would say that my bias on gold um really stems more on my perspective and my my forecast on where I think dxy is headed and similarly where I think Bitcoin is headed I've already shared my opinion on where I think Bitcoin is going we have the Bitcoin having just around the corner um I expect Bitcoin to you Trend upwards aggressively over the next six to nine months subsequently I do believe that dxy is forming a sort of distribute you know a distribution here I do anticipate dxy topping very soon and again if you just overlay gold with dxy on a weekly chart you can see that there is a pretty prominent negative correlation between dxy and gold so I don't think we're I'm not of the opinion that we're going to see a decoupling where there's suddenly a a prolonged period of a positive correlation where gold rallies and dxy rallies I think that one of them is lying so either gold is lying or dxy is lying I think that gold is leading and going to see dxy of course sort of reclaim that negative correlation and begin to take a dive over the next quarter so um I do expect gold to continue upwards and I think it's probably off the back of the you know dxy weakening okay yeah fair enough um it has it has been really strong you know and I I can't help but look at it I'm like wow you have like a 10-year base I the bigger the base the more explosive the rally and for I mean for I know like all the crypto you know Deens are like you know it's up what like 10% or something and like people are like you know like 10% is like a minute candle on a meme coin right but for gold you know for an asset that's that high market cap like that is a big move in a really short period of time and so like that's why it it it means something Rob what are your thoughts here um are you are you are you watching this gold move I'm not watch I mean but I own it I own gold and silver and I I think and I don't I never UND and we talk about this many times I never understood why the old maximalists and this and the precious metal maximalists hate Bitcoin so much because like you said we're trying to all do the same thing we're trying to get out of the Matrix which is relying on paper Fiat and it just seems like I there's there's that one gold bug guy that is what we all talk about for some god- awful reason but in reality I think for the majority of people that are into precious metals I think they can see the value behind it and of of of Bitcoin itself and like I I like I never understood with this guy like why don't we have a debate between that guy and like Mike Maloney Mike Maloney is huge into gold he's put out a great series on precious medals and he's he likes Bitcoin as well so like when I take a look at this I I think you know why why not own why not old gold why not diversify like you know uh we've got I diversify not just in the crypto but the stocks precious metals and and real estate and I think everybody should do the you know kind of do the same thing but to talk about why gold went up so much let me I I don't know but how did gold do in 2022 was there any kind of rally during that time I mean it it it it still mostly stayed below the high I don't really think it did that well um it's only recently really started to show strength I mean I can I can pull it up and see but 2022 was kind of split it rallied in the first half of the year and then didn't really do too much and actually corrected a little bit looks like yeah I mean it looks like it topped in March of 2022 and then basically just went down yeah till November and then it rallied again into December kind of there there's a theory going around about why Gold's rallying so much it's because the Nations that are going to war they are trying they're fearful of us sanctions so how do how do you get away get around those sanctions well you stockpile Alternatives and one of those would be of course gold so people are talking about how Iran could be could have stockpiled after the Damascus situation and the and the bombing and the reason why I ask about 2022 is because for the Ukraine Invasion I think was February 2022 and the same type of thing was being said about Russia stockpiling gold at the same time so I can see I can kind of see that that valuation I don't know why they don't just use Bitcoin it's a heck of a lot easier to transfer and zip around value but that's where we're at yeah I always like I always think those posts by the gold bugs are so disingenuous because I mean like I I own both like I own Bitcoin and gold but like if you go to trading View and you look at the Bitcoin or you look at the Gold valuation against Bitcoin it's down so much since Bitcoin launched that it rounds it to negative 100% like like that's how far the valuation of gold has fallen against Bitcoin since Bitcoin has been around so again like it's not it's just look I mean the the Bitcoin valuation as far exceeded gold for a long time um I mean my guess is over the next 20 years Bitcoin will still outperform gold you know maybe in the short term gold could outperform uh Bitcoin but and I I mean I guess it has been since March right ever since gold broke out Gold's been doing better than even the S&P 500 even the NASDAQ um it's been having my view is that I I I think that gold is breaking out because it senses that um rate cuts are coming sooner than the market is potentially thinking and so that's kind of why I think I I think it's sort of sniffing something out just like it did in 2019 and and um but we'll see I mean you know we'll see if it if it plays out in the same way last question and I mean I you know this is more so geared towards Max um because I mean Rob is I mean you know you've been around here forever we' probably even asked this question you before yeah but I mean if you want to take it if you want to answer you can Max Max yeah so since you're new here um why did you start your YouTube channel I mean like what what was your motivation what are you helping to accomplish with it uh what brings you here well Ben you you actually played a big role in in bringing me here I was a very early follower of yours actually before you even had your website I bought your Google sheet way back in the day and I'm still locked into my original price thank you very much because I got in early pays to get in early um you know I I learned a lot from you in the very beginning and I went through last cycle and you know Ben and and Rob also this you know this is a compliment to both of you guys amongst a sea of grifters and thieves and people looking to prey on unsuspecting retail you know guys like yourselves you you conducted yourselves in a manner that you know I mean I can't even imagine how many millions of dollars you guys turn down from shill deals and you know crap like that and you know I I wanted to in the beginning play my you know play my part in that I felt as though I had opinions that you know um I could share something to offer I have you know I have an ability to lead I have you know an ability to organize a team um and I wanted to play my my part my equal share in the sort of collective hive mind of you know CT and and YouTube and help educate that's sort of the underpinning of of what I'm doing is I like to teach I like to collaborate and you know making money certainly feels nice right but there's a certain there's a certain sense of fulfillment that I personally get out of somebody messaging me saying hey because of what you said it made a difference in my life and something clicked for me and that feels really good and you know I I started because Bitcoin and it was it's a small Channel still um we're growing quickly certainly which of course if you go to Ben's beautiful website and you overlay social media growth with uh you know the price of Bitcoin you can see why I'm starting to grow quicker it's it's I'm doing the same thing I was doing all bare Market it's just suddenly more people care about crypto so um you know I am a i a result of good times and I pray that they continue on because of course it's you know a nice Tailwind for for my young business but yeah I mean really to answer the question Point Blank I love to teach I love to to collaborate and I love to debate you know like I have a differing opinion than you know you guys for some things and there's some overlap but that's what makes a market beautiful is that you can think one thing I can think another and we can come together and just talk about it politely and nobody knows what's going to happen right like we can't I have my hunch I have conviction just like you guys do but Bitcoin dominance could go to 90% And you know even over flip it and put that on on Twitter don't do that don't do that or or it could literally nuke down to 10% we could have like the crypto equivalent of the NASDAQ bubble between 1995 and 2000 where altcoins bubble like people you know can't imagine everybody's thrown money at altcoins speculating anything that's crypto and then 99 out of 100 of them don't exist in a couple years you know so who who knows what's going to happen but yeah I love to to collaborate and teach and debate and uh generally it's it's just a passion of mine how many subscribers are you guys at now like 13 14k or something yes on YouTube somewhere in between there yeah well there's 3,600 people watching so if everyone here goes and clicks the link in the description below and goes over to Max's Channel and subscribes then uh I I'm sure he would appreciate that and I think he deserves that he's been they've been putting out they it's not just Max by the way I mean it's a team of people um so go check that out you guys do like daily live streams right we Yeah we actually have a show coming up at uh 10:00 a.m. eastern time we do a Daily Show we've got a panel of Five Guys we're all just Traders wrap this one up then if you got it coming up in 10 minutes that's okay I got a big team they got it all right well before we before we end it here I I did want to take at least a couple of questions um and one of the questions I saw was um what is the best way to learn about crypto and to do your own research so I mean I don't know if they're talking about like from a fundamental perspective but I if someone were getting into crypto like like what do you guys use to do your research and I mean and maybe talk about like all the different tool or some at least some of the bigger tools that you guys have been using especially for all the different things that are happening in the cryptoverse there seems like there's a thousand different narratives that you could you know that you could follow and whoever wants to take that one is fine go ahead Max yeah um I would start on uh one of our three channels I think that's a really good place not to not to spew the obvious but um I would say I would say learn to do very basic ta right and understand Cycles like there's some very awesome free indicators out there like I mean you can even just look at like you know Ben has a a you he's kind of coined a very famous one he's combined a 20 week SMA and a 21 we EMA which has been sort of uh marketed as the bull market band for good reason right so you can determine when you know Bitcoin is trending upwards High time frame or trending down by just a simple you moving average band there's also things like the P Cycle top which I think people should keep an eye on which is again a free trading view indicator someone someone made it it's also on Ben's website there's also some some good onchain stuff like you know Bitcoin terminal price hoddle waves things like that I would as a beginner I would stay off the hourly time frame like literally just go daily time frame and above um and whenever you see Bitcoin down you know 50% from its its all-time high that's time to start paying attention to maybe consider entering the market but you know learn very very basic ta and and some of the more popular onchain indicators can really help you just DCA at the right time you know but stay off of the hourly time frames mainly the py cycle top just to give credit is uh was developed by Philip Swift um a while back and I the the idea was to predict the top with within 3 days and it did a really great job of doing that in the first uh the first 2021 Peak um and it actually happened I remember it happening and like no one really believed it you know um but I think it was retrofit right it was fit after yeah it was created in 2019 it was created in 2019 okay but it did it did get the first top in 2021 I feel like a lot of these like metrics that everyone created in 2019 uh it they called the first top but then most of them like didn't really call the second top because it was just sort of like a it was like a dead cat bounce that just somehow made it to New highs you know yeah um so yeah that was kind of an interesting one um Rob did you have anything to add just yeah just one thing Max makes all great points the thing I would say is that if you really knew you really really knew you have to understand that it's not how much you make it's how much you keep and the big thing is that you have to watch out for scams and things to watch out for and if you're gonna get into like hot storage wallets stuff like that there's a there's a video in the in the link of in the description of all my videos and it says you know things you the the big mistakes in crypto and it has like 20,000 views and of course it's the most important video I probably have ever put out because that's what people get screwed out and they get scammed out and if they watch that video they wouldn't happen to them another video I did when I'm gonna sell on my crypto has over 100,000 views so it just goes to show you like where the priorities are the priorities are make money but really the priority should be keep money someone's asking a um this the Market's not pricing it in right now but I did see like last night there's been a couple of times here where like there's at least some in investors like thinking about a rate hike um that is not like my base case at all like I think they're done I I think five and a half percent is the terminal rate for this cycle they might go higher next cycle uh but I I think five and a half percent at the top I'm not going to ask you if you think they're gonna hike again because I don't really think any of us think they're going to um if you do think that let me know but I guess my main question is what do you think would happen if they did hike again um because that be I mean that would talk about markets not pricing it in right I mean like I guess the the implication would be like if if the economy just accelerates into you know again and and there's not a cool down and we just keep on moving up uh what would a rate what would another rate hike do well what was real quick what was what is what has Jerome Powell said about fighting inflation do they say that they're on the right track or do they say like there's it's more more stubborn what he they've kind of like the progress has slowed a lot and I I think they've kind of specul that it it might influence their the number of rate Cuts this year because previously they had said three rate Cuts this year and I'm I'm wondering if they're starting to walk I mean now the market is pricing in only two rate cuts through April of 2025 so I my view is that you know I thought higher for longer but now that everyone else believes it I think I think it's going to go back the other way because once the market fully prices in no rate Cuts that's when people give up and you need to start having some rate cuts um but yeah I don't know I mean pal Po's basically said the same thing he said for the last three years if you know they're they're going to keep rates higher for longer until inflation's durably going back to 2% yeah I I think that 3% is is the new 2% truthfully I I I appreciate their narrative and their consistency and and how they haven't wavered on that and I think it's a great goal um but it seems like three is kind of a magnet actually a little above three um like you mentioned they are currently pricing in now it looks like you know our first 25 basis point cut on the uh September 18th meeting and then through April 2025 and and these percentages change all the time right uh you know we'll see what happens um you know potentially taking us down 50 basis points off of where we're currently at um let me answer your question what would happen if we got another 25 basis point hike because you know inflation decides it's going to rear its ugly head again and and start trending up above you know headline four 5% God forbid it's over I mean like we are going to absolutely nuke if we get another rate I'm gonna be as as clear as I can be if we get another rate hike markets are going to capitulate like that will be awful horrible for risk like sell all of your assets honestly like if that happens I'm not joking I think it'd be terrible I don't know if you guys agree with me but that would be horrible for markets but I don't think that's going to happen to be clear I think you could have the same thing happen if they just refuse to cut soon enough too because like it it you know like a tightening cycle is not just raising rates but it's also keeping rates too high for too long and the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and eight would have been in March um so we've already gone nine I think there's still you know there's still a window where talks about a soft Landing right it's so hard to thread that needle to a soft Landing because you have to stay high enough to make sure inflation doesn't come back in a second wave because if you don't and you get an inflation a secondary wave like the 70s you get a hard Landing but if you stay high for too long like let's say they stay at five and a half percent for another six months then you start to run the risk of of a deflationary crash right so that's why everyone sort of rolls their eyes about a soft Landing is because it's so difficult to thread that needle and I don't I do not envy their job I I do not envy their job because it's not and and they're also operating with long and variable lags like how can they know all the effects of prior monetary policy um so yeah it's it's a tough place for them to be and and we are oh sorry Rob go ahead no no go ahead Max I was going to say you know we are seeing some smaller economies in my opinion forecasting when our rate cuts are coming like we have seen the Czech Republic actually start to cut we've seen Poland cut um so it you know historically it's not perfect right but you are starting to see some of these smaller countries actually they they LED through the hik so they began to hike first they paused first and they've actually started to cut so I I do anticipate that you know in similar fashion to what has happened historically we will see the US begin to I guess cut rates hopefully uh later this year um but I do agree with you Ben like if they held rates where they're currently at through you know all of 2024 that would also put some pressure um on our economy and our markets but with that said like I don't know what you you guys think but I mean really the the final you know real dagger or Domino to fall is going to be of course unemployment creeping up above four four and a half percent do you guys think that if they just held rates where they're currently at all through 2024 um but we didn't see the labor market really deteriorate could financial markets hold up in that instance I mean if if the labor market doesn't deteriorate sure I just think that um I mean it seems like the unemployment rate is trending up um and the the problem with with that is that it doesn't tend to move in a linear fashion right it it goes slow and then it starts to accelerate at some point and we haven't reached the acceleration phase right so there's still a chance that we can avoid it but the longer they wait the the the riskier that's going to be I think I think there's a higher probability of a rate cut this summer than the market is giving credit for I don't think it has to happen this summer but I think the right thing to do is to cut at least 25 basis points uh this summer 50 basis points something like that just uh provide something you know are you thinking in the June meeting or July meeting I mean look last cycle I know that that the altcoin market was a lens into the consumer and I know that that when alts broke down against Bitcoin and when eth broke down against Bitcoin the FED basically cut one month later um and we we have seen eth fall against Bitcoin it had a weekly close below the June low we saw madic Bitcoin uh crash below it's June 2022 low we've seen adaa Bitcoin and Dot bit coin we've seen Litecoin Bitcoin and a Bitcoin I mean so many of these altcoins are are falling off their Bitcoin support levels and you can see it with the Bitcoin dominance so I think that the pricing out of all these rate Cuts is going to cause them to get priced in because the FED does not base their decisions on what our altcoins are doing right un they don't care what I what I what I find unfortunate is that a lot of the small like companies like Mom and Pop shops a lot of them are going out of business business right now because you know rates are going up and and and times are getting harder like inflation is so high so people just can't afford as much and but the FED has to do it because all of us Deens in the in the space can't help ourselves from bidding up jpegs you know and and and leading inflation uh to to where it was so I think that it's it's kind of a tough spot to be and the FED has to stay long enough to kind of break the animal spirits but if they do it too long then you then then you run the other issue of of a deflationary um unwind and that's not really fun either I know like people are like oh I'd love to go to the store and not spend as much money but if you if prices go down that's probably not good for risk assets terrible just yeah so everybody everybody who's watching the videos remember this when when you think like okay the Bitcoin Market or the crypto Market has to do this thing it has to do this thing because it's it's been the cycle that's always done this doesn't actually work like what we just talked about just how fragile the markets actually are and just to think how things have to really go in line before you realize that oh maybe I should have taken some profits when there was uh everything was overheated just it's just something to think about because I hate people who roundtrip and uh they really should again take some profits when everything gets too hot and and one thing just to mention about rate cuts and I mean you guys probably know this rate Cuts inherently are not bearish right it's it's the underpinning as to why they are cutting rates and you know if you actually on a granular level you go and you overlay the effective federal funds rate with you know the NASDAQ or S&P 500 markets actually tend to rally for like 30 to 60 days give or take following the First Rate cut until they wake up and they realize oh crap there's economic deterioration under the surface which is why they're cutting rates and then we see these major Corrections so I think whether the first 25 basis point comes in June or the end of July meeting or I guess hopefully September um that's probably your 30 to 60-day warning truthfully whenever it comes and I don't know when it will and what about no go ahead I was going to say you're right I mean like the rate Cuts inherently are are are bullish for risk assets if they're cutting for the right reasons in 2019 while Bitcoin topped out when rate Cuts arrived the S&P 500 kept going up and you know because the mark like the the economy was not in a recession right it wasn't going into a recession they were sort of like preliminary rate Cuts You could argue that Bitcoin is more tied to financial markets today traditional markets today than it was back then because of the spot ETF so maybe it would track the S&P 500 a bit closer than it did last cycle once rate Cuts arrive but the issue is why the FED is cutting are they cutting because they're trying to get ahead of something bad that's coming or are they cutting as a reactionary thing because they just saw a really bad labor market prance and that is is when they're not bullish like that's when rate cuts are be so it all depends on Max is right it all depends on why they're cutting and and I think that it's also risky to I I I do believe that there's just as much risk to the UPS side truthfully where you know assuming that they're going to cut because there is severe economic deterioration can also be you know a very harmful strategy long term because like you mentioned the first batch of rate cuts that we saw in 2019 um you know the S&P 500 rallied out of those cuts like 15% and then of course we had our Co nuke in March which took us below you know where that that first uh cut occurred right but you know again it's like you have to be very careful you kind of threading your own needle per se because just because they're cutting doesn't mean sell everything right because they could cut you know the labor market could be more resilient than anybody's expecting the S&P 500 could go up 50% over the next year and then something bad happens and you get a correction but that correction doesn't take you down to as low as the point in which the first cut happens so you just have to be a little bit careful truthfully you know you have to really understand why they're cutting and and it's a tough thing to do it's very tough I me with the S&P you know there there's been all sorts of like crises throughout all the decades but if you just pull up a chart over a 100 years I mean you know the the the overall trend is clear you know um the markets generally go up because the money supply yeah yeah you know why did prices of houses go up 40% because the supply of money went up 40 per. you know it's not it's not I it's not really that complicated so yeah no I mean I think like as always right like time in the market often beats time the market um because it's impossible to to actually time the market for under most circumstances and I think sometimes people get lucky with it and then assume that they're like a genius and can do it again and again and again um but the reality is that the market will humble us all at some point why don't we go ahead and wrap it up there um we we'll have NFA live back I guess next week next week I think it'll be on Rob's Channel um so we'll see you guys over there next week and again if you're not subscribed uh to to Max or Rob links for their channels are in the description below and uh we will see you guys next time

we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the having if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom the sale will be ending just after the having so make sure you check it out and lock in the lower rate let's go ahead and jump in the Bitcoin having is probably one of the most significant events in our industry I often find people debating every cycle you know whether the having is priced in or not whether it has an effect on pric or not my view is that you know we've had three having before we had one in 2012 one in 2016 and of course one in 2020 and I I certainly do think that the having does play a role in the cycles of the crypto verse um I also think that monetary policy plays a role but I don't really fall in either Camp completely I don't think that it's only based on supply side stuff and I don't think it is only based on you know monetary policy I think it's a combination of of different things markets are complex um they're they're based on a lot of different things and so because the having is one of the most important events I wanted to do a video where we talk about it and talk about where where I have previously said that theit the price of Bitcoin may be now price predictions are honestly something that I'm not super into um because usually you know usually price predictions don't really turn out that great if if you put in a price prediction and it goes above it then you know the comments aren't so nice and if you put a price prediction and we don't quite get there you know people are also upset but I wanted to to revisit something that I said four years ago and kind of see like where are we with respect to that so four years ago I put out this video Bitcoin Fair valuation at the next tabing in 2024 I put out this video in 2020 in May of 2020 the price of Bitcoin was around $8,000 and what I said back then was that if we follow the fair value logarithmic regression trend line then by the fourth having which is the having that's about to occur the price to bitcoin would be between 40 to $50,000 okay that's what I said back then clearly we are above that price right clearly if we go back and look at the video that I put out a year ago or no this was at the end of 2022 um or mid 2022 just before the the the um the final collapse occurred I also sort of Drew it out going to around a 40 to 50K so with Bitcoin right now at 63k it's ahead right I mean there's no denying it it's ahead of where I said it was going to be back then now of course back then putting out a price prediction four years later um and and hoping that it would be accurate at all was probably something I was fairly naive about uh but here we are 4 years later and the price of Bitcoin is actually above the target range that I put and it's also above this area that I put as well going into the having and so with that in mind I I want to discuss a couple of things that that may come up after the having um that could very well uh take some people by surprise now there's a lot of different thoughts to this current cycle with it being you know so hot at this point in the cycle we've never seen the market put in new highs before the having right this is the first time ever that Bitcoin has put in new highs before the having and so that was you know probably one of the reasons why back then I I didn't think it would be quite so high but we are at new highs before the having and so I just want to talk about what you know what to potentially expect after the happing now there's two different trends of thought here one of which is a left translated Peak okay now to be completely honest I'm not really in the left translated Peak camp but it does have like maybe 40% of my attention and the reason for that is if you were to take the ROI of Bitcoin from Peak to Peak and you take it from the April Peak Peak instead of the November 2021 Peak and you compare it to last cycle it sort of looks like it potentially could form into a peak sooner rather than later in which case you would get a left translated top meaning the the the actual top occurs way before anyone thinks it will historically Bitcoin has topped out in the fourth quarter of the post having year so if you look at Major Peaks that Bitcoin has had in the past if I were to get an arrow here you can see that this top was in Q4 of the post having year this one was in Q4 of the post having year and this one was in Q4 of the posst having Year we're currently in Q2 of the having year so you know that is is still about six quarters away when Bitcoin typically tops but again so far this cycle is anything but typical with Bitcoin putting in new before the having so if it is to translate into a left translated Peak a left translated cycle then it would be more likely that the top would occur in 2024 as opposed to 2025 if we are going to follow that then I have to imagine that we would follow potentially what happened last cycle now it's not really my base cas but again it would be foolish not to at least acknowledge the similarities but on the other hand where I would say 60% of my attention is right now is what if this cycle is just like prior cycles and we are all over here jumping through hoops trying to explain why this time is different when potentially it just Peaks when it normally does and one way that we could go about getting to that point would be that if we had a cool off in the summer okay now there's no guarantee and if we follow this path then you might see the exact opposite of a summer lull but if there is a summer lull then one thing to keep in mind when you look at the last two cycles as measured Peak to Peak you can see that at this point in the cycle Bitcoin was only up or it was it was actually still about 60% down from its all-time high now I want you to think about that for a minute in both prior Cycles at this point as measured Peak to Peak Bitcoin was 60% below the all-time high 60% below it now right now Bitcoin is not 60% below the prior high in fact 60% below the prior High would put Bitcoin all the way down at around $26,000 that's how accelerated we are this cycle look at the last cycle 60% down from that Peak you can see that by May of 2020 that was when the having occurred Bitcoin was down 60% from the high and then if you go back to the cycle before that this the that the having occurred in July if I remember correctly and if you go to July of 2016 you will see that Bitcoin was approximately down 60% from the high this having it's not right it's not 60% down from the high in fact it is at the high it's at the high which has never happened before so this has caused a lot of people to view this cycle as different from the prior ones and I have to tell you they make a fair point they make make a fair point and if you measure it from the April top you can kind of see that Bitcoin is doing just about what it always does at this point in the cycle if you take the April top as the more important top and of course there is evidence to suggest that the April top is the more important top for instance some of that evidence to suggest the April top is the more important top is to look at views to a lot of different cryptocurrency YouTube channels and to note that there were more views in the first half of 2021 than there were in the second half where Bitcoin basically just put in a lower high in terms of social activity but somehow a higher high in terms of price if you look at Bitcoin with respect to its 50e moving average one of the things that it does after every major cycle top is that it goes back down to the 50 we and then gets a bounce a dead cap bounce before ultimately capitulating we saw that happen over here as well go back to the 50 we get a dead bounce and then go all the way down this past cycle we did not see that exactly what happened was we went back to the 50 we and instead of it just being a dead cap bounce to a lower high which is what potentially that would have been we ended up getting a higher high which took a lot of people off guard now I was optimistic of a higher high but honestly I think because of for for wrong reasons you know and sometimes you get things right for the wrongs reasons and and it's important to take that into consideration so we can see that that happened right we can see that we went to the 50 we we got a bounce but that time it actually led to a higher high the even the intermediate bull market in 2019 had us bouncing off the 50 week at some point and so the 50 we today is at around 40K it's at 39.2k 39.3k which is interesting because again that is way below the current prices way below current prices and I have to imagine that if we do not evolve into a left translated top if we do not right so there's two op you know there's two options right we evolve into a left translated top where the peak occurs in 2024 or we evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 if we're going to evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 you really need to see Bitcoin cool off for a while and again as measured Peak to Peak you can see just how far quote unquote ahead of schedule this cycle is it's actually not that unfamiliar when you think about it the reason it seems like this time is different is because Bitcoin is at new all-time Highs but if you look at the last cycle there was a period where it too was well above its prior cycle but what eventually happened is it bled back down and basically got in line with the prior cycle and then still ended up showing diminishing returns okay and then it actually got ahead of that cycle again this is why a lot of people thought we were going to go to 300 K last cycle but it still was diminishing returns so I want to continue to put forth this idea that if we do not evolve into a left translated Peak sometime around the having and instead the market cools off going into the summer then you might just see something like this where it causes the cycle to just get back in line with prior Cycles now that of course could make a lot of people think that the cycle that the peak is over and and the Bull Run is is is completely done and and maybe they're right right but there is at least some evidence to suggest that that could be what is ultimately in store for us as we get lat into the cycle if you're not familiar with how the last cycle worked and why we what what happened when we bled back down here there's a number of things that really put Bitcoin back into a intermediate bare Market sort of you had a a quantitative tightening bull market and then a bare Market as rate Cuts arrived and then a QE bull market that topped in 2025 now take a a look at Bitcoin this cycle and see how it's doing something very very similar in the sense that it's had this major run during High interest rates you can see it's had this run during High interest rates and in fact if you were to look very closely at when the FED paused here and compare it to this you can see something very similar happened right it it fell just after the FED paused here it fell just after the FED paused and then it went up quite a lot but ultimately what happened is that it it found a local top as just before rate Cuts arrived and then it bled for a while before getting another bull run into the post having year now by the way the having is only four four days away so if we do come up and put in a new local high before the having or maybe around the having that still doesn't necessarily invalidate the idea of the market cooling off sometime after the having if the left translated Peak is not going to occur okay so again there's two thoughts you have a left translated Peak where us Deens just can't help ourselves and everyone just front run runs everything until until the consumer caves or the other idea which would support the idea of this time not being different would just for the cycle to get back in line now if the cycle gets back in line then maybe this view from four years ago of around a you know 40 to 50K Bitcoin by the fourth having isn't that far off I know right now if we were to go back to 40 to 50 okay it would probably feel like the world's falling apart for a lot of people but one thing to consider is that when when e I'm you know I don't know how I made it this far in the video without talking about it one thing to consider last cycle is that the 30% drop Bitcoin had pretty shallow drops during this QT bull market right pretty shallow drops and then eventually it finally got a 30% drop that 30% drop corresponded precisely to the point when eth Bitcoin broke down and eth Bitcoin just broke down below the summer 2022 low so if you were to get a 30% drop sometime after the having that would actually put you kind of right around that range that we said way back over here and in addition to that it would also get you Loosely backed in line with where the prior Cycles were so going into this Bitcoin having is certainly different in the sense that we've never seen a new all-time high before the habing if you were to go look at the risk metric of Bitcoin you will see that the risk on bitcoin has never been this High going into the having in fact the last time we went into the the the 20 when we went into the 2020 having the risk of Bitcoin was at 04 when you look at the 2016 having in July of 2016 the risk on bitcoin was 0.4 today the Bitcoin risk is6 so it's actually quite a bit higher than it was during the last two 3 to4 this time we find ourselves at 639 and only a few weeks ago the risk was in the 7 to8 risk band to give you an idea of what the 04 risk band would look like which is where we were going into the last two that's where the 04 to 0.5 wristband is that's where the price of Bitcoin was at the last two Habs and you can see actually that Bitcoin when those rate Cuts arrived right here had that correction back to the 100 we moving average now what's fascinating about that is that it would correspond to the prior breakout zone so I I I feel like there's two different ways that we can look at the market here here that make the most amount of sense number one is that this is not different from the prior cycles and we're kind of on track with where we should be and that could be viewed by maybe looking at the ROI after the after the low if you look at the ROI after the low and you compare this cycle with two cycles ago this is exactly where we were but you can see that it at this point it did cool off for a while and then did get a drop kind of um you know this was day 520 or so about you know a month and a half from now or so so you can view it like that or you can view it from the peak and still say we're where we should be based on uh based on measuring it from the April top right if you take this out Peak to Peak if you measure it from the April top we're pretty much where we should be but again I can't help but think are we are we are we doing the same thing again where everyone tries to come up with a reason for why this time is different but in reality it's not so my thought process on the matter is this as we go into the Bitcoin having if Bitcoin accelerates into the having and post having and into June right if it is something like that where you know over here in 2019 in fact before rate Cuts arrived it actually did rally in until June last year we had a a local top in April but then we swept the high in June if we get something like that where Bitcoin continues to go up throughout the summer then I would be more in tune with the idea of a left translated top where you get a top in 2024 as opposed to say 2025 however on the other hand if you get a low Top by Bitcoin here as rate Cuts arrive and then instead of you know and that could still include sweeping the prior high right but if you get a look kind of like we did over here with the spot ETF we we put in a new high on the day of the spot ETF for the cycle if on the other hand we see the market cool off into the summer and go to say the 04 to 0.5 wristband or even the 0. 3 to point4 wristband and we get the market more back in line with the prior two cycles then I I think that perhaps the base case should still be that the cycle is playing out just as it always has and you still could get a top in in late 2025 and in fact it was this very intermediate bare Market that kind of scared a lot of people off in fact what happens if something like that happens again where rate Cuts arrive and you go back down scares a lot of people off and then because everyone gets scared off the FED starts printing money again and then you get a QE bow Market I've said this before and I'll say it again there's two types of bull markets in crypto there's quantitative tightening bull markets that occur during periods when the FED is lowering reducing the assets on their balance sheet that's what we got in 2019 and that's what we've got over here and during those periods during those periods eth Bitcoin goes down eth Bitcoin goes down during QT quantitative tightening bull markets how many people for the last couple of years have said that eth outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market that's not true not without any disclaimer because as you can see bitcoin's been going up since late November of 2022 and eth Bitcoin has been going down the entire time so that is why I still think there is some evidence to suggest the cycle may play out like it always does rather than a left translated top I'm not completely unsympathetic to the idea of a left translated Peak there's a lot of really smart people out there that frankly provide a compelling case for it and I could honestly provide a compelling case for it I just showed you guys some of the different charts but if Bitcoin does not run into the highest wristbands the 0. N to one wristband this summer and instead it just cools off like it did back over here after the having it might scare a lot of people off but perhaps it's just doing what it did last cycle and it the only reason that the top the local the midcycle top came later was because rate Cuts came later this cycle than they did last cycle so you have quantitative tightening bull markets where Bitcoin goes up as e Bitcoin bleeds all Bitcoin pairs bleed and then you have QE bull markets that go where Bitcoin goes up as eth Bitcoin goes up so eth outperforms Bitcoin in a QE Market but not a QT Market there's two different different types of bull markets so that is a very important distinction and I think we've only received more and more evidenced over the last year that Bitcoin really is dependent somewhat on monetary policy because last September when eth Bitcoin came back down to to this area right here there were there were a lot of people that thought that it had bottomed because that's when it had bottomed in the last cycle Q3 of the pre having year this development here which is what I said was likely going to happen this development of the the devaluation of eth against Bitcoin shows that the market is very much dependent on monetary policy whether we want to believe it or not so if that is the case right if that continues to be the case then you very well could see a a repeat of what happened over here sort of an intermediate Lull in the market followed by because of rate Cuts right that occur during rate Cuts followed by the last rate cut which leads to a QE bull market where you maybe top out when you normally do in the latter part of the post tapping year so two different theories if you're new here that's what is you know has really been discussed over the last uh year or so is this cycle different is it not I honestly think if you if you have a bias on it you're going to find the evidence that you're looking for um I I think we we'll know soon enough we we'll know soon enough if Bitcoin cools off into the summer which it very well could we we've seen gold breakout just like it did in mid 2019 we've seen eth Bitcoin break down just like it did in mid 20 M mid 2019 all Bitcoin pairs still haven't broken down yet but if it cools off into the summer then it just seems like it's the same thing as last cycle it's just that the the midcycle top was nine months later about about n nine months later if on the other hand after the having Bitcoin just accelerates to the upside once again then I will have to uh I will probably say that there's more Merit to the idea of of a left translated top but that's what I'm looking at right now and so to just revisit my prediction back in 2020 what would be the fair value of Bitcoin at the fourth having of 40 to 50k I find myself today seeing a $64,000 Bitcoin 4 days before the having and I I can't think I can't help but think to myself wow back then when I made that prediction I thought it was a lofty prediction that frankly was maybe not you know not that likely to come true because you know when Bitcoin is at 8K and and it really hadn't done anything for a couple of years I wasn't really that optimistic um of of you know exactly how accurate this prediction would be come to find out I was too conservative potentially right I was too conservative so it just goes to show how difficult these markets are to predict um four years ago price of Bitcoin was at 8K I said fourth having 40 to 50 instead we find ourselves at 64 and what's fascinating to me is that if we were at 40 to 50K I think it would you know a lot of people would think the the world's falling apart when in reality that would have been what the fair value sort of suggested it would be and that chart that chart that you see in that video is just this chart right here um these regression bands here so at the last taing we were at the fair value that's the other thing that why I said 40 to 50K back then because at every prior having Bitcoin was at the fair value so in no the fit to non-bubble data so in November 2012 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to non-bubble data in July of 2016 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to quote unquote non-bubble data in May of 2020 Bitcoin was at its fair value fit to again quote unquote non bubble data theoretically I should have updated this chart because it does I think need to get updated every cycle I haven't really done it yet if I did update it it would just shift it down very very slightly but right now according to this chart the fair value is around um 52k 52k but if you if you were to refit it based on this data over here it would actually probably put the fair value somewhere between 40 to 50K which is why I said back over here like we'll have to refit it um and and it'll be around 40 to 50K so we're above that level right now if on the other side of the having or something we see that level just know that that is is is what the um you know the regression band would have ultimately suggested for this part of the cycle so those are my thoughts going into the Bitcoin having we will see what happens uh as the having comes around it's only four days away and and we will do an update in maybe a month or so we'll see what happened you know after the having if we just contined to rally on into a left translated top or if it cools off like 2019 and and we just kind of come back down and and cool off until until the last rate cut arrives if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs

but I would go ahead and get it now if you want the subscription at the lower rate before we jump in I I would like to say thank you to everyone who is a subscriber here I like to kind of take a step back when I hit these major milestones and just say you know I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing it means the world to be at 800,000 subscribers you know when I started the channel I had no idea that it it would grow to be this big uh but here we are and I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing to the channel and I know I don't get everything right and I I do get things wrong um but I do appre appreciate you guys sticking with me uh either way so I just wanted to to acknowledge that and to say thank you to everyone for being a subscriber also the the having is is almost here and in fact by the time you watch this video the having's probably already happened um I'll try to get the video out here uh in a in a in you know 30 minutes or so um if we take a look when it's going to occur at least from when I'm recording this video it's going to be about 5 hours um but by the time you're watching this video it's probably going to be a lot less and it could already be behind us if you go look at the um at the the how many blocks it looks like we only have about 30 blocks to go so it is coming up really really soon and I I just think it's such a big event I'm going to try to live stream it that's my goal is to try to live stream the event uh it is in about again 5 hours it's going to be a little tricky cuz that's going to sort of correspond with some uh bedtime routines for my kids uh but I will try to to to live stream it if I can uh so do look out for that here in the next four or I guess by the time you're watching this video it'll be a different time but ideally I'm going to try to get get on here live by 8:30 Eastern um is my goal but again no promises so Bitcoin is is currently at at 64k we're going to keep this pretty short um because I mean you guys know my thoughts on the market but I do just want to say you know there there's a couple of different scenarios that could play out and I'm sure you've seen me talk about him a thousand times you've probably seen everyone else talk about him a thousand times the the sort of the two main short-term things so sort of the most likely outcomes in the short term are either you go straight to the 20we SMA following the habing or you get a bounce first to go just north of the 8 week moving average and then you resolve to a a lower low in May um off of off of whatever low this is you know so those are the sort of the two most likely shortterm outcomes to me again I I don't know which one will play out I I could certainly find evidence for both I will say you know with the S&P 500 at its own bull market support ban I I really do Wonder like well if if the S&P can go to it 20we SMA why can't Bitcoin you know I mean it's been a long time and with the S&P it had been really since November since it had been at its 20we SMA and now it's there once again and I wonder like you know with Bitcoin what's to keep it from going to its own 20we SMA it hasn't seen it since really mid October so if the S&P 500 can go there why can't Bitcoin in fact it's not even just the S&P if you were to look at at eth you can see it's been wicking down to its 20we moving average already you can see the riskier assets are already hitting it um if you look at at total three you can see that it's already been wicking down to its bull market support band so as you go you know further up the risk curve it's easier for those assets to hit that 20we SMA because when Bitcoin sneezes the the the altcoin market gets annihilated and you can see that I mean Bitcoin is still well above its 20we moving average in fact I mean in fact for it to go to its 20we SMA it would require about another 15 % drop from the current prices the problem with that for things like eth and and alts is that if Bitcoin were to do that then they likely go below their bull market support bands and this is exactly what we saw in 2019 right we saw eth go below its bull market support band after that local top just after eth Bitcoin broke down before Bitcoin did so that when Bitcoin bounced off of its 20we ese in the short term even didn't hold it as support eventually it bounced off of it ethusd basically just held resistance at the bull market support band so I I do think there there's some some reason to think it could play out like that you know as much as there there very well could be sort of a relief into late April early May um just keep an eye on on the 20we SME because you know the hard part with it is that you know you can look at at at prior local tops right you can look at things like 2021 and and 2019 and see that they had these rallies back up to the 8-week moving average on their first weekly close below the 8we moving average right so the first weekly close below the 8we right here in 2019 we rallied right back above the 8we and then formed a lower high in 2021 right same type of thing right go below the 8 we and then rally on back up the thing is is like we could see a weekly close below the 8we but we haven't necessarily even seen it yet also note that in 2019 after you had that rally back above the 8we it was after a 34% drop you know at this time Bitcoin has really only dropped about the same amount that it has been about 20% right I mean you know as much as it might feel like it's it's been more brutal this time that's only because the altcoin market is getting hammered but that's what alts do best in you know when Bitcoin sneezes alts get annihilated so you can see that so far this is a pretty standard drop for Bitcoin right 20% nothing too different from what we've seen um but do note that while it is 20% the the rally back to the 8we SMA in 2019 occurred after it had gone down you know closer to 30% which would actually get you near that 20we moving average so it's really hard to say and and while it is convenient of course to compare to 2019 and early 21 because you know I'm sure everyone would like that rally back up to the8 week SMA there's also other examples uh like like 20 late 2021 where you get something like this where you you know you're putting in these weekly closes where the Wicks are lower right you can see that right the Wicks are lower there as well just like they were over here um but you ended up just getting a capitulation down right so there's no guarantee right there's no guarantee with the market and I think like I I think honestly we're not going to you know next week will be sort of the decision point on on if you're going to bounce off of it or not um this week I imagine it's not going to you know we're not going to fully know I mean this you know it's already Friday anyways but yeah I I think it's just I mean it's certainly interesting because you're not only looking at at Bitcoin sort of slowly fading back in uh but you can see that a lot of other markets are as well right like the S&P is down to its bull market support band eth is down to its bull market support band or at least it has been wicking there it's not there at the current moment but it has been for the last couple of days off and on and then you have some altcoins that are below their 20we SMA already right I mean um I'm sure a lot of them are right I don't know if link is yeah link is Ada is Litecoin is not surprisingly madic is um dot is I mean a lot of them are already below their Market sport band so you can see that like the stronger assets are still above it Bitcoin is still above it right now but you know I I look at these other markets you know even the Russell the Russell is below it right so this is a great example of how the S&P is at the 20 we but the Russell is below it so you could see something happen very very similar in crypto where Bitcoin goes to its 20 we and when it does if and when it does then maybe alts go below it right that could could very well play out sometime after the having whether you get a rally to the 8we SMA or not right and again I don't know um if we're going to go to the 8 week ese next week or if it's going to be like you know a month later I could easily come up with a reason for either scenario easily easily it it's going to depend on what your bias is um so I I really I really can confidently say I don't know which one's going to play out but I will say that regardless of whether you get a relief to the 8we or not my expectation is that Bitcoin will go to the 20we moving average within the next few weeks right you know within probably either this month or next month is my guess I mean it's been a long time right I mean it seems like we're due for it in 2019 you know it it took about 25 weeks you know something like that in you know 2020 or so all the way through 2021 we fell back into it in in May in fact and that was about 32 weeks we're currently at what 26 weeks right so my guess is you know sometime in the next 6 weeks we're going to find ourselves at the bull market support band and then we'll see what's up again my guess is that if if Bitcoin sort of chops around in this range for a few months that's what should send the Bitcoin dominance to 60% right so if it goes down to the 20e Ese and then it bounces back up for a little bit to the 8we ese or vice versa goes to the a week first and then goes to the 20 week it's that chopping process that should break the altcoin market down and I mean you can see it already happening you know with eth Bitcoin which is something we've been following you know for a long time you know it's now at 0482 now it is you know talking about this sort of stuff on the the sort of the cusp of a major Bitcoin event you know there could be counter Trend rallies for this stuff but again you know my guess is that eth Bitcoin is is just sort of doing something like this after breaking down where it it sort of TR to hold on for a week but inevitably it keeps on bleeding into into the summer months where maybe it finally can potentially bottom so that is my view here going into into the having remember if there is a larger drop in the crypto verse uh following the having whether it's immediately after or whether it's delayed by a few weeks one thing to remember right one thing that I I I think you should remember is that when you measure things from the peak and you go Peak to Peak Bitcoin is ahead of schedule by a lot right it really is it can afford to give back a lot of that and still be in line with prior Cycles we've said that forever this is why I've said Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio because it's going to outperform the altcoin marketing till QE Returns the problem for alts you know I'll tell you the problem for alts is that if Bitcoin just drops back down here to get back in line with the prior Cycles just like last cycle it dropped back in line to get to get back in line with its prior cycle if Bitcoin drops here to get back in line with the last two cycles guess what alts can go back down to their lows or they can put in new lows because they're not that far off of their lows to begin with whereas Bitcoin is right you know Bitcoin is already well off its low whereas the alts a lot of them are not now some of them are but a lot of most of them are not really that far off of their low so I mean you know if you see a situation where Bitcoin just simply goes back to where it you know where it was in the last two cycles at this point that's how the altcoin market can put in you know a lot of alts can put in new lows even in the having year and we saw that happen last cycle as well and and I know there's always going to be some type of reason for it or justification or rationalization but that is just what I've seen you know cycle after cycle after cycle is that alts can get that bounce in the prehab year but inevitably as you get later on in the business cycle and we get you know as the Market is really starting to digest all those rate hikes and and the FED refusing to Pivot sufficiently that's where alts you know the order books are thin and that's where they just continue to slowly bleed uh not only on their USD pairs but also their Bitcoin Pairs and then my guess is that once you start getting multiple weekly closes by Bitcoin below its 20we moving average I think there's a good chance that at that point Bitcoin dominance has topped but between now and then I think that you're going to see it you're going to see Bitcoin USD sort of chop around in this range for a couple of months um and during that time I I think the Bitcoin dominance will go uh to 60% as eth Bitcoin goes to 003 to 04 and and all Bitcoin pairs go all the way back down from 0 42 to where they currently are down to about .25 best case scenario and that's if you want to say that they're oscillators right so back down to 0.25 or so so that is is really my view right now on the market um there are also sort of other views that you could look at that sort of revolve around if it wants to follow some of the prior you know the prior Trends with some major geopolitical events we did see Bitcoin over here you know put in some scary Wicks back in early 2022 um and then they still swept the local high after that so there is always a chance that something like that happens as well um so be ready for anything uh but I I do think that the market would greatly benefit from a a summer lull where it just kind of gets boring for a little while and all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out that's what I think would be the best case for the cryptoverse is a a summer where all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out because no one cares anymore you know all the hype is behind us and then then you start to see them find their true lows on their Bitcoin pairs you know for everyone who is who's laughed at the idea of the devaluation of all Bitcoin pairs they just put in a new low last week right they just put in a new new low last week so don't laugh at it I mean this is just what happened last cycle you know it's just exactly what happened and and if they do come back down here like over here then I I think there's no debating anymore that it it really is following sort of what 2019 was it's just that the reason why it was delayed until the having year was because rate Cuts occur potentially now in the having year as opposed to the preh having year like last cycle so to me it all looks like it's playing out in a very similar manner where all Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows just before rate Cuts arrive the onset of rate Cuts potentially as early as this summer should allow a Bitcoin pairs to bottom out and then a USD pairs can find whatever low they're going to find um based on how how low Bitcoin goes and then perhaps by the last rate cut uh then you start to see it go the other way the biggest Counterpoint to all these views is if it's a um you know if we just get some manic blowoff top or something this summer uh following some type of left translated cycle I mean you could have a left translated cycle where the top is is March right I mean that's what happened in the dot crash right I mean that the top was in March of the election year that's not really my base case though um but I I would say I would say that if you are to get a left translated cycle where Bitcoin just goes parabolic into all the um into all the bad news and everything then you know then that would sort of invalidate the views that I'm expressing um my base case though is that we are just simply repeating what we saw uh back over here and all Bitcoin pairs should come down as we get into this summer and and by you know maybe by June July something like that I I could see all Bitcoin pairs finally bottoming out not withstanding Maybe some future Bitcoin parabolic rally which we saw over here but that is is you know really my view on the market right now and we will see if it if it continues to pan out or not in the meantime bitcoin's at 64k um and we'll see if it if it goes to the 20we estimate in the next couple of weeks or if instead it first rallies back up to just above or just around its 8we moving average um uh first but either way I do think we are due for a test of the bullmark sport band here in the next you know month month and a half if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the crypts premium at intothe crypto.com we have tons of charts thousands of different charts for a lot of different cryptocurrencies if there's a lot of cryptocurrencies that you have that you

website a website with thousands of charts for altcoins right so I I'm not I just I I'm I I put my maxi hat on when Bitcoin dominance is in a macro uptrend and I I don't really think you should blame me for that um but do check it out links in the description below that sale will end uh this weekend after the having so make sure you lock in the low rate between now and then and I will see you guys uh hopefully tonight for the uh for the live stream of the having which is only a few hours from now but I can't make any promises that I'll be there it's going to depend on on how some uh some of the

what we've seen um but do note that while it is 20% the the rally back to the 8we SMA in 2019 occurred after it had gone down you know closer to 30% which would actually get you near that 20we moving average so it's really hard to say and and while it is convenient of course to compare to 2019 and early 21 because you know I'm sure everyone would like that rally back up to the8 week SMA there's also other examples uh like like 20 late 2021 where you get something like this where you you know you're putting in these weekly closes where the Wicks are lower right you can see that right the Wicks are lower there as well just like they were over here um but you ended up just getting a capitulation down right so there's no guarantee right there's no guarantee with the market and I think like I I think honestly we're not going to you know next week will be sort of the decision point on on if you're going to bounce off of it or not um this week I imagine it's not going to you know we're not going to fully know I mean this you know it's already Friday anyways but yeah I I think it's just I mean it's certainly interesting because you're not only looking at at Bitcoin sort of slowly fading back in uh but you can see that a lot of other markets are as well right like the S&P is down to its bull market support band eth is down to its bull market support band or at least it has been wicking there it's not there at the current moment but it has been for the last couple of days off and on and then you have some altcoins that are below their 20we SMA already right I mean um I'm sure a lot of them are right I don't know if link is yeah link is Ada is Litecoin is not surprisingly madic is um dot is I mean a lot of them are already below their Market sport band so you can see that like the stronger assets are still above it Bitcoin is still above it right now but you know I I look at these other markets you know even the Russell the Russell is below it right so this is a great example of how the S&P is at the 20 we but the Russell is below it so you could see something happen very very similar in crypto where Bitcoin goes to its 20 we and when it does if and when it does then maybe alts go below it right that could could very well play out sometime after the having whether you get a rally to the 8we SMA or not right and again I don't know um if we're going to go to the 8 week ese next week or if it's going to be like you know a month later I could easily come up with a reason for either scenario easily easily it it's going to depend on what your bias is um so I I really I really can confidently say I don't know which one's going to play out but I will say that regardless of whether you get a relief to the 8we or not my expectation is that Bitcoin will go to the 20we moving average within the next few weeks right you know within probably either this month or next month is my guess I mean it's been a long time right I mean it seems like we're due for it in 2019 you know it it took about 25 weeks you know something like that in you know 2020 or so all the way through 2021 we fell back into it in in May in fact and that was about 32 weeks we're currently at what 26 weeks right so my guess is you know sometime in the next 6 weeks we're going to find ourselves at the bull market support band and then we'll see what's up again my guess is that if if Bitcoin sort of chops around in this range for a few months that's what should send the Bitcoin dominance to 60% right so if it goes down to the 20e Ese and then it bounces back up for a little bit to the 8we ese or vice versa goes to the a week first and then goes to the 20 week it's that chopping process that should break the altcoin market down and I mean you can see it already happening you know with eth Bitcoin which is something we've been following you know for a long time you know it's now at 0482 now it is you know talking about this sort of stuff on the the sort of the cusp of a major Bitcoin event you know there could be counter Trend rallies for this stuff but again you know my guess is that eth Bitcoin is is just sort of doing something like this after breaking down where it it sort of TR to hold on for a week but inevitably it keeps on bleeding into into the summer months where maybe it finally can potentially bottom so that is my view here going into into the having remember if there is a larger drop in the crypto verse uh following the having whether it's immediately after or whether it's delayed by a few weeks one thing to remember right one thing that I I I think you should remember is that when you measure things from the peak and you go Peak to Peak Bitcoin is ahead of schedule by a lot right it really is it can afford to give back a lot of that and still be in line with prior Cycles we've said that forever this is why I've said Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio because it's going to outperform the altcoin marketing till QE Returns the problem for alts you know I'll tell you the problem for alts is that if Bitcoin just drops back down here to get back in line with the prior Cycles just like last cycle it dropped back in line to get to get back in line with its prior cycle if Bitcoin drops here to get back in line with the last two cycles guess what alts can go back down to their lows or they can put in new lows because they're not that far off of their lows to begin with whereas Bitcoin is right you know Bitcoin is already well off its low whereas the alts a lot of them are not now some of them are but a lot of most of them are not really that far off of their low so I mean you know if you see a situation where Bitcoin just simply goes back to where it you know where it was in the last two cycles at this point that's how the altcoin market can put in you know a lot of alts can put in new lows even in the having year and we saw that happen last cycle as well and and I know there's always going to be some type of reason for it or justification or rationalization but that is just what I've seen you know cycle after cycle after cycle is that alts can get that bounce in the prehab year but inevitably as you get later on in the business cycle and we get you know as the Market is really starting to digest all those rate hikes and and the FED refusing to Pivot sufficiently that's where alts you know the order books are thin and that's where they just continue to slowly bleed uh not only on their USD pairs but also their Bitcoin Pairs and then my guess is that once you start getting multiple weekly closes by Bitcoin below its 20we moving average I think there's a good chance that at that point Bitcoin dominance has topped but between now and then I think that you're going to see it you're going to see Bitcoin USD sort of chop around in this range for a couple of months um and during that time I I think the Bitcoin dominance will go uh to 60% as eth Bitcoin goes to 003 to 04 and and all Bitcoin pairs go all the way back down from 0 42 to where they currently are down to about .25 best case scenario and that's if you want to say that they're oscillators right so back down to 0.25 or so so that is is really my view right now on the market um there are also sort of other views that you could look at that sort of revolve around if it wants to follow some of the prior you know the prior Trends with some major geopolitical events we did see Bitcoin over here you know put in some scary Wicks back in early 2022 um and then they still swept the local high after that so there is always a chance that something like that happens as well um so be ready for anything uh but I I do think that the market would greatly benefit from a a summer lull where it just kind of gets boring for a little while and all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out that's what I think would be the best case for the cryptoverse is a a summer where all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out because no one cares anymore you know all the hype is behind us and then then you start to see them find their true lows on their Bitcoin pairs you know for everyone who is who's laughed at the idea of the devaluation of all Bitcoin pairs they just put in a new low last week right they just put in a new new low last week so don't laugh at it I mean this is just what happened last cycle you know it's just exactly what happened and and if they do come back down here like over here then I I think there's no debating anymore that it it really is following sort of what 2019 was it's just that the reason why it was delayed until the having year was because rate Cuts occur potentially now in the having year as opposed to the preh having year like last cycle so to me it all looks like it's playing out in a very similar manner where all Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows just before rate Cuts arrive the onset of rate Cuts potentially as early as this summer should allow a Bitcoin pairs to bottom out and then a USD pairs can find whatever low they're going to find um based on how how low Bitcoin goes and then perhaps by the last rate cut uh then you start to see it go the other way the biggest Counterpoint to all these views is if it's a um you know if we just get some manic blowoff top or something this summer uh following some type of left translated cycle I mean you could have a left translated cycle where the top is is March right I mean that's what happened in the dot crash right I mean that the top was in March of the election year that's not really my base case though um but I I would say I would say that if you are to get a left translated cycle where Bitcoin just goes parabolic into all the um into all the bad news and everything then you know then that would sort of invalidate the views that I'm expressing um my base case though is that we are just simply repeating what we saw uh back over here and all Bitcoin pairs should come down as we get into this summer and and by you know maybe by June July something like that I I could see all Bitcoin pairs finally bottoming out not withstanding Maybe some future Bitcoin parabolic rally which we saw over here but that is is you know really my view on the market right now and we will see if it if it continues to pan out or not in the meantime bitcoin's at 64k um and we'll see if it if it goes to the 20we estimate in the next couple of weeks or if instead it first rallies back up to just above or just around its 8we moving average um uh first but either way I do think we are due for a test of the bullmark sport band here in the next you know month month and a half if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the crypts premium at intothe crypto.com we have tons of charts thousands of different charts for a lot of different cryptocurrencies if there's a lot of cryptocurrencies that you have that you

we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the having if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom the sale will be ending just after the having so make sure you check it out and lock in the lower rate let's go ahead and jump in the Bitcoin having is probably one of the most significant events in our industry I often find people debating every cycle you know whether the having is priced in or not whether it has an effect on pric or not my view is that you know we've had three having before we had one in 2012 one in 2016 and of course one in 2020 and I I certainly do think that the having does play a role in the cycles of the crypto verse um I also think that monetary policy plays a role but I don't really fall in either Camp completely I don't think that it's only based on supply side stuff and I don't think it is only based on you know monetary policy I think it's a combination of of different things markets are complex um they're they're based on a lot of different things and so because the having is one of the most important events I wanted to do a video where we talk about it and talk about where where I have previously said that theit the price of Bitcoin may be now price predictions are honestly something that I'm not super into um because usually you know usually price predictions don't really turn out that great if if you put in a price prediction and it goes above it then you know the comments aren't so nice and if you put a price prediction and we don't quite get there you know people are also upset but I wanted to to revisit something that I said four years ago and kind of see like where are we with respect to that so four years ago I put out this video Bitcoin Fair valuation at the next tabing in 2024 I put out this video in 2020 in May of 2020 the price of Bitcoin was around $8,000 and what I said back then was that if we follow the fair value logarithmic regression trend line then by the fourth having which is the having that's about to occur the price to bitcoin would be between 40 to $50,000 okay that's what I said back then clearly we are above that price right clearly if we go back and look at the video that I put out a year ago or no this was at the end of 2022 um or mid 2022 just before the the the um the final collapse occurred I also sort of Drew it out going to around a 40 to 50K so with Bitcoin right now at 63k it's ahead right I mean there's no denying it it's ahead of where I said it was going to be back then now of course back then putting out a price prediction four years later um and and hoping that it would be accurate at all was probably something I was fairly naive about uh but here we are 4 years later and the price of Bitcoin is actually above the target range that I put and it's also above this area that I put as well going into the having and so with that in mind I I want to discuss a couple of things that that may come up after the having um that could very well uh take some people by surprise now there's a lot of different thoughts to this current cycle with it being you know so hot at this point in the cycle we've never seen the market put in new highs before the having right this is the first time ever that Bitcoin has put in new highs before the having and so that was you know probably one of the reasons why back then I I didn't think it would be quite so high but we are at new highs before the having and so I just want to talk about what you know what to potentially expect after the happing now there's two different trends of thought here one of which is a left translated Peak okay now to be completely honest I'm not really in the left translated Peak camp but it does have like maybe 40% of my attention and the reason for that is if you were to take the ROI of Bitcoin from Peak to Peak and you take it from the April Peak Peak instead of the November 2021 Peak and you compare it to last cycle it sort of looks like it potentially could form into a peak sooner rather than later in which case you would get a left translated top meaning the the the actual top occurs way before anyone thinks it will historically Bitcoin has topped out in the fourth quarter of the post having year so if you look at Major Peaks that Bitcoin has had in the past if I were to get an arrow here you can see that this top was in Q4 of the post having year this one was in Q4 of the post having year and this one was in Q4 of the posst having Year we're currently in Q2 of the having year so you know that is is still about six quarters away when Bitcoin typically tops but again so far this cycle is anything but typical with Bitcoin putting in new before the having so if it is to translate into a left translated Peak a left translated cycle then it would be more likely that the top would occur in 2024 as opposed to 2025 if we are going to follow that then I have to imagine that we would follow potentially what happened last cycle now it's not really my base cas but again it would be foolish not to at least acknowledge the similarities but on the other hand where I would say 60% of my attention is right now is what if this cycle is just like prior cycles and we are all over here jumping through hoops trying to explain why this time is different when potentially it just Peaks when it normally does and one way that we could go about getting to that point would be that if we had a cool off in the summer okay now there's no guarantee and if we follow this path then you might see the exact opposite of a summer lull but if there is a summer lull then one thing to keep in mind when you look at the last two cycles as measured Peak to Peak you can see that at this point in the cycle Bitcoin was only up or it was it was actually still about 60% down from its all-time high now I want you to think about that for a minute in both prior Cycles at this point as measured Peak to Peak Bitcoin was 60% below the all-time high 60% below it now right now Bitcoin is not 60% below the prior high in fact 60% below the prior High would put Bitcoin all the way down at around $26,000 that's how accelerated we are this cycle look at the last cycle 60% down from that Peak you can see that by May of 2020 that was when the having occurred Bitcoin was down 60% from the high and then if you go back to the cycle before that this the that the having occurred in July if I remember correctly and if you go to July of 2016 you will see that Bitcoin was approximately down 60% from the high this having it's not right it's not 60% down from the high in fact it is at the high it's at the high which has never happened before so this has caused a lot of people to view this cycle as different from the prior ones and I have to tell you they make a fair point they make make a fair point and if you measure it from the April top you can kind of see that Bitcoin is doing just about what it always does at this point in the cycle if you take the April top as the more important top and of course there is evidence to suggest that the April top is the more important top for instance some of that evidence to suggest the April top is the more important top is to look at views to a lot of different cryptocurrency YouTube channels and to note that there were more views in the first half of 2021 than there were in the second half where Bitcoin basically just put in a lower high in terms of social activity but somehow a higher high in terms of price if you look at Bitcoin with respect to its 50e moving average one of the things that it does after every major cycle top is that it goes back down to the 50 we and then gets a bounce a dead cap bounce before ultimately capitulating we saw that happen over here as well go back to the 50 we get a dead bounce and then go all the way down this past cycle we did not see that exactly what happened was we went back to the 50 we and instead of it just being a dead cap bounce to a lower high which is what potentially that would have been we ended up getting a higher high which took a lot of people off guard now I was optimistic of a higher high but honestly I think because of for for wrong reasons you know and sometimes you get things right for the wrongs reasons and and it's important to take that into consideration so we can see that that happened right we can see that we went to the 50 we we got a bounce but that time it actually led to a higher high the even the intermediate bull market in 2019 had us bouncing off the 50 week at some point and so the 50 we today is at around 40K it's at 39.2k 39.3k which is interesting because again that is way below the current prices way below current prices and I have to imagine that if we do not evolve into a left translated top if we do not right so there's two op you know there's two options right we evolve into a left translated top where the peak occurs in 2024 or we evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 if we're going to evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 you really need to see Bitcoin cool off for a while and again as measured Peak to Peak you can see just how far quote unquote ahead of schedule this cycle is it's actually not that unfamiliar when you think about it the reason it seems like this time is different is because Bitcoin is at new all-time Highs but if you look at the last cycle there was a period where it too was well above its prior cycle but what eventually happened is it bled back down and basically got in line with the prior cycle and then still ended up showing diminishing returns okay and then it actually got ahead of that cycle again this is why a lot of people thought we were going to go to 300 K last cycle but it still was diminishing returns so I want to continue to put forth this idea that if we do not evolve into a left translated Peak sometime around the having and instead the market cools off going into the summer then you might just see something like this where it causes the cycle to just get back in line with prior Cycles now that of course could make a lot of people think that the cycle that the peak is over and and the Bull Run is is is completely done and and maybe they're right right but there is at least some evidence to suggest that that could be what is ultimately in store for us as we get lat into the cycle if you're not familiar with how the last cycle worked and why we what what happened when we bled back down here there's a number of things that really put Bitcoin back into a intermediate bare Market sort of you had a a quantitative tightening bull market and then a bare Market as rate Cuts arrived and then a QE bull market that topped in 2025 now take a a look at Bitcoin this cycle and see how it's doing something very very similar in the sense that it's had this major run during High interest rates you can see it's had this run during High interest rates and in fact if you were to look very closely at when the FED paused here and compare it to this you can see something very similar happened right it it fell just after the FED paused here it fell just after the FED paused and then it went up quite a lot but ultimately what happened is that it it found a local top as just before rate Cuts arrived and then it bled for a while before getting another bull run into the post having year now by the way the having is only four four days away so if we do come up and put in a new local high before the having or maybe around the having that still doesn't necessarily invalidate the idea of the market cooling off sometime after the having if the left translated Peak is not going to occur okay so again there's two thoughts you have a left translated Peak where us Deens just can't help ourselves and everyone just front run runs everything until until the consumer caves or the other idea which would support the idea of this time not being different would just for the cycle to get back in line now if the cycle gets back in line then maybe this view from four years ago of around a you know 40 to 50K Bitcoin by the fourth having isn't that far off I know right now if we were to go back to 40 to 50 okay it would probably feel like the world's falling apart for a lot of people but one thing to consider is that when when e I'm you know I don't know how I made it this far in the video without talking about it one thing to consider last cycle is that the 30% drop Bitcoin had pretty shallow drops during this QT bull market right pretty shallow drops and then eventually it finally got a 30% drop that 30% drop corresponded precisely to the point when eth Bitcoin broke down and eth Bitcoin just broke down below the summer 2022 low so if you were to get a 30% drop sometime after the having that would actually put you kind of right around that range that we said way back over here and in addition to that it would also get you Loosely backed in line with where the prior Cycles were so going into this Bitcoin having is certainly different in the sense that we've never seen a new all-time high before the habing if you were to go look at the risk metric of Bitcoin you will see that the risk on bitcoin has never been this High going into the having in fact the last time we went into the the the 20 when we went into the 2020 having the risk of Bitcoin was at 04 when you look at the 2016 having in July of 2016 the risk on bitcoin was 0.4 today the Bitcoin risk is6 so it's actually quite a bit higher than it was during the last two 3 to4 this time we find ourselves at 639 and only a few weeks ago the risk was in the 7 to8 risk band to give you an idea of what the 04 risk band would look like which is where we were going into the last two that's where the 04 to 0.5 wristband is that's where the price of Bitcoin was at the last two Habs and you can see actually that Bitcoin when those rate Cuts arrived right here had that correction back to the 100 we moving average now what's fascinating about that is that it would correspond to the prior breakout zone so I I I feel like there's two different ways that we can look at the market here here that make the most amount of sense number one is that this is not different from the prior cycles and we're kind of on track with where we should be and that could be viewed by maybe looking at the ROI after the after the low if you look at the ROI after the low and you compare this cycle with two cycles ago this is exactly where we were but you can see that it at this point it did cool off for a while and then did get a drop kind of um you know this was day 520 or so about you know a month and a half from now or so so you can view it like that or you can view it from the peak and still say we're where we should be based on uh based on measuring it from the April top right if you take this out Peak to Peak if you measure it from the April top we're pretty much where we should be but again I can't help but think are we are we are we doing the same thing again where everyone tries to come up with a reason for why this time is different but in reality it's not so my thought process on the matter is this as we go into the Bitcoin having if Bitcoin accelerates into the having and post having and into June right if it is something like that where you know over here in 2019 in fact before rate Cuts arrived it actually did rally in until June last year we had a a local top in April but then we swept the high in June if we get something like that where Bitcoin continues to go up throughout the summer then I would be more in tune with the idea of a left translated top where you get a top in 2024 as opposed to say 2025 however on the other hand if you get a low Top by Bitcoin here as rate Cuts arrive and then instead of you know and that could still include sweeping the prior high right but if you get a look kind of like we did over here with the spot ETF we we put in a new high on the day of the spot ETF for the cycle if on the other hand we see the market cool off into the summer and go to say the 04 to 0.5 wristband or even the 0. 3 to point4 wristband and we get the market more back in line with the prior two cycles then I I think that perhaps the base case should still be that the cycle is playing out just as it always has and you still could get a top in in late 2025 and in fact it was this very intermediate bare Market that kind of scared a lot of people off in fact what happens if something like that happens again where rate Cuts arrive and you go back down scares a lot of people off and then because everyone gets scared off the FED starts printing money again and then you get a QE bow Market I've said this before and I'll say it again there's two types of bull markets in crypto there's quantitative tightening bull markets that occur during periods when the FED is lowering reducing the assets on their balance sheet that's what we got in 2019 and that's what we've got over here and during those periods during those periods eth Bitcoin goes down eth Bitcoin goes down during QT quantitative tightening bull markets how many people for the last couple of years have said that eth outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market that's not true not without any disclaimer because as you can see bitcoin's been going up since late November of 2022 and eth Bitcoin has been going down the entire time so that is why I still think there is some evidence to suggest the cycle may play out like it always does rather than a left translated top I'm not completely unsympathetic to the idea of a left translated Peak there's a lot of really smart people out there that frankly provide a compelling case for it and I could honestly provide a compelling case for it I just showed you guys some of the different charts but if Bitcoin does not run into the highest wristbands the 0. N to one wristband this summer and instead it just cools off like it did back over here after the having it might scare a lot of people off but perhaps it's just doing what it did last cycle and it the only reason that the top the local the midcycle top came later was because rate Cuts came later this cycle than they did last cycle so you have quantitative tightening bull markets where Bitcoin goes up as e Bitcoin bleeds all Bitcoin pairs bleed and then you have QE bull markets that go where Bitcoin goes up as eth Bitcoin goes up so eth outperforms Bitcoin in a QE Market but not a QT Market there's two different different types of bull markets so that is a very important distinction and I think we've only received more and more evidenced over the last year that Bitcoin really is dependent somewhat on monetary policy because last September when eth Bitcoin came back down to to this area right here there were there were a lot of people that thought that it had bottomed because that's when it had bottomed in the last cycle Q3 of the pre having year this development here which is what I said was likely going to happen this development of the the devaluation of eth against Bitcoin shows that the market is very much dependent on monetary policy whether we want to believe it or not so if that is the case right if that continues to be the case then you very well could see a a repeat of what happened over here sort of an intermediate Lull in the market followed by because of rate Cuts right that occur during rate Cuts followed by the last rate cut which leads to a QE bull market where you maybe top out when you normally do in the latter part of the post tapping year so two different theories if you're new here that's what is you know has really been discussed over the last uh year or so is this cycle different is it not I honestly think if you if you have a bias on it you're going to find the evidence that you're looking for um I I think we we'll know soon enough we we'll know soon enough if Bitcoin cools off into the summer which it very well could we we've seen gold breakout just like it did in mid 2019 we've seen eth Bitcoin break down just like it did in mid 20 M mid 2019 all Bitcoin pairs still haven't broken down yet but if it cools off into the summer then it just seems like it's the same thing as last cycle it's just that the the midcycle top was nine months later about about n nine months later if on the other hand after the having Bitcoin just accelerates to the upside once again then I will have to uh I will probably say that there's more Merit to the idea of of a left translated top but that's what I'm looking at right now and so to just revisit my prediction back in 2020 what would be the fair value of Bitcoin at the fourth having of 40 to 50k I find myself today seeing a $64,000 Bitcoin 4 days before the having and I I can't think I can't help but think to myself wow back then when I made that prediction I thought it was a lofty prediction that frankly was maybe not you know not that likely to come true because you know when Bitcoin is at 8K and and it really hadn't done anything for a couple of years I wasn't really that optimistic um of of you know exactly how accurate this prediction would be come to find out I was too conservative potentially right I was too conservative so it just goes to show how difficult these markets are to predict um four years ago price of Bitcoin was at 8K I said fourth having 40 to 50 instead we find ourselves at 64 and what's fascinating to me is that if we were at 40 to 50K I think it would you know a lot of people would think the the world's falling apart when in reality that would have been what the fair value sort of suggested it would be and that chart that chart that you see in that video is just this chart right here um these regression bands here so at the last taing we were at the fair value that's the other thing that why I said 40 to 50K back then because at every prior having Bitcoin was at the fair value so in no the fit to non-bubble data so in November 2012 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to non-bubble data in July of 2016 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to quote unquote non-bubble data in May of 2020 Bitcoin was at its fair value fit to again quote unquote non bubble data theoretically I should have updated this chart because it does I think need to get updated every cycle I haven't really done it yet if I did update it it would just shift it down very very slightly but right now according to this chart the fair value is around um 52k 52k but if you if you were to refit it based on this data over here it would actually probably put the fair value somewhere between 40 to 50K which is why I said back over here like we'll have to refit it um and and it'll be around 40 to 50K so we're above that level right now if on the other side of the having or something we see that level just know that that is is is what the um you know the regression band would have ultimately suggested for this part of the cycle so those are my thoughts going into the Bitcoin having we will see what happens uh as the having comes around it's only four days away and and we will do an update in maybe a month or so we'll see what happened you know after the having if we just contined to rally on into a left translated top or if it cools off like 2019 and and we just kind of come back down and and cool off until until the last rate cut arrives if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs

The Bitcoin Halving' by 'Benjamin Cowen' released on 2024-04-18 00:00:00\\nvideo url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS-ramvvRFU\\n\\nHi, this is NFA live this should be a relatively exciting show for two reasons first of all we have the Bitcoin having coming up in just about a day and we also have a new guest with us today Max from because Bitcoin uh how you doing great thanks so much for having me Ben yeah and you started you started doing this a year or two ago is that right yeah probably about 18 months ago officially yep all right yeah so max is um I've known him basically since probably before he even started the YouTube channel or right around the time that he started it uh so make sure you guys go subscribe to him and Rob as well uh links to that are in the description below so make sure you guys check that out and we're just going to go through a lot of the different questions that I think would probably be on people's minds as we go into the having uh so let's just go ahead and jump in Rob we'll start with you on this one the having is tomorrow it's tomorrow we've been waiting forever here it is fourth having um and I'm guessing it's going to garnish some attention should be making some headlines different places I'm curious what what effects do you think the having will have on the larger crypto space um do you think it'll bring new eyes to the scene or are we still kind of just uh you know the same old same old people just kind of hanging out um do you think it'll it'll actually bring new new people to the space uh we saw a lot of new people come to the space last cycle sometime after the having um or do you think it'll be quiet for a while and do you see any narrative shifts after the Havoc that's a pretty loaded question first of all I would just like to say that Max has a great background I'm sure he got to the same place I did which is fivr and uh hopefully he didn't get ripped off but it looks great and uh I gotta tell you one of these days max we're gonna have to put that into an nft just me and you so yeah yes that is my old green screen but I'll be jumping in that green screen as soon as the uh as the Bitcoin hits 100K But to answer Ben's question which I think is is what uh everybody wants to really try to figure out is this Bitcoin having and I know like there's a lot of first of all that I still believe in the fouryear cycle some people say that it doesn't really register I still and some people will talk like Bob Lucas will say well it's just left translated and we're going to see a big blowoff top in 2024 which could very well happen but I still think that the narrative around it and there's still a lot of people say well there's Mass adoption coming and it's already here I still think it's I mean I don't think that we're at the same level like we should be and what we could be in like 2028 or 2032 or you know time comes up but Ben if you get to show my my screen real quick because everyone wants to know like well the Bitcoin having and you did a great I I watched your your video Ben about uh uh the ethereum evaluation ethereum ethereum valuation of Bitcoin about how you know Bitcoin dominance is going up and how it's wreaking havoc and it's true it is right now I know people will will also talk about you know like hey well you know these things happen leading up to the having but if we take a look back this is from Smart Valor it's a good website and if we take a look they did all the work for him which is great this is how Bitcoin behav in the year leading up to each having because we had one of course in 2012 2016 then 2020 and I know people will say well there's always a dip there's always this massive dip before the having and there could be I mean we saw one pretty massive one in 2020 but of course there's a reason for that and and we could either say like it's because of the of the almighty Corona virus or it was something else but yeah there was a dip in 2016 but again just take a look at this so with having with the having one in 2012 the year leading up to the having it went up to 385 per. and the year after of course because we always see alltime highs the year after so far it went up 5,000% having two in 2016 leading up to it 142% now there's dips along the way and we're seeing that right now but then a year after that in 2017 2 84% in 2020 even though there was a turbulent year like we talked about it was still up 17% for the year getting into that having in May I think it was May 12 2020 and then it went up almost five almost 600% the year after that and we can see here that that yeah same thing happened the year leading up to to the having on November 208th 2012 this is what Bitcoin was 250 and then of course we come up and then you can see right here that yes there is a a drop before that and then it comes up and there's a drop before but it's like the same thing as like a bull market so we're seeing the same thing kind of Replay I know it's a funny thing because like Ben you'll say like uh you say hey I I I told you that the Bitcoin ethereum evaluation was going to start to start to lose momentum or actually bleed away to ethereum and then people were going to blame a Black Swan event and they never would have saw it coming but here we are and again same thing happens here 2015 a year going into it yes it's not a straight line but we kind of I mean really rallied into it there's you know dips along the way but I mean it's going in that right direction and then of course 2019 to 2020 we started at 7325 we had it kind of flat and then we saw the almighty Corona virus right here but then we rallied into it so I still feel like the same thing's gonna Happ happen that's just how I see things and I'm I'm feeling pretty good about this having so far but the big question is and and we we'll talk about this later is what's the macro is there going to be quantitative easing or more quantitative Tiding are they actually going to cut rates are we going to have the liquidity that we absolutely need which we had beforehand even though we're in quantitative uh tightening right now I mean we still rallied pretty well but can we get that liquidity back in the market and that's I think that's the big question on top of the fact of are we going to see World War II so yeah that's where I got yeah it's interesting because you know at some point you would think we would need to make the shift from quantitative tightening to quantity to quantitative easing but what needs to trigger that shift is the is the is the thing that I I think we're kind of wrestling with um someone asked where a guy was I I should have mentioned that he's he's in Dubai and I mean there's obviously a lot of stuff going on right there going on right now there with the conference and um everything so he wasn't able to make it this week um so um Max I I'll put the same question to you I mean like what are your thoughts here on the Bitcoin having um is this just kind of the same old thing that we've seen before and everyone's trying to over complicate it uh do you see any kind of shifts coming after after the having what are your thoughts yeah I I would agree with the with the last part I think that a majority of people and it's very easy to do this I I tend to do it all the time is to sort of chronically over complicate something that has for over a decade now been a pretty reliable uh we'll just we'll call it a risk on event and in the simplest of terms all you need to do is you know pull up your trading view chart and Mark out every single Bitcoin having right you need at this point you know you need to draw four vertical lines whenever a Bitcoin having has occurred look at the the price action that has basically come almost immediately following so um you know I I try to look at this thing from Every Which angle you know I look at it from the side I look at it up side down I you know I try to include the macro and and fed policy in all of my decisionmaking but um you know the truth of the matter is this is a very unique time to be in the markets right Bitcoin is now on the global stage in my opinion for the first time um there is you know new on-ramps into crypto you know specifically being these you know nine ETFs um and it is you know there's more regulatory Clarity the accounting standards have shift did in a positive light and are working to you know become more friendly for corporations and big money to actually onboard into this digital commodity if they choose to do so um but again like Rob had mentioned and Ben like you commented on there also are some macro headwinds which can only be ignored for so long unfortunately I am of the belief that we do still have some time I believe we're maybe on borrowed time some people probably don't like to hear that but but I do believe that there is this this unique pocket of time where it's all coming together and we can really see risk perform um positively of course I don't have to tell you guys this and I probably don't have to tell the audience this but historically during a Fed pause until something has quote unquote kind of broken and we see Unemployment uh you know trending above 4% and the FED actually has to step in and begin easing through you know interest rate cuts and other measures um we can actually see risk you know being stocks and now crypto performed tremendously well and you know going back to you know to the last cycle you know we actually kind of went through a little mini fed cycle here and you know 2018 2019 and 2020 um you know where Bitcoin actually the floor kind of gave out we dropped to about 3K and then we had that famous rally into June of 2019 when we topped um you know there was actually hikes going into that and then of course right as Bitcoin basically topped in June of 2019 the FED began to actually cut rates um more or less right after that and it did dramatically affect Bitcoin some will say you know it was a reflexivity and you know we had to you know we we sprung hard off of that local floor so you know of course the market corrects to the downside some will say it's covid some will say it was in the charts the whole time some will say it's not I don't know you know nobody knows whether it would have happened with Co or or without um but again I don't think that this time really is that much different I think that every cycle has some distinct differences from from a previous one I mean for example last cycle we had a double top we haven't had a true double top before we have had a cycle like the 2013 one where we had you know two pronounced Peaks but a true double top had never happened before and additionally in the bare Market we had never spent as much time below the 200 WEA as we just did coming out of this most recent bear so there are you know of course Very recognizable and notable differences of every cycle but you to answer the question Point Blank I don't think that this time is much different and I I'm trying my best to not overthink it um and say you know what there is no reason for the FED to intervene at this point we're trending in that direction and we are on borrowed time there is a Day of Reckoning coming but I do believe at the earliest it's probably sometime in Q4 we have the having you know in less than two days and I do believe that there's plenty of room for risk to run in the short to Middle term maybe going out six months okay yeah no I mean it's great to get you guys opinions um and the market has been on an absolute tear I mean essentially after since October right I mean it was pretty boring summer last year but then since October uh the market has basically just been up only up until the last few weeks but um you know the next thing I'd like to talk about is of course Rob's absolutely favorite topic and it's of course Bitcoin dominance um and you know I you know you guys know My Views but I always like to get other other views because you know I'm I it's it's a good idea not to live in an echo chamber so Bitcoin dominance has once again broken a new highs I I we saw 57% actually it came really really quickly really quickly you know that that move to 57% it's kind of cooled off back you know it's back down to like the 55 like 55 and a half or so so it has cooled off quite a bit since that rally up to 57% uh so uh Max I'll start with you first on this one do you think it's going to keep going up after the having um you know it was it it was going up into the spot ETF and then it kind of waned a little bit following the spot ETF but then it just kind of picked right back up so what do you think is gonna happen this time and and this kind of goes to the whole like the last question as well like will there be a narrative shift and what people are focused on will they will they start focusing on more things besides you know sticking with Bitcoin um do you see you know what are your thoughts on that Max well first I have to give you a compliment Ben because you were one of the few people that with a big following publicly called Bitcoin dominance rallying to this point I didn't expect it to get up to I think it topped at what 57 recently or wherever did you you deserve a lot of credit for that well I'm known for riding Trends too long see well we'll see right nobody knows besides the market right like you know we we all have our our inclinations but uh you deserve a lot of credit because I remember months and months AG I don't it was probably six months ago plus we did a space together or you came on on my my channel because Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance was significantly lower and eth BTC was significantly higher and much has changed since then so kudos to you where do I think it goes from here so I think that Bitcoin dominance is in the process of we'll call it distribution okay I believe believe that the meat of the move is over um but that does not preclude it from going a little bit higher than here maybe maybe 60% that's not my base case but you know let's let's look left on the chart and you know use that to you know maybe forecast what could happen next so ignoring the you know whether this is a left translated cycle or an expedited cycle let's look at it contextually for where Bitcoin is at um you know from from a a p perspective right so Bitcoin actually has gone on to get above the previous cycle all-time high of 69k so most comparably again ignoring everything else but just pure levels on the chart pure you know where was the cycle High where was the cycle low you could probably compare Bitcoin right now to like December of 2020 okay if we just ignore everything else and say okay Bitcoin in December of 2020 went on to sweep the previous cycle all-time high of 197 it paused there for what maybe a month or or something like that it was chopping around altcoins got destroyed during that time right Bitcoin uncertainty like you always preach Ben uh when Bitcoin is uncertain alts get absolutely eviscerated and we are seeing that once again right so um again comparing this period of time to December of 2020 there is turbulence under the previous cycle all-time high which is not uncommon we saw that again last cycle and then also two cycles ago it seems to be sort of the same thing happening again what did we see in December of 2020 well what we saw was Bitcoin dominance basically put in a deviation or bull trap High where on when Bitcoin finally decided it was time to push through with conviction above the previous cycle all-time high of 197 you saw Bitcoin dominance put in an explosive move which ultimately ended up being sort of a bull trap you know for for the Bitcoin Maxis um so I I think it's possible we are seeing that Devi that deviation high right now only time will tell um I do have hedges in place you know like I'm I'm holding some Bitcoin l2s like STX and some Bitcoin ordinals and things like that that I think would be beneficiaries of you know Bitcoin dominance continued rally maybe above 60% um but of course you know I I really I am of the belief that contextually with Bitcoin chopping under the previous cycle all-time high seeing similar signs of Bitcoin dominance putting in you know this this last explosive push I do believe that over the next six months or so it would probably makes sense to see Bitcoin dominance Trend down dramatically and additionally and and I don't mean to you know bring this up because I don't know if this is on the agenda today exactly I imagine that that would translate to eth BTC finding a bottom sooner rather than later but that doesn't again preclude it from going down a little bit more and only time will tell yeah no I mean it's great and I mean I I I think it's always worthwhile to hear these other views because um you know no one really knows right I mean you know no one really knows and you know one thing that I've wrestled with a lot before and I've seen other people do this too is like you know just because someone gets something right doesn't mean they're going to be right they're going to keep being right right and also just because someone gets something wrong doesn't mean they're GNA be keep being wrong I mean you know markets change no one knows what's going to happen and I I I could see eth Bitcoin carving out a bottom this summer um that's kind of my base case I could see that actually happening so we'll see if that happens Rob what are your thoughts I mean I know you're you're more of a you're more of a Bitcoin Maxi yourself right Bitcoin dominance to 100% I yes exactly go ahead Ben what was your question I'm just kidding I'm just kidding what what are your thoughts here on on on dominance do you think it's uh you think we're getting pretty close to the uh to the top well first of all let me just say that I I I was like listening to to Max especially on like the Twitter spaces and things like that he's very smooth in his delivery and very smart and and what he talks about so I gotta tell you it's good to hear like different sets of opinions it's great to have a Max here so to talk about I mean Bitcoin dominance I got to tell you like when you were talking the 60% I'm like yeah you know I can kind of see it you know I was I was I was under the assumption like well you know it always kind of comes back that way right something happens there's something that happens in the market a Black Swan event or you know something that's just that kind of has disruption and then people get scared and they're they're like okay I'm risk on but not that risk on to go into like you know Pepe coin I'm gonna go into the safest asset in the most volatile industry which would be Bitcoin and I I could see that for sure but then like there's a narrative that that people are always talking about especially in in in the crypto space being the Bitcoin maxos are going to say Bitcoin only right but there are narratives that are out there one of those is dpin Right centralized physical infrastructure Network the other one are dexes because we see what's going on with the centralized exchanges getting sued getting their pants sued off by the SEC and then leaving of course so we have to have dexes and then of course there's another big one which is web 3 so we talk about that but there's one that I feel is on an undertone and Max alluded to it when he was talking about it when he talked about runes and he talked about ordinals and he talked about things like stacks and l2s and I think what's gonna really push Bitcoin dominance up I know Ben loves this part too is uh the the l2s or even l1s that are going to be built on bitcoin Ben if you just throw this this chart up I always talk about this website it's l2. watch so imagine this and I and and and even like Adam back has talked about this how he's talked about he hates the fact that everybody's building off of Bitcoin people should just build on bitcoin because he says it's like it's it's like the tcpip layer for for the internet so why can't they just build on the most the safest most secured Network or computerized Network ever built in the entire world and he was right so when I take a look at these these l2s that are coming out and they're all new so you I to understand like this some most of these are trash let's just let's just call it SP Spade but like when we talk about things that are coming out that are actually doing pretty good like a Stax who's been around for quite some time I can really see things actually happening for sure and then like I just dropped a a video on my second Channel where I talked about core core is a top uh 50 well it's 56 now but it's essentially an L1 L2 type of uh uh token which is built right on top of Bitcoin using delegated proof of work and delegated proof of stake together to actually make dexes nfts and a whole host of things you can only do with smart contracts so when I see stuff like this happening I'm like why can't we take away the nonsense that's going on over in ethereum world and they're massive gas fees like just like with with core and stacks right now if you use it or the things that are being built on top of it they're just going through their Satoshi initiative it's super cheap and it's super fast so for me to see that Bitcoin dominance could go up why couldn't it especially with the different institutions that are here and how they've been drilled into it now they can say oh there's something else I can do and also smart I see it could actually go above 60% but again I'm not always right no I mean I I've it's possible it's certainly possible um I think the answer is going to probably come in the next few weeks because you know there's two prior examples where we had these kind of these like closes below the 8we ese 2021 and 2019 and in 2021 after it happened Bitcoin got a rally eth Bitcoin went up but in 2019 when Bitcoin got that rally eth Bitcoin went down so I think if we see Bitcoin get some type of relief I don't know maybe sometime after the having into may I I don't know exactly when it would be but whenever that comes whatever happens to eth bitcoin should be very telling about where we are in the cycle so I I'm going to be focused a lot on that um over the next few weeks but we will see um next question Rob I'm GNA start with you on this one to rotate and you know I remember last year you saying something like this um and and you ended up being correct it was basically you know sell and man go away um like I mean no one's D Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear since October I mean you know I mean it was basically like 25 to 30k not even that long ago um and I I think sometimes we forget just how quickly it has moved so I'm curious like do you think it's going to be similar to last summer where we just get the market gets boring before maybe moving up again like later in the year or something you think it's just going to get boring for a few months um do you think or on the other hand do you think everyone's gonna get think it's boring and then we just get another you know face what's it called like a face melting Rally or something that's exactly face yeah I mean like so so what are your thoughts going into the summer because I mean again I know last summer you you thought it was going to be boring do you think it's going to be boring again this summer or you think it's going to be different Matt well first of all I I hope so I I really do because everybody who's in the chat right now answer a question for me uh tell me if you think that you've accumulated enough where you're like you know what I've bought plenty of Bitcoin and I just cannot handle any more bags I just I don't want to buy anymore especially if it goes down and gets cheaper just let me know in the comment section because it seems like when these types of things Ben when you say things are boring this is great because this is when people who like the dollar cost average is fantastic or if you're Dynamic DCA is things go down which I think where we at the risk levels now 0.6 0.59 somewhere around there a little yeah I think a little above 0 six so like if we're in this place we're like well I mean for me this is a good time to just accumulate a little bit but as we start to like if it goes sideways well great I have more time to bring things in but then if you if you want to talk about selling May and go away there's this great chart on this website that I steal from constantly and if you just take a look because it's it's yeah it's a nice website it's very nice I think there's a sale going on until like tomorrow and then it goes away so but if if you say sell in May and go away it it actually works out pretty well I mean historically speaking but then if you really want to break it down because people say but Rob you don't get it because this is the having year so it's all it doesn't really it count well if you take a look at it I mean if you sold at the end of May of 2020 I mean you had a 30% increase on January a couple of drops there 34 and 10% and then you're down here and you just kind of stay away until October and then you buy in and then October rallies November rallies and December rallies that's not bad I mean I'll take that year right and if we go back to 2016 I mean it's the same type of thing if I want to sell in May okay well June's gonna go up but I have red red I take I stay away September as well and I I buy back in October November December I'm doing pretty good so I still think it can work out all right the thing that you have to understand though and one more thing is is this there's a presidential election I think this is going to be pretty tumultuous as we get into it so there was this piece from hbk's wealth and it talked about the presidential election years versus the non-election as far as returns and this is just taking a look at the S&P 500 you can see that in the presidential election years which this is that year it sends to like kind of peek off around March April and then just kind of fall away until we get into junisha may go away October is here you buy back in and then we have a nice little rally of course drop here and then off we go but 10% for that year is not too bad now does that mean that I'm going to sell everything no no I'm just telling you these are just the data points that we can say take a look at me personally I'm just here to accumulate and uh get into some early round type of cryptos that could either make a lot of money or go to zero one of those two will always happen yeah I was looking at this um this is uh this is the S&P 500 in 2024 compared to the average of all election years right I mean so you can see like it has come down a lot recently but it also went up a lot too like way more than it does on average so there's just been a lot more volatility this cycle than I think we've seen in a lot of Prior Cycles um but yeah I I thought that was interesting and that chart sort of reminded me of that uh Max what are your thoughts here I mean I know earlier you said you expected uh risk to do pretty well um over the next six months but you know even with that do you think that the market could cool off before that phase or do you think it's not going to really get much of a breather or do you think the Breather is almost over yeah that's it's a it's a great question of course we're all from relatively familiar with the uh maybe cliche but overused but also kind of accurate saying of sell and may go away um one thing that I've been preaching for a while going back to I mean even I would say Q4 of last year is that I was seeing signs early on of a maybe expedited cycle for crypto um and it's probably off of of you know the back of this this fed paw and there isn't quite as much in my opinion economic deterioration as a lot had thought myself included and we're in this you know kind of Goldilocks window where risk can rally really unencumbered um you know so so do I think that selling may go away will come to fruition I I would think that worst case in my opinion from what I'm seeing right now and again of course subject to change it's just one man on the internet's opinion I think that similarly to how this cycle for crypto is being a little bit front Rand and we've actually seen for the first time a Bitcoin all-time high before a having which of course had never happened before um I also think it's possible that selling may go away is being front ran a little bit and we're seeing that right now with this April correction so similarly to Rob I am not I am not in the camp of you know drisking or selling spot because again like I mentioned in you know during our first question here if you just draw four vertical lines on your trading View and Mark out every Bitcoin having look what typically happens in the six to nine months following Additionally you know for a lot of us that have been slowly you know and thoroughly meticulously dcing into our digital digital assets and our unregistered Securities over the past year you know a lot of us have tax consequences for selling right now and I'm I'm not really interested in incurring any uh you know tax consequences trying to reposition because May perhaps is a little bit choppy so in my opinion you know and again going back you know the past 18 months for Bitcoin we haven't seen more than a 22% correction on bitcoin so from our local high recently take it down 22 to 25% maybe you get 57 56 worst case that's not enough for me to incur you know a taxable event to try to reposition so uh maybe it happens maybe it doesn't but for me ultimately it doesn't make a big difference because the having is in a couple days um and typically what happens after a having is months and months of prosperity and hopefully price discovery yeah no it's a fair point I mean I think like all the corrections that we've had by Bitcoin for the entire bull market have only been about 20 to 22% yeah we've already seen it go down about what 18% or so um so that I think that'll be the the area I mean if we get down there see if it turns around and if it does maybe the time's not different you know but yeah what do you think Ben do you think selling May and go away will come to ahead um I think now I mean so I so we went into the 7 to point8 risb in March so that I think was the time to to drisk some kind of like during the spot ETF um at this point it's kind of like when we went back to 39K after the spot ETF um we then it was it was a 22% drop and then we just rallied after it right and and so I was like you know this could be our preh having year dip and then the rally just continued and so now it's kind of the same thing it's like you know the the area to do it if you were convinced about it would have been in in March you know um when gold broke out because that's actually in 2019 when Bitcoin topped was when gold broke out um so I think that would have been the time to do it now I do think there is a risk of if you've waited if you've waited till this point and now bitcoin's down 20% we did see both in after the 20209 or the 2019 top and the 2021 top the first weekly close bow of the 8we SMA we then had a rally back up you know to the we right which is around 67k we actually went slightly above it in both cases so I think what what's more important is not exactly what happens here at the range lows but it's what happens whenever we get a relief move does it sustain or does it just put in a lower high I think that is kind of the thing to look for because back in after the spot ETF it wasn't a lower high we just you know had another face ripping rally fire um the the reason why I am more cautious on this one than than the last one is because eth Bitcoin has now broken down and gold is broken out which both of those events marked the 2019 local top and it wasn't the market cycle top and this kind of goes back to what Rob was saying you know there is this idea of a left translated peak in 2024 and I can sort of like I'm like 30% maybe 40% aware of that like you know thinking hey this is this could actually happen you know if if we were to Rally into the summer to higher prices without cooling off then I would be very more so convinced of a left translated Peak but what if what if if you think about what happened after the 2019 top after gold broke out and after e Bitcoin broke down Bitcoin went into a six to n month bare Market in fact now imagine you get that after the having and everyone thinks the cycle is over by the end of 2024 because it just hasn't done anything since the having and then we just get another move in 2025 and then the cycle Peaks when it always does and once again everyone over complicated it you know like there is a chance that that that happens um so I would I think I would just watch to see what happens whenever we get any type of relief does it form into a lower high or does it lead to a higher high and then you probably have your answer to whether it's a left translit cycle or not at that point I can see absolutely yeah and again even in 2019 it was it was just a local top we bled for a while we actually bled back to the 100 we SMA um and then and then we started to go back back up and then we had the we had the pandemic crash but if you ignore that it was just sort of a bleed after all Bitcoin pairs broke down and then and then once we got that back you know we start to go back up those are my and and by the way I mean you've always said this going back when you know before I started my business and I was watching all of your videos you know years ago Ben you used to always say something kind of along the lines of you know the longer it takes you know the higher will ultimately go something along those lines and you know I think a uh this idea of a prolonged sort of midcycle Correction freaks a lot of people out because everybody wants to be rich overnight myself included right of course i' I'd love for us to just go straight up in a straight line and I hope that we do but ultimately I don't think it would be a death sentence for Bitcoin to kind of reestablish value between 55 and 75k for even a full quarter um you know I think ultimately would probably lead to more constructive uh price action to the upside in the long run but people you know their patients will be tested no question yeah yeah I mean I think the the the thing to look for in the cycle I think is is the Bitcoin dominance I I really do think it's the key for the cryptoverse and I think I think that dominance will Top before Bitcoin Falls below the 20we SMA that's my guess is that it's going to top before Bitcoin Falls below it and I think between now and then Bitcoin gets occasional rallies that just take off Bitcoin pairs even lower is my guess um so that's why I just say like you know if you want exposure to crypto Bitcoin I mean you know Bitcoin is is a relatively safe bet if you want to take on more risk there's obviously the altcoin market there's the full DJ mcoin Market um but you have to be careful with those and I I I think the winning strategy with the altcoin market and and even if you are in the riskier memec coin stuff is just to remember like in five years that Meme coin is probably not going to exist No One's Gonna care about it because they're going to be worried about the next stage of mean points right so the way the way to navigate it is it's okay to have exposure to various parts if you want to take more risk but just occasionally convert it back to bitcoin if you make a lot of money right because at least you know you then know hey Bitcoin is still going to be around in 10 years I don't know if this random meme coin is Ben how could you say that how dare you my a meme coins oh my I think I've converted most of my audience to bitcoin Maxis at this point but I will say by the time I convince the last person to be a Bitcoin Maxi that's when the dominance tops out and we go back the other way I don't think we're that far away I think maybe this summer dominance tops out we'll see though but you are correct like what anybody out there like if we're being completely honest Would You Bet Your Life that Your Meme coin or your altcoin is going to be around in 50 years would You Bet Your Life on it I probably would not would I bet my life I mean it's an extreme example right would I bet my life or something valuable that Bitcoin will be around bet your would you bet all your money on it or something right that's much more friendly right so and I would for Bitcoin I have a high degree of confidence and that's why your strategy ultimately it's conservative you know relative to a lot of other people that you know talk about crypto publicly but it is ultimately a long-term winning strategy and people need to recognize that profits from altcoins ultimately do have to flow back into Bitcoin that is the sustainable strategy for sure yeah I mean I think Rob I think Rob was talking about this what last week on NFA live we were talking about like what do you do when you get an airdrop and I think what was your strategy like just 50% you take profits on it right away 50% back to bitcoin or USD and then you let there oh no no it was you let let it go up 2X or something or if it goes up 2x then you sell 50% was that what you said yeah I I call it well two things I call it the half and half method so you get into meme coins or something crazy and then let's say you put it you know 100 bucks in and then it goes $200 so then you sell half immediately and you put the other hundred bucks let it ride because that's house money then when it doubles or triples or or quadruples then you take half again or you take two or three or 4X what do you want to do and then you let the ride and you do that until there's no more riding and it just goes away and then you're like well okay I I did 8X but it went to zero so I don't feel so bad because a lot of people just let it go all the way up and all the way down but if you just play with house money there's a reason why like like I I can see people in the in the chats going well this sucks because you know now we're gonna sideways and you know this isn't what I want to be there's a reason why all three of us are pretty much just like on all of our videos on all of our Twitter spaces we're pretty much the same person whether it goes massively up or way way down me's a little bit of excitement but it's because we der risked enough to like well if this happens then we do this if this happens we do that and I think that's where people should would want to be as opposed to just going okay I sold my kidney I hope this memec coin goes up it's one of those things have a plan no matter what and then enjoy your life don't stress about it right I mean have a plan like you know if Bitcoin goes to 50K or even lower so what have a plan if it goes up have a plan I mean it I I think you know I used to navigate crypto without without thinking about like what do I do if this happens I only would navigate it based on one particular outcome I never hedge myself but once I started hedging My Views then it makes things easier you know you're like all right well this is what I think but if I'm wrong I don't want to be you know completely left out of whatever that next trend is um and when I when I get air drops um well I don't I don't really get air drops anymore because I'm not really that active in in the space but when I did when I used to get air drops my strategy was immediately convert half of it to bitcoin at least half to bitcoin and then let whatever else ride because like half the time they would just go to zero anyways um so at least you get some of that value out in inss um why don't we goe and move on because we do have two more questions and then I'd also like to get to audience questions at the end if you post your question now I probably won't see it so maybe wait like 10 minutes and then post it um this is an interesting question and I to be completely honest most people aren't going to care but gold is is one of these things where like it doesn't do anything for like 10 years you know and like if you think about this entire bitcoin's like like it's entire history essentially since 2009 gold has essentially gone nowhere in that in that entire phase but we just saw gold break to new all-time highs and it seems to be a somewhat explosive rally so I'm curious about what your thoughts are on gold um I I often think that people who like gold are are more alike to people who like Bitcoin than they would care to admit I think the main difference is the generation that we are right so if I were born one or two generations ago I probably would have been really into gold you know but because I'm born into more of the digital age I'm more into Bitcoin so I think we're more alike than different um so I'm curious like what your thoughts are on gold here it is now 2300 2400 um max where do you you know do you think that uh this is going to continue I me Silver is also not too far behind it in its own move um and I guess the other question is like why do you think gold is rallying so that's probably the bigger question is is why do you think it's rallying rather than like what do you think it's going to go to sure yeah the gold strength is um pronounced it's very impressive um and and I would say I mean why do people buy gold historically right it's sound money it was sound money before Bitcoin it was a store of value when you know our our parents generation was nervous about the state of the world they would you know convert their into gold and uh you know a lot of it is more of a um it's a mental thing it's a it's a mental insulation it's not like if your country was invaded you're going to put you know 500 pounds of gold on your back and somehow travel to another country right but it's a it's a peace of mind thing you know and you know again historically it is you know a sound currency uh there is a scarcity aspect to it there's a lot of commonality and overlap between gold and Bitcoin and I think everything you mentioned Ben is correct um I would say that my bias on gold um really stems more on my perspective and my my forecast on where I think dxy is headed and similarly where I think Bitcoin is headed I've already shared my opinion on where I think Bitcoin is going we have the Bitcoin having just around the corner um I expect Bitcoin to you Trend upwards aggressively over the next six to nine months subsequently I do believe that dxy is forming a sort of distribute you know a distribution here I do anticipate dxy topping very soon and again if you just overlay gold with dxy on a weekly chart you can see that there is a pretty prominent negative correlation between dxy and gold so I don't think we're I'm not of the opinion that we're going to see a decoupling where there's suddenly a a prolonged period of a positive correlation where gold rallies and dxy rallies I think that one of them is lying so either gold is lying or dxy is lying I think that gold is leading and going to see dxy of course sort of reclaim that negative correlation and begin to take a dive over the next quarter so um I do expect gold to continue upwards and I think it's probably off the back of the you know dxy weakening okay yeah fair enough um it has it has been really strong you know and I I can't help but look at it I'm like wow you have like a 10-year base I the bigger the base the more explosive the rally and for I mean for I know like all the crypto you know Deens are like you know it's up what like 10% or something and like people are like you know like 10% is like a minute candle on a meme coin right but for gold you know for an asset that's that high market cap like that is a big move in a really short period of time and so like that's why it it it means something Rob what are your thoughts here um are you are you are you watching this gold move I'm not watch I mean but I own it I own gold and silver and I I think and I don't I never UND and we talk about this many times I never understood why the old maximalists and this and the precious metal maximalists hate Bitcoin so much because like you said we're trying to all do the same thing we're trying to get out of the Matrix which is relying on paper Fiat and it just seems like I there's there's that one gold bug guy that is what we all talk about for some god- awful reason but in reality I think for the majority of people that are into precious metals I think they can see the value behind it and of of of Bitcoin itself and like I I like I never understood with this guy like why don't we have a debate between that guy and like Mike Maloney Mike Maloney is huge into gold he's put out a great series on precious medals and he's he likes Bitcoin as well so like when I take a look at this I I think you know why why not own why not old gold why not diversify like you know uh we've got I diversify not just in the crypto but the stocks precious metals and and real estate and I think everybody should do the you know kind of do the same thing but to talk about why gold went up so much let me I I don't know but how did gold do in 2022 was there any kind of rally during that time I mean it it it it still mostly stayed below the high I don't really think it did that well um it's only recently really started to show strength I mean I can I can pull it up and see but 2022 was kind of split it rallied in the first half of the year and then didn't really do too much and actually corrected a little bit looks like yeah I mean it looks like it topped in March of 2022 and then basically just went down yeah till November and then it rallied again into December kind of there there's a theory going around about why Gold's rallying so much it's because the Nations that are going to war they are trying they're fearful of us sanctions so how do how do you get away get around those sanctions well you stockpile Alternatives and one of those would be of course gold so people are talking about how Iran could be could have stockpiled after the Damascus situation and the and the bombing and the reason why I ask about 2022 is because for the Ukraine Invasion I think was February 2022 and the same type of thing was being said about Russia stockpiling gold at the same time so I can see I can kind of see that that valuation I don't know why they don't just use Bitcoin it's a heck of a lot easier to transfer and zip around value but that's where we're at yeah I always like I always think those posts by the gold bugs are so disingenuous because I mean like I I own both like I own Bitcoin and gold but like if you go to trading View and you look at the Bitcoin or you look at the Gold valuation against Bitcoin it's down so much since Bitcoin launched that it rounds it to negative 100% like like that's how far the valuation of gold has fallen against Bitcoin since Bitcoin has been around so again like it's not it's just look I mean the the Bitcoin valuation as far exceeded gold for a long time um I mean my guess is over the next 20 years Bitcoin will still outperform gold you know maybe in the short term gold could outperform uh Bitcoin but and I I mean I guess it has been since March right ever since gold broke out Gold's been doing better than even the S&P 500 even the NASDAQ um it's been having my view is that I I I think that gold is breaking out because it senses that um rate cuts are coming sooner than the market is potentially thinking and so that's kind of why I think I I think it's sort of sniffing something out just like it did in 2019 and and um but we'll see I mean you know we'll see if it if it plays out in the same way last question and I mean I you know this is more so geared towards Max um because I mean Rob is I mean you know you've been around here forever we' probably even asked this question you before yeah but I mean if you want to take it if you want to answer you can Max Max yeah so since you're new here um why did you start your YouTube channel I mean like what what was your motivation what are you helping to accomplish with it uh what brings you here well Ben you you actually played a big role in in bringing me here I was a very early follower of yours actually before you even had your website I bought your Google sheet way back in the day and I'm still locked into my original price thank you very much because I got in early pays to get in early um you know I I learned a lot from you in the very beginning and I went through last cycle and you know Ben and and Rob also this you know this is a compliment to both of you guys amongst a sea of grifters and thieves and people looking to prey on unsuspecting retail you know guys like yourselves you you conducted yourselves in a manner that you know I mean I can't even imagine how many millions of dollars you guys turn down from shill deals and you know crap like that and you know I I wanted to in the beginning play my you know play my part in that I felt as though I had opinions that you know um I could share something to offer I have you know I have an ability to lead I have you know an ability to organize a team um and I wanted to play my my part my equal share in the sort of collective hive mind of you know CT and and YouTube and help educate that's sort of the underpinning of of what I'm doing is I like to teach I like to collaborate and you know making money certainly feels nice right but there's a certain there's a certain sense of fulfillment that I personally get out of somebody messaging me saying hey because of what you said it made a difference in my life and something clicked for me and that feels really good and you know I I started because Bitcoin and it was it's a small Channel still um we're growing quickly certainly which of course if you go to Ben's beautiful website and you overlay social media growth with uh you know the price of Bitcoin you can see why I'm starting to grow quicker it's it's I'm doing the same thing I was doing all bare Market it's just suddenly more people care about crypto so um you know I am a i a result of good times and I pray that they continue on because of course it's you know a nice Tailwind for for my young business but yeah I mean really to answer the question Point Blank I love to teach I love to to collaborate and I love to debate you know like I have a differing opinion than you know you guys for some things and there's some overlap but that's what makes a market beautiful is that you can think one thing I can think another and we can come together and just talk about it politely and nobody knows what's going to happen right like we can't I have my hunch I have conviction just like you guys do but Bitcoin dominance could go to 90% And you know even over flip it and put that on on Twitter don't do that don't do that or or it could literally nuke down to 10% we could have like the crypto equivalent of the NASDAQ bubble between 1995 and 2000 where altcoins bubble like people you know can't imagine everybody's thrown money at altcoins speculating anything that's crypto and then 99 out of 100 of them don't exist in a couple years you know so who who knows what's going to happen but yeah I love to to collaborate and teach and debate and uh generally it's it's just a passion of mine how many subscribers are you guys at now like 13 14k or something yes on YouTube somewhere in between there yeah well there's 3,600 people watching so if everyone here goes and clicks the link in the description below and goes over to Max's Channel and subscribes then uh I I'm sure he would appreciate that and I think he deserves that he's been they've been putting out they it's not just Max by the way I mean it's a team of people um so go check that out you guys do like daily live streams right we Yeah we actually have a show coming up at uh 10:00 a.m. eastern time we do a Daily Show we've got a panel of Five Guys we're all just Traders wrap this one up then if you got it coming up in 10 minutes that's okay I got a big team they got it all right well before we before we end it here I I did want to take at least a couple of questions um and one of the questions I saw was um what is the best way to learn about crypto and to do your own research so I mean I don't know if they're talking about like from a fundamental perspective but I if someone were getting into crypto like like what do you guys use to do your research and I mean and maybe talk about like all the different tool or some at least some of the bigger tools that you guys have been using especially for all the different things that are happening in the cryptoverse there seems like there's a thousand different narratives that you could you know that you could follow and whoever wants to take that one is fine go ahead Max yeah um I would start on uh one of our three channels I think that's a really good place not to not to spew the obvious but um I would say I would say learn to do very basic ta right and understand Cycles like there's some very awesome free indicators out there like I mean you can even just look at like you know Ben has a a you he's kind of coined a very famous one he's combined a 20 week SMA and a 21 we EMA which has been sort of uh marketed as the bull market band for good reason right so you can determine when you know Bitcoin is trending upwards High time frame or trending down by just a simple you moving average band there's also things like the P Cycle top which I think people should keep an eye on which is again a free trading view indicator someone someone made it it's also on Ben's website there's also some some good onchain stuff like you know Bitcoin terminal price hoddle waves things like that I would as a beginner I would stay off the hourly time frame like literally just go daily time frame and above um and whenever you see Bitcoin down you know 50% from its its all-time high that's time to start paying attention to maybe consider entering the market but you know learn very very basic ta and and some of the more popular onchain indicators can really help you just DCA at the right time you know but stay off of the hourly time frames mainly the py cycle top just to give credit is uh was developed by Philip Swift um a while back and I the the idea was to predict the top with within 3 days and it did a really great job of doing that in the first uh the first 2021 Peak um and it actually happened I remember it happening and like no one really believed it you know um but I think it was retrofit right it was fit after yeah it was created in 2019 it was created in 2019 okay but it did it did get the first top in 2021 I feel like a lot of these like metrics that everyone created in 2019 uh it they called the first top but then most of them like didn't really call the second top because it was just sort of like a it was like a dead cat bounce that just somehow made it to New highs you know yeah um so yeah that was kind of an interesting one um Rob did you have anything to add just yeah just one thing Max makes all great points the thing I would say is that if you really knew you really really knew you have to understand that it's not how much you make it's how much you keep and the big thing is that you have to watch out for scams and things to watch out for and if you're gonna get into like hot storage wallets stuff like that there's a there's a video in the in the link of in the description of all my videos and it says you know things you the the big mistakes in crypto and it has like 20,000 views and of course it's the most important video I probably have ever put out because that's what people get screwed out and they get scammed out and if they watch that video they wouldn't happen to them another video I did when I'm gonna sell on my crypto has over 100,000 views so it just goes to show you like where the priorities are the priorities are make money but really the priority should be keep money someone's asking a um this the Market's not pricing it in right now but I did see like last night there's been a couple of times here where like there's at least some in investors like thinking about a rate hike um that is not like my base case at all like I think they're done I I think five and a half percent is the terminal rate for this cycle they might go higher next cycle uh but I I think five and a half percent at the top I'm not going to ask you if you think they're gonna hike again because I don't really think any of us think they're going to um if you do think that let me know but I guess my main question is what do you think would happen if they did hike again um because that be I mean that would talk about markets not pricing it in right I mean like I guess the the implication would be like if if the economy just accelerates into you know again and and there's not a cool down and we just keep on moving up uh what would a rate what would another rate hike do well what was real quick what was what is what has Jerome Powell said about fighting inflation do they say that they're on the right track or do they say like there's it's more more stubborn what he they've kind of like the progress has slowed a lot and I I think they've kind of specul that it it might influence their the number of rate Cuts this year because previously they had said three rate Cuts this year and I'm I'm wondering if they're starting to walk I mean now the market is pricing in only two rate cuts through April of 2025 so I my view is that you know I thought higher for longer but now that everyone else believes it I think I think it's going to go back the other way because once the market fully prices in no rate Cuts that's when people give up and you need to start having some rate cuts um but yeah I don't know I mean pal Po's basically said the same thing he said for the last three years if you know they're they're going to keep rates higher for longer until inflation's durably going back to 2% yeah I I think that 3% is is the new 2% truthfully I I I appreciate their narrative and their consistency and and how they haven't wavered on that and I think it's a great goal um but it seems like three is kind of a magnet actually a little above three um like you mentioned they are currently pricing in now it looks like you know our first 25 basis point cut on the uh September 18th meeting and then through April 2025 and and these percentages change all the time right uh you know we'll see what happens um you know potentially taking us down 50 basis points off of where we're currently at um let me answer your question what would happen if we got another 25 basis point hike because you know inflation decides it's going to rear its ugly head again and and start trending up above you know headline four 5% God forbid it's over I mean like we are going to absolutely nuke if we get another rate I'm gonna be as as clear as I can be if we get another rate hike markets are going to capitulate like that will be awful horrible for risk like sell all of your assets honestly like if that happens I'm not joking I think it'd be terrible I don't know if you guys agree with me but that would be horrible for markets but I don't think that's going to happen to be clear I think you could have the same thing happen if they just refuse to cut soon enough too because like it it you know like a tightening cycle is not just raising rates but it's also keeping rates too high for too long and the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and eight would have been in March um so we've already gone nine I think there's still you know there's still a window where talks about a soft Landing right it's so hard to thread that needle to a soft Landing because you have to stay high enough to make sure inflation doesn't come back in a second wave because if you don't and you get an inflation a secondary wave like the 70s you get a hard Landing but if you stay high for too long like let's say they stay at five and a half percent for another six months then you start to run the risk of of a deflationary crash right so that's why everyone sort of rolls their eyes about a soft Landing is because it's so difficult to thread that needle and I don't I do not envy their job I I do not envy their job because it's not and and they're also operating with long and variable lags like how can they know all the effects of prior monetary policy um so yeah it's it's a tough place for them to be and and we are oh sorry Rob go ahead no no go ahead Max I was going to say you know we are seeing some smaller economies in my opinion forecasting when our rate cuts are coming like we have seen the Czech Republic actually start to cut we've seen Poland cut um so it you know historically it's not perfect right but you are starting to see some of these smaller countries actually they they LED through the hik so they began to hike first they paused first and they've actually started to cut so I I do anticipate that you know in similar fashion to what has happened historically we will see the US begin to I guess cut rates hopefully uh later this year um but I do agree with you Ben like if they held rates where they're currently at through you know all of 2024 that would also put some pressure um on our economy and our markets but with that said like I don't know what you you guys think but I mean really the the final you know real dagger or Domino to fall is going to be of course unemployment creeping up above four four and a half percent do you guys think that if they just held rates where they're currently at all through 2024 um but we didn't see the labor market really deteriorate could financial markets hold up in that instance I mean if if the labor market doesn't deteriorate sure I just think that um I mean it seems like the unemployment rate is trending up um and the the problem with with that is that it doesn't tend to move in a linear fashion right it it goes slow and then it starts to accelerate at some point and we haven't reached the acceleration phase right so there's still a chance that we can avoid it but the longer they wait the the the riskier that's going to be I think I think there's a higher probability of a rate cut this summer than the market is giving credit for I don't think it has to happen this summer but I think the right thing to do is to cut at least 25 basis points uh this summer 50 basis points something like that just uh provide something you know are you thinking in the June meeting or July meeting I mean look last cycle I know that that the altcoin market was a lens into the consumer and I know that that when alts broke down against Bitcoin and when eth broke down against Bitcoin the FED basically cut one month later um and we we have seen eth fall against Bitcoin it had a weekly close below the June low we saw madic Bitcoin uh crash below it's June 2022 low we've seen adaa Bitcoin and Dot bit coin we've seen Litecoin Bitcoin and a Bitcoin I mean so many of these altcoins are are falling off their Bitcoin support levels and you can see it with the Bitcoin dominance so I think that the pricing out of all these rate Cuts is going to cause them to get priced in because the FED does not base their decisions on what our altcoins are doing right un they don't care what I what I what I find unfortunate is that a lot of the small like companies like Mom and Pop shops a lot of them are going out of business business right now because you know rates are going up and and and times are getting harder like inflation is so high so people just can't afford as much and but the FED has to do it because all of us Deens in the in the space can't help ourselves from bidding up jpegs you know and and and leading inflation uh to to where it was so I think that it's it's kind of a tough spot to be and the FED has to stay long enough to kind of break the animal spirits but if they do it too long then you then then you run the other issue of of a deflationary um unwind and that's not really fun either I know like people are like oh I'd love to go to the store and not spend as much money but if you if prices go down that's probably not good for risk assets terrible just yeah so everybody everybody who's watching the videos remember this when when you think like okay the Bitcoin Market or the crypto Market has to do this thing it has to do this thing because it's it's been the cycle that's always done this doesn't actually work like what we just talked about just how fragile the markets actually are and just to think how things have to really go in line before you realize that oh maybe I should have taken some profits when there was uh everything was overheated just it's just something to think about because I hate people who roundtrip and uh they really should again take some profits when everything gets too hot and and one thing just to mention about rate cuts and I mean you guys probably know this rate Cuts inherently are not bearish right it's it's the underpinning as to why they are cutting rates and you know if you actually on a granular level you go and you overlay the effective federal funds rate with you know the NASDAQ or S&P 500 markets actually tend to rally for like 30 to 60 days give or take following the First Rate cut until they wake up and they realize oh crap there's economic deterioration under the surface which is why they're cutting rates and then we see these major Corrections so I think whether the first 25 basis point comes in June or the end of July meeting or I guess hopefully September um that's probably your 30 to 60-day warning truthfully whenever it comes and I don't know when it will and what about no go ahead I was going to say you're right I mean like the rate Cuts inherently are are are bullish for risk assets if they're cutting for the right reasons in 2019 while Bitcoin topped out when rate Cuts arrived the S&P 500 kept going up and you know because the mark like the the economy was not in a recession right it wasn't going into a recession they were sort of like preliminary rate Cuts You could argue that Bitcoin is more tied to financial markets today traditional markets today than it was back then because of the spot ETF so maybe it would track the S&P 500 a bit closer than it did last cycle once rate Cuts arrive but the issue is why the FED is cutting are they cutting because they're trying to get ahead of something bad that's coming or are they cutting as a reactionary thing because they just saw a really bad labor market prance and that is is when they're not bullish like that's when rate cuts are be so it all depends on Max is right it all depends on why they're cutting and and I think that it's also risky to I I I do believe that there's just as much risk to the UPS side truthfully where you know assuming that they're going to cut because there is severe economic deterioration can also be you know a very harmful strategy long term because like you mentioned the first batch of rate cuts that we saw in 2019 um you know the S&P 500 rallied out of those cuts like 15% and then of course we had our Co nuke in March which took us below you know where that that first uh cut occurred right but you know again it's like you have to be very careful you kind of threading your own needle per se because just because they're cutting doesn't mean sell everything right because they could cut you know the labor market could be more resilient than anybody's expecting the S&P 500 could go up 50% over the next year and then something bad happens and you get a correction but that correction doesn't take you down to as low as the point in which the first cut happens so you just have to be a little bit careful truthfully you know you have to really understand why they're cutting and and it's a tough thing to do it's very tough I me with the S&P you know there there's been all sorts of like crises throughout all the decades but if you just pull up a chart over a 100 years I mean you know the the the overall trend is clear you know um the markets generally go up because the money supply yeah yeah you know why did prices of houses go up 40% because the supply of money went up 40 per. you know it's not it's not I it's not really that complicated so yeah no I mean I think like as always right like time in the market often beats time the market um because it's impossible to to actually time the market for under most circumstances and I think sometimes people get lucky with it and then assume that they're like a genius and can do it again and again and again um but the reality is that the market will humble us all at some point why don't we go ahead and wrap it up there um we we'll have NFA live back I guess next week next week I think it'll be on Rob's Channel um so we'll see you guys over there next week and again if you're not subscribed uh to to Max or Rob links for their channels are in the description below and uh we will see you guys next time

know the having is is just under a day way um so why not why not do a live stream and and then talk about it trying to post this all right um so let me see if I can pull up a having countdown here's one so 23 hours 2 minutes uh looks like it'll be on April 20th uh just after um the turn of the day right so I mean if you're on eastern time in the states then it'll obviously be on April 19th if you are you know in Europe or something it'll be or Asia it'll be April 20th so I mean it really depends on on where you are uh as opposed to the date so I guess for some of us it'll be on April 19th for other people it'll be on April 20th I tend to just measure all these things by Bitcoin by UTC time you know weekly closes by the UTC time like we're looking at it Eastern right um so I mean I think it you know just saying April 20th is probably um the way to go but I'm sure some people will say April 19th especially because that's where it will happen in the um in the in the states so let's go over to to bitcoin it's currently just below 61k um I don't really have an agenda tonight to be completely honest I just thought hey why not throw in a live stream talk a little B about crypto uh you guys know my thoughts on the market obviously I've made those very clear um you know and I I do think that that gold breaking out and eth Bitcoin breaking down does have ramifications on the market and and if you look at at what has happened to altcoins ever since eth Bitcoin broke down they just can't they can't really catch a bit against Bitcoin and they just keep keep on bleeding right they just keep on bleeding uh bitcoin's kind of staying the same so far but the altcoins kind of just keep on going lower and and this is exactly what we saw just before rate Cuts last cycle as well um and so what you would look for when you do get volatile moves by Bitcoin whether to the upside or the downside it should be fairly detrimental to the altcoin market so if Bitcoin were to you know to Rally back up to the 8we SM then I imagine it would break alts down on their Bitcoin pairs if it were to drop to the bull Mark support band and then bounce or something I imagine it would break all Bitcoin pairs down as well and so that's kind of the you know sort of the The Dilemma that that altcoins find their find themselves in at the moment um but I I also think it's important to remind ourselves that even when you're in larger Trends um there can of course be counter Trend rallies right so you know even though I'm bullish on on bitcoin dominance like I have been for like two and a half years it doesn't mean you're not going to occasionally get pullbacks along the way we did see a pretty big pullback by dominance right after the spot ETF um I'm not really convinced that we have to have a big pullback by Bitcoin dominance after the having but if it does happen just know that the trend is likely still intact uh and it's so far Bitcoin dominance has been doing a really great job of just holding 55% I mean I've actually been pleasantly surprised that it's been able to it and um I I I assume it will continue to go higher as the months um continue to sort of pass Us by but let's go through if you guys have any questions we will um talk about them and Ivan says how are you doing fine at the moment um we got a lot of comments up here yeah 24 hours to go uh no I'm not going to be doing a 24-hour stream dream uh no I I won't be able to do that um I will have uh other duties to attend to I do have four young kids um so I'm not gonna I'm not going to do a 24-hour stream but maybe if I were in college I would have so hopefully there's someone out there uh that's doing the 24hour stream but it's not GNA be me um someone says Emily says hello from Central California uh hello I was actually looking at um uh the YouTube stats recently and I was looking at let me see if I can pull this up analytics audience where is it right here it is okay so here is the let me actually go to Lifetime so if you look at my lifetime and analytics uh based on age and gender you can see that 94.4% are male only 5.5% female um and statistically most of you are between the ages of 25 to 44 so if you're a male between the ages of 25 to 44 then there's you're not alone there's a lot of other other people that are that same demographic as well but it does you know it does really make you wonder like how do you actually get more uh women in crypto right I mean I have to imagine that that one thing that would be helpful would be for all the uh the the Relentless meme coin Shilling if I think that is probably not the way to to reach a lot of a lot of people but um we'll we'll see I have received some messages about that you know I think a lot of people would just prefer like you know not the whole crazy open mouth thumbnails and all that kind of stuff but but something a little bit more um realistic but yeah I mean it's interesting um and and of course most of you are at least I guess the third of Year from the United States and about 9.5 from the UK five and a half from Australia 5.4 from Canada and 4.3% from the uh Netherlands so Netherlands is representing some there um let's go back over to bitcoin we're we're currently around 61k um someone says uh why are we dumping you know I've talked a lot about how you know I mean look guys you there could always be a a bounce after the having or something but you know there is a lot to be said in terms of um you know just kind of being ahead of where we normally are at this point in the cycle and I again I know it's not cool to point that stuff out but know we saw the same thing happened last cycle we got really far ahead and then we we basically spent 9 months cooling off to get back in l so I don't know if that's going to happen again um it probably depends on on you know monetary policy as well but just something to keep in mind right something to just like kind of keep in the back of your head that that could play out and it wouldn't necessarily mean anything um same thing happened last cycle I think that you know when you get into a period where it's essentially up only for a while um any type of move to the downside just seems like unbearable but I mean you can see where we are um at this point in the last two cycles we were still 50 to 60% below the all-time highs so um it's it's not I mean it's not that crazy diminishing returns I do think we'll have diminishing returns again this cycle um you know whether it's a left translated cycle Peak or not uh whether you get a peak in 2025 or 2024 um yeah I mean just depends on on a lot of different things and how how everything uh plays out check markets gold oil pumping hard on the war news um yeah I mean Gold's now at 2400 but I I would say I mean you know there gold has has been building up to this for a long time and and now it's broken out so yeah yes of course we're going to find reasons I mean you know back in 2022 when you had the whole like you know Russia Ukraine situation we saw gold go up and and we that's still ongoing by the way and it still came back down right um so you know I mean you have to think about that too right like that is is something to consider because um yeah I mean like if it if if we were just going down here we'd find a narrative to support it so yes I mean you can we can always say there's a reason for it but there's also been um stuff like that in the past and you know but I think you know we saw gold building up here it made sense for it to break out I've said for a long time it's going to break out and when it does it's a risk-off signal for the cryptoverse and you know that was met with a lot of uh criticism of course but here we are and gold broke out e Bitcoin broke down and the cryptoverse is is stuck in traffic on struggle Street right now uh thanks for all the content knowled J sure um someone says green candle in today April 20th my my guess there's GNA be a lot of volatility tomorrow which probably means we're not going to do anything but if I had to guess I would say there's going to be a lot of volatility tomorrow um as the having I I guess the issue is that really it would be on Saturday if it's UTC time so technically it wouldn't even be tomorrow because you know it' be on Saturday UTC but I I suspect that you know going into the having and just after the having there's going to be a lot of volatility um and you know you could make a case either way um you know you know if you look at the first if you look at other local tops and you kind of see like what happened going into them um and and by the way I mean it could be more significant than just a local top I mean I I don't want to imply that it can't be it it very well could be and I I've said before that it could very well be something like that um but you know in a lot of these times like kind of we've seen the market just sort of slowly bleed back down at these tops you got these rallies back up to the 8we SMA after getting a few week moov to the downside but in 2020 late 2021 we basically just went back down um you know pretty far in fact kind of back down to this level here which is where this base would be and that's that's pretty that's pretty far down so I really don't know I mean I really don't know which way it's going to break but um I I hopefully hopefully you have a plan you know hopefully you have a plan uh to navigate it um my my guess is whatever happens all Bitcoin pairs are going to are going to go down a lot is is what I would suspect over the next couple of months can I talk a little bit about Bitcoin duts um I mean you guys know my my thoughts I'm guessing you're being sarcastic but I I I just suspect it's going to go to 60% this summer that's my view I just think 60% is likely going to happen this summer and and I I just hope people are prepared for it um I I feel like I've done the best I can to try to prepare people I think too like at this point I've either sold you on the idea or I haven't and so it almost seems like like kind of useless to make you know keep making one hour long dominance videos it's like you either buy it or you don't right you either buy the idea or you don't and at this point you know with it being at 55% 55 and a half percent and already went to 57% you know I I do think it could top out right in the 60s not too far from here and so you have to be I have to be careful because I don't want everyone to you know finally believe it R when it actually finally hits the top I mean I this is why I've been bullish on dominance since 38% um I do think you know a good part of the move is behind us for dominance but I I still think there's a little bit more to go in it so yeah I mean we'll see we'll see what happens um in the next couple of weeks for Bitcoin uh whether it gets the move back to the 8-week estimate or not again example here where you go back up to it example here um in 2019 where where you go back up to it you above it right above it in those two cases and then an example here where you you went back up to it but it it took it a little bit longer right I mean like you know we we had a little bit of pullback and then the third candle here which is the one we're currently in was a pretty big move to the downside where it actually you know went down to that Wick right there right it went down pretty far so you know whatever happens my guess is sometime in May um you you know you or maybe June but you would get back up and it could even be like the next couple of weeks if it if it resolves like this right here but even that could still end up being May um that you go back up to the8 week but again you know if it if you get a larger move down first that move back up to the 8 week might not be as impressive because in the eight-week estimate would have come down quite a bit yeah I I know I'm not really looking at the news but I I don't really talk about the news on here but um yeah I don't know I mean I I will leave the news to you guys what's a good question to ask I don't know someone says once the Bitcoin race becomes the space race of the sah alts will a blip in the history in the history books I do think that like you can make money on alts because there is alt season like once every four years or so but I I think it is true that most alts will just bleed back to bitcoin over the longer Hall and so you are better off just kind of if you are in the altcoin market occasionally taking profits back to bitcoin just so you lock those profits in um if you're if bitcoin's sort of your unit of account right so you know if you don't really want to use the US dollar as your unit of account and you just want to treat one Bitcoin as one Bitcoin and say I don't really care what USD valuation is worth because even if it goes down it'll probably recover eventually then yeah I mean like I I I do think it makes sense to to value your portfolio in SATs and not US Dollars and I know like when you're going through your first cycle that seems insane right I mean like it seems insane but by your second cycle and your third cycle you really start to understand like why you you value your portfolio and Satoshi over over you know US dollars because it's all about preserving the Satoshi valuation of your portfolio and a lot of those all just go to zero um again like some of them won't I mean some of them will will likely you know survive obviously I think ethereum Will Will Survive but you really have to be careful I mean you do and I I know like people are like well whatever but you know you find yourself again where a lot of the alts are are not even really that far off of I mean they're just putting in new lows against Bitcoin right I mean a lot of these alts are putting in new lows against Bitcoin and so um there really wasn't a great time to be in that altcoin over the last three years right I mean like look at eth Bitcoin it's been in a downtrend since December of 2021 right I mean there hasn't really been a great period to buy eth over Bitcoin and hold it for a year you know I mean or for a couple years maybe if you cherry pick this low here you could find an instance but I mean for the most part it's just been bleeding um the same goes with with a lot of with a lot of all coins so you have to be I mean you certainly have to be careful with them someone says hello from Singapore can you talk about alt season in 2017 and monetary policy at the time well in 2017 the FED had been raising rates for a little while but the main difference is that rates were relatively low right so it's not like it was a super aggressive rate hiking cycle like we've seen this time um I mean a lot of these bull markets are basically just the market kind of like adjusting to higher interest rates and seeing if it can handle it and when it does the market goes higher and then eventually it can't and then and then the market caves but yeah I mean you had an altseason um you know over here I mean rates were really low they were only like one and a half percent so technically they were going up but they weren't really that High I mean you know the cost of capital was still relatively cheap and so that's why I mean I I I don't think it it it was as bad but once you got you know to to one and a half 2% then you can see what what ultimately happened to the crypto Market it's more like the rate of change I think than anything else this is a pretty big rate of change but um please talk about a scenario where the FED doesn't cut rates until 2025 so I do think they will cut to be clear but the market is saying only one cut in 2024 and then one cut all the way out till April of 2025 that's what the market thinks right now my suspicion as I've said is that the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in um because once and the reason if you think about it like why that would be the case if you if you see rate Cuts get priced out then businesses are starting to actually going to believe that the FED means what they say and they're going to go higher for longer if businesses believe it then they're going to change their spending you know they the type of spending they're going to cut costs they're going to lay people off right if they just think that rate cuts are just not really ever going to come anytime soon and so just the market believing that rate cuts are not coming will probably cause them to to actually come quicker um on a day like today obviously a lot of people think there's only going to be one cut this year I suspect you could get multiple Cuts this year and I think it's possible to get a cut this summer you know um so yeah I do think that it is possible even though I know the market is not really calling for a cut until um September at the current time someone says hello from Tasmania wow they going from uh California do I think salana will overtake eth uh no I don't um if you look at the sole eth valuation I mean it it it sort of looks like it's you know at the top of the range here right if it's an oscillator um so so these are these are sort of natural questions that come up about altcoins when they've rallied against eth or Bitcoin for a while is you know do you think you're going to overtake them a lot of times those questions come up at range highs right so um just the fact that you're asking that you know and I know I know I've looked at the soulle E valuation for a while here um but you have to be careful with that sort of stuff because a lot of people will think that especially when you're near the range Heights and then and then it just ends up being no different than than before someone says TLT spiked um yeah so so so bonds are a way to hedge uh certainly if you if you want to be um if you want to hedge it is in fact dubious speculation can I talk about plan B's prediction um yeah I mean I I really don't think bitcoin's going to go to 300K um I I do think eventually it will but I don't I don't think it's going to go there this cycle um I mean we we we basically had the same disagreement last cycle too I mean like I I was um more conservative he was more optimistic um but with that said you know I I also would argue that he's had a lot of great predictions a lot of things have worked out so just because I don't agree with it doesn't mean it's not going to happen I just think that you're you're you're probably not going to go to 300K that would be basically like a 5x from Peak to Peak and last cycle we only did like a three you know a three and a half X from Peak to Peak so I just I I don't think you're going to see that happen this cycle but I do think it is I think it's attainable in future Cycles um but I I don't think it's going to happen this cycle someone says they're female I got into crypto because I wanted to learn about it now as compared to when I made you with diena no I think it's great to learn about I mean I think it's great to learn about oh we got someone from Brazil someone says I think that women are by Nature more risk averse yeah I feel like a lot of times yeah like the um you'll see more guys take on a lot more risk and and you know like sometimes it works and then sometimes it really doesn't work trying to find more questions but you guys are all just saying the same thing you're talking about geopolitical stuff which I don't really want to get into um and I think the issue is that you know we always find a reason you know we always find a reason but um I mean remember I mean like eth eth saw a top before the merge a month before the merge and the reason why I've said before that we have to be careful with this one was because it was a month before the having and also um you know this FIB retracement kind of shows that would be an area that would be potentially difficult to get through and it it is proving difficult to get through right and if you look at this you know we're sort of falling below the below the 3618 the 2618 is all the way down to like 47k right I mean that that would actually be below the bull market support band um so if you were to go there it would basically be sort of a crash below the 20we SMA um I I don't know if that's going to happen or not I mean I I do suspect that Bitcoin will go below the 20we ese this year but I don't know if it's going to happen like immediately or if it's going to be like a 2019 style thing where we chop around for a few months and then go below it someone says diminished interest it's really interesting because think about this guys we are a day away from the having and the social risk is 0.1 no one cares like like no one cares and that's why I I think we're more similar to this phase before rate Cuts than we are to sort of this uptrend over here where we're putting in higher lows the social risk just put in a lower low which is more similar to what we saw back over here in kind of the 2019 phase so I think that is ultimately where we are right now in the cycle is just before those rate Cuts arrive and and people are losing interest not because they don't like crypto but it's just that they're struggling right they're struggling with uh with with with finances maybe they're worried about their job you know inflation is brutal and this is why if you look at prior Market Cycles with you know traditional markets this is why inflationary periods are just so brutal in the markets because because you know the consumer struggles with all these higher prices for everything they have less disposable income but you know I kind of just think we're in this phase right here where social interest is just really really low um and could stay that way I mean honestly it could stay that way for you know the rest of the year frankly at least through the summer but yeah I wouldn't be surprised to see it the social risk you know stay in the in this lower area for a few months maybe bounce back and forth a little bit but um I wouldn't be surprised to see that but you're right I mean the social interest is is really has really Fallen um even though the having is only one day away if you look at YouTube views for a lot of these different crypto YouTube channels um you know they were basically at two million just a month ago month and a half ago and now they're down to one million across all these different crypto YouTube channels so definitely a lot of interest has been lost in the crypto verus recently which again is why as social interest goes down Bitcoin dominance goes up right we've talked about that a lot um and you can see it right I mean here's Bitcoin dominance without Stables as social interest goes down Bitcoin dominance goes up because if if you need if you want to see altseason you need a lot of new retail investors coming into the space to frankly buy your bags right but if they're not coming into the space and there's just not a lot of interest then the altcoin market keeps on bleeding against Bitcoin when Bitcoin dominance tops out what do you chart your alts against I think it still makes sense to chart them against Bitcoin if you want to chart them against eth as well I think that makes sense I wouldn't Char them against really anything else uh not like you know not Ono I mean I think Bitcoin and E make the most amount of sense if you want to compare altcoin valuations to other altcoin valuations you can do that but I I don't think it's as relevant gold running at this particular time versus Bitcoin is undeniably about look I I think it really is what we saw like last cycle it's you know gold broke out and and when it breaks out risk assets falter was the same thing you know it's the same it's legitimately the same thing we saw last cycle and I just feel like so many people don't want to believe it because of the having but what about the merge with eth I mean everyone told me after the merge eth Bitcoin was going to go up and look it it has only gone down as we said it was likely going to do um you have to be careful you have to be careful with the narratives it's more so what are the charts saying and what the charts are saying is that gold is broken out and that eth Bitcoin is broken down and I said for years that when e Bitcoin breaks down that's when the cryptoverse will struggle because it will represent a source of liquidity drying up right and now now that you got your first weekly close below the the the range low there you can kind of see just how how much the altcoin market has struggled on their on their Bitcoin pairs someone says the Head and Shoulder Target on gold as likely is 2500 I don't know anything think about the uh the whole inverse head and should I've said before I think we should leave The Head and Shoulder stuff to shampoo companies but I think that you know 2500 is is definitely a realistic Target I wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback from there but it's one of those things where like you know you spend three years waiting for it to break out and then it breaks out and then everyone's waiting for the pullback and you just don't get one right so I I do think if there is a pullback by gold then it probably would just be a um you know an opportunity do you think it's going to go higher for several years like it's not you know when gold breaks out it doesn't just break out um and then in the move immediately it usually breaks out and and has a a pretty impressive move that that lasts for a while so my guess this is going to last for a while um you can still get pullbacks like this like happened after it broke out in 2008 um where it broke out and then it actually had a pretty massive pullback but even in that situation it was a lot quicker to recover than you know than than risk ass that's it was a hedge right it's a hedge someone says when is a good time to accumulate alts um I I I I I mean look it's up to you it's really up to you I I don't think alts Mak sense because I just think dominance of bitcoin's going to go up you know so if you want exposure to crypto I think you're better off with Bitcoin uh with that said Bitcoin risk is still relatively high right now um as I mentioned I try to be as transparent as possible uh with with Bitcoin and what I'm doing um maybe not as possible because I mean I do Focus some of that on ITC premium but if you look at the risk levels you know as you go up the risk levels I I think the idea is as I've said to dynamically DCA out because you never really know um where the Top's going to be the local top you don't know if you're going to go to the highest risk band or if you're going to top out somewhere in between so by taking some profits along the way it it tends to work out um that way you know you take some off the table in case the market nukes uh but you still have some in case you know in case the market keeps going up so far we've seen a lot of like 20 to 22% Corrections over the last year and a half or so so far this is about 18 and a half percent so a 20% correction would put it around 59k a 22% correction we put around 57k so that would be an important level to watch the reaction from because if it reacts like it normally does from that level then you would expect at least some type of relief if you don't get a reaction from that level then it might mean the market is changing remember remember it was actually when all Bitcoin pairs broke down and E Bitcoin broke down over here that Bitcoin finally got a larger correction um right now while eth Bitcoin broke down alt Bitcoin pairs haven't broken down but they can also break down very quickly we saw how much they Wicked in just a single day not too long ago so I mean you know you could find yourself tomorrow where all Bitcoin pairs are are below 04 um so it certainly is possible and I I really do hope my my my goal my focus has been to help people realize that alts are incredibly risky and and and you know Bitcoin exposure can give you exposure to the upside but if if Bitcoin drops 30 40% the altcoin market gets annihilated um and if the altcoin market doesn't get annihilated it's only because Bitcoin went up right so if you just I mean bitcoin's kind of gives you that exposure um I also think having some cash can make some sense here as I've noted especially if you dynamically DCA sold in the point 7 a point8 wristband um but you know you know I'm not asking you to like go sell everything or anything like that I just think that you know you want to make sure you manage your risk um you want to make sure you're preserving the Satoshi valuation of your portfolio and the way that you do that is by not being needy in the altcoin market when you're on the verge of rate Cuts because when the verge of rate Cuts happened last cycle we saw after eth Bitcoin broke down I put about a tweet about this and I did a whole video on it right I said last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down the altcoin market dropped like 70% now maybe this time is different but I'm just telling you that was my experience last cycle right my experience last cycle was eth Bitcoin broke down and then alts basically just slowly bled for like nine months six to nine months right if you exclude the pandemic six months right it was brutal right it was just brutal because it was like there was no end in sight it felt like it was never going to end um I mean you can see a lot of these alts are are are you know just sort of slowly leading back to bitcoin so that was kind of the sort of the purpose of all these dominance videos to help people recognize that that Bitcoin uh does provide relative safety over altcoins um and that even you know if Bitcoin were to get a big drop from here it's still well off the lows whereas the altcoin market really isn't that far off the lows you know I mean like it's really not you know in fact most of them didn't even put in new all-time highs even salana which rallied a lot didn't put in new all-time highs card is nowhere close xrp do I mean a lot of these coins are nowhere close to their all-time high so if Bitcoin gets a correction where do you think the altcoin goes right I mean it potentially goes to a lower low that's what happened last cycle I know people just blame it on on everything but we always find an excuse every cycle for why it happened um and so I I think that just kind of sticking you know with a certain strategy for me it's just been Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio and then have some cash and fixed income accounts earning interest and then use that to navigate crypto right so if you get dips you can use um you know if you get big drops back to below 04 risk or whatever your risk tolerance is my risk tolerance is 04 but if you get big drops to your risk levels that you're comfortable buying at then you have some cash you have some cash flow to take advantage of that uh but you also have Bitcoin to give you exposure to the upside I mean even even here bitcoin's up 4X off the lows how did I get the conviction for your calls in the face of haters I I think it was I mean with with with all it was just like I've seen it before like I I remember last cycle dcing altcoins like from Q3 of the bare Market year through the H through the early part of the having year and then most altcoins put in new lows in the having year and I was just like hell I could have just stuck with Bitcoin that whole time and been so much better better off you know so I was like next cycle I'm going to do it differently after the top is in I'm just going to preach the good talk about Bitcoin dominance and get people to realize that altcoins are really you know alt season only comes after we go back to you know a lot looser monetary policy and QE right that's when alt season comes back and ALT season comes back when the haters give up right that's when it comes back know you can you call It All season all you want to I don't really care what you call it but you know as far as I'm concerned you know look at the chart you know show me where alt season was over the last three years you know and in the Bitcoin dominance St show me where all season was I don't see it I mean is this is this your all season right I mean is that is that your All Season no these are all seasons right that's what you're looking for we're not there right we're not there the only way you get to all season is for dominance to go higher first right and then once it's higher and all the Deens give up then you get all season but as long as the Deens don't give up guess what they keep on spending you know like crazy and inflation is still an issue and the FED has to go higher for longer right once you break the animal spirits inflation finally comes back down the FED pivots and then Bitcoin dominance goes down but I just I don't think we're there yet right I don't I I think that Bitcoin dominance is going to go to 60% where is the 8we I think it's at like 67 um but I mean it's going to move down quickly because the the price is going down quickly so I mean like you know it's at like 66.8k right now but you know I mean because that the price of Bitcoin has moved down so much in a very short period of time you will see it sort of roll over in the coming weeks and start to back down unless we go right back up someone says they need a Bitcoin only portfolio tracker you know there there's a lot of the portfolio trackers if you look will have a little button that you can click that'll convert it from usdt or USD to to bitcoin right so there are a lot of trackers that do that you just have to maybe hit the toggle the button that has your USD valuation of your portfolio if you click it um some of them have the option to view it on on your Bitcoin valuation and some even have it so you can view it as your eth valuation um so maybe maybe the portfolio tracker that you use already has that feature and you're just not aware of it because plenty of them have the feature if you're using one that doesn't have the feature then uh I don't know what that portfolio tracker is doing but they need to start implementing it after the having what is the narrative I think the narrative after the having is just win rate Cuts is I think that's the H I think that's the narrative it's just the market screaming at the FED to give us rate Cuts is is what I would guess the next narrative is going to be fed said no maybe no rate Heights until 2025 yeah again I I I think the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in so because because the consumer gives up the you know the the businesses give up I think them saying that and the market finally believ leing higher for longer means that it's started it's it's probably time to start fading higher for longer I've been a big proponent of higher for longer forever you know I was in 2022 I said we're likely going to go five and a half percent for the terminal rate and most people were saying we weren't going to go past three and a half percent but now that we're at five and a half percent and we've been here for you know nine months or so remember the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and we're already beyond that I think that in the same way the market underestimated how High the terminal rate was going to be I think they're underestimating the number of rate Cuts we're going to get over the next year they're currently only pricing in two rate Cuts over the next year that's an issue right that's an issue and you can see what's happening markets are are rolling over and it's not just crypto you know you can see a lot of uh a lot of um equities rolling over too so you know I think it's a problem when all these rate cuts a lot of these rate Cuts get priced out and it's because they're getting priced out which my guess in not too long from now we're going to see a lot of them get priced back in so I would fade this honestly I would fade this I mean it could mean a lot of different things it could mean locking in you know certain uh fixed income type stuff it could mean getting some Hedges as I've said before like gold and and and and bonds um but I mean you know with with things like bonds I mean they can still go down if if um if we keep getting in you know hot inflation prints it's not like they have to have bottomed already it's possible they have but it's not it's not like they have to um and and also my guess is that this summer if Bitcoin dominance is at 60% I I think a lot of people will start to call for it to go much higher but if if we're getting rate Cuts uh this summer then you know might not go much higher after that right I mean what would be the that would be the perfect narrative for people to say oh well you know you're never gonna have an allseason again because of of um you know everything's just going to go into the spot ETF but I I do think what we first 60% then we talk that's kind of where I am 60% dominance then we talk someone says that's a nice white T-shirt uh this is the uh the dubious speculation t-shirt we have them in the store stored out into the cryptoverse decom I have no clue in hell why you would buy one uh but if you need a shirt you can go buy one is the cryptoverse still on discount yeah just for the next day after the having we're going to raise the prices of ITC premium so you can lock in the price between now and then if you want lower price they're going to go up quite a bit if e Bitcoin continues to fall into June as you predict well you didn't start buying alts or stay Bitcoin heavy until Qi so here's the issue with it is that alt Bitcoin pairs bottom before alt USD pairs if you have a problem with that statement look at what happened last cycle okay alt Bitcoin pairs bottom before alt USD pairs so in order to figure out when all USD pairs bottom first all all Bitcoin pairs generally have to bottom now that doesn't mean that all altcoins have to put in new lows but you know in terms of building off of a low that can then start durly outperforming Bitcoin first all Bitcoin pairs bottom then alt USD pairs bottom so I think after all Bitcoin pairs find their low then you have to wait a while after that for all USD pairs to find their low um so you know I don't you know if you convert Bitcoin to altcoins you know when Bitcoin dominance tops you might be preserving the satos valuation of your portfolio if Bitcoin dominance is topping out but then the issue could be that your USD valuation of your portfolio is going down because while all Bitcoin pairs might be going up they might be going down on their USD pairs because bitcoin's going down right so the altcoin market is really a slave to bitcoin during this phase of the cycle and that's why I've said forever right just have Bitcoin if you want exposure to crypto because you know I mean you know if Bitcoin goes up it's going to go up more than Al and if it goes down it's going to go down less than alts generally speaking some are going to break that rule but generally speaking um and as far as eth I I've said before I do think it's going to fall back through this wedge because that's exactly what it did last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down right we had this wedge and and it fell back through it as eth Bitcoin broke down and we just saw eth Bitcoin break down last week and it seems to me like you know it's falling it's potentially falling through this wedge right you can see right here it fell through the wedge after eth Bitcoin broke down here and then eth Bitcoin just broke down and it looks like ethusd is falling back through back to that wedge which is around 2200 or so um but you know my guess is that is that eus will you know will go go there this summer is my guess I mean if not sooner but I I do think that if you just look at last cycle I know everyone wants to compare this year to other having years but I'm telling you monetary policy plays a role and if you didn't believe me last year you should believe me this year because Bitcoin dominance kept going up you know most of the people that refuted the idea of monetary policy playing a big role thought the Bitcoin dominance had topped out they should go back to the drawing board now that Bitcoin dominance put in a higher high right it means they were wrong it means they were wrong so I I think it it makes sense to compare it to mon you know use monetary policy to guide the view of the uh of the cryptoverse someone says the S&P futures are under 5,000 um yeah looks like you're right it looks like we are at a that's a pretty big drop this week 40 uh 4970 how will Bitcoin cycle correspond to the S&P cycle if it is left translated um I mean I imagine if Bitcoin cycle is left translated then it probably means that the S&P is also uh topping out sooner as well um there's also a scenario where the tops already in I mean it's not necessarily you know something that I'm saying has to be the base case I think there's you know compelling reason to believe that if if the FED pivots later this year and they start printing again then we could go back up in 2025 but if they don't if they really don't cut rates until 2025 like you know one of the one of one of them said uh then you know there does exist that scenario that you have to that you have to consider right I mean you know I mean we've seen we've seen markets find local tops in election years in in in March of 2000 actually uh the S&P found a local top or a macro top for a while and um in the 70s it was in December and then in in the first in the first big inflationary cycle and then in the 1940s the uh the election near top occurred in the summer so there's a lot of different periods of high inflation um where the markets are just Manic and and inflation is running rampant where you do see some tops in in election years but also note that there is actually seasonal weakness in the S&P 500 around this time in election years right so it's not even it's not even clearcut uh if you were to look at say you know the S&P 500 um and you compare say 2024 with the average of election years I mean you can kind of see that it's actually still well above the average of where it normally is in election years right so I mean there's there's some seasonality you can see here a lot of times the S&P kind of goes below its yearly open on the average as you get out into the May time frame um or you know may to June time frame so that's pretty standard um I mean you can see just how more volatile this one has been than sort of the average if you look at 2020 obviously that was a crazy one to compare to um and I'm not asking you to you know put a lot of faith in that one but you know you can look at 2016 and see that this is this one is currently outperforming that one you can look at 2012 actually 2012 at this point was actually doing better than this year has been but you can also see that this is kind of the phase where it it it you know sort of fell back down until maybe like May June time frame uh you can look at 2008 obviously 2008 wasn't really a great year uh 2004 here's 2000 and so on and so forth do I think the Bitcoin having will slowly Drive price up I think we are really far ahead of schedule this cycle and I think we really need the market to cool off I think that would actually be really healthy if it could if it doesn't if if all the animal spirits continue to run wild then we probably um you know then you get a blowoff top that is you know uh left translated and can be really bad for the longer term um I I hope I hope the market cools off uh if like kind of like last cycle where all Bitcoin pairs have an opportunity to bottom out um but I just I don't I don't think they bottomed out yet I do think all Bitcoin pairs are going to go down do you think the Bitcoin will hit the middle or high into of the logiic aggression rainbow chart well we've already gone down two and a half log lines right I mean we already done it um so we've kind of already hit it I think we could hit it again maybe later the cycle kind of like we hit it a couple times last cycle but the two and a half log line rule has already been hit here can I explain what Bitcoin dominance is basically it's just the uh the you know the the market share of Bitcoin with respect to the entire asset class right so like if Bitcoin dominance is at 50% it means that bitcoin's market cap is half of the total market cap of the entire asset space of the entire asset class what all coins do I I haven't been buying alts I mean I I've said for a long time I I think uh you know Bitcoin makes more sense at this phase of the cycle if rate Cuts does Bitcoin go up or down it depends on why rate Cuts if you look at history there's examples where rate Cuts cause Asset Risk assets to go up and examples where risk assets go down and it's because it's why they're cutting if they're cutting to kind of get a head of any potential bad stuff then risk assets can go up in 2019 while Bitcoin went up when they cut rates um or sorry Bitcoin went down when they cut rates the S&P went up um but there are times in history where the S&P goes down when they cut rates if they're cutting rates because they get some type of really bad labor market print or something then they cut rates for the wrong you know because they waited too long and then the market goes down so it depends on why they cut there's not like a an answer that that is going to be fitting for you it's not like I can just unilaterally say that risk assets do X or Y when rate Cuts arrive it really depends on the specific situation because you can find examples of both if e Bitcoin falls into lower regression ban then ALS will fall um yeah someone says greetings from Mexico City someone from Brazil too if eth Bitcoin pair plays out as you were saying well all season come at all or it'll be a very shortlived all cycle so if it plays out like last cycle right which is a big F but if it does it means that the alt season that you're wanting is not coming this year if that if it plays out like last cycle if it doesn't play out like last cycle then maybe all maybe the alt season does come this year but if it plays out like last cycle where once rate Cuts arrive the market bleeds for like six to n months then it it means that um the market gets really boring you know and and then in 2025 maybe when everyone's given up then you get alt season um but yeah I mean I I I think it's possible that you still get alt season in terms of like Bitcoin dominance crashing but I don't think Bitcoin dominance is going to crash until you get until you see it at least at 60% and even then it's probably gota kind of move around you know from 60 to 61 or to 58 right it's got to bounce around for some months there before you see it come back down anyways oh I got someone from Africa how many to reach 800,000 subscribers that's a good question um let me go check I'm at 799,000 1857 subscribers so if 143 of you could hit that subscribe button I will be at 800,000 subscribers I would very much appreciate it uh if you could subscribe if you're not already Subs got someone from Argentina um so glad you finally can to out of Al in 2023 I was a late yeah no I mean look some alts did okay it's not like all alts have been terrible but most of them have just bled to bitcoin right and you know I think that the the the collapse of eth Bitcoin is a really bad element for the altcoin market and I know it's easy to make fun of me for it and say you know you don't know what you're talking about but it's just what happened last cycle I I don't have to be right about it I could be wrong but it's just sort of a fair warning last cycle when e Bitcoin broke alts dropped 70% right that's what happened I didn't control it right that's just what happened um so I don't know like I don't know if they're going to do the same thing but I'm not putting my money I'm not risking my money on alts if you know during during during a do during a Bitcoin dominance rally uh you're free to risk your money on alts if you want to but I'm not going to risk my money on them um I've also missed out on some pretty cool gains in the altcoin market that's a fact too you know there's definitely some altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin um let's be real right I'm not trying to pretend like you know you know it was the perfect idea not to have any alls but I mean I'm just saying for me real relatively risk averse if you see a Bitcoin dominance rally coming from a mile away which is what I thought I saw and I was right like why would I go put a lot of money in alts if I just think Bitcoin dominance is going to go up right um just ride that Bitcoin dominance wave you know let the altcoin market bleed to bitcoin and then your purchasing power to buy Alt with Bitcoin goes up right even if Bitcoin goes back down like think about it like think about it like this today let's go maybe this is a great a good way to explain it so today if you look at one over eth Bitcoin one Bitcoin will get you about 21 eth right in in MA in in um December 2021 when Bitcoin got you about 11 e right if you had if you bought Bitcoin at the top in 2021 and R and rode through the highs and the lows the your USD valuation is essentially the same but guess what you can now buy twice as much eth with the Bitcoin that you have that's why Bitcoin dominance matters is because you took on less risk to hold a safer asset Bitcoin and now you can buy an altcoin for a lot cheaper and if Bitcoin were to go down to 50K or 40K even you know even if it goes lower right 30k in 2019 it first went to the 100 we SMA when rate Cuts arrived right I mean so I mean if it if it does that it could it could take a long time for us to get there but that's where it ultimately went you know I mean it went to the 100 we moving average um right now that 100 we SMA it happens to actually correspond to that breakout point right I mean it's kind of uh coincidental but that's actually what it corresponds to so you know if you get a situation where Bitcoin crashes Bitcoin dominance likely still goes up and so then like you might be upset that your Bitcoin USD valuation is down but then maybe your Bitcoin will then fetch you 30 e right you see what I'm saying it it really depend it comes back to whether you believe in the future of the cryptoverse right if you believe in the future your of the cryptoverse then you know for satoshi's sake value your portfolio in satoshi's if you don't believe in the future of the cryptoverse then fine value your portfolio in USD but don't come crying to me if your altcoin bleeds 90% against Bitcoin over the next 10 years or probably more the satos evaluation is what is important and you know it is you can laugh we but it is that that is what matters is sat valuation it shows you just how easy it is and it's not just you know look at look at Ada Bitcoin you know look at look at one over Ada Bitcoin in 2021 one Bitcoin would get you about 15,000 Ada today it gets you 141,000 Ada all you had to do was stick with Bitcoin once the FED made it clear they were going to be raising rates and going to quantitative tightening you didn't have to have any clue where the USD valuation is going to go by the way none of us have a clue you didn't have to have any clue where the USD valuation of Bitcoin is going to go all you had to say was look we're going into a high interest trade environment the fed's going to be reducing the size of their balance sheet Bitcoin is a safer asset there's going to be a hell of a lot of Regulation risk coming for the altcoin market so I'm just going to ride that Bitcoin dominance wave convert all to bitcoin and wait until the FED pivots that's all you had to do and then one Bitcoin over here got you 16 you know 14,000 or sorry 16,000 Ada today it gets you 141,000 Ada and I don't know I mean I don't know which alt coins are going to become relics but guess what if you held Ada all the way down then you're sure as hell invested and you hope it goes back to a new alltime high if you just converted your altcoins to Bitcoin in early 2022 when I said was the time to do it you have the luxury to just kind of come in at some point in the future and just kind of scoop up whatever altcoins you want at much cheaper Bitcoin valuations right that's why I say don't marry an altcoin right don't marry an altcoin there's only one year of the cycle where it really makes sense to to to to be heavier really heavy into alts there's really like one year of the cycle where that that makes sense you you spend one year Watching Bitcoin dominance go down and then then you spend like three years watching it go up right it's not that complicated guys it's really not in fact look at this chart if this chart I was looking at this earlier it should convince you well maybe not it's dubious but look at this chart six-month East Bitcoin candle right look at this and tell me tell me everyone on here is not just over complicating the Everlasting you know what out of it green red green red red red green red green red red red you know I mean what's so hard about that right this is what happened last cycle I don't know why people thought this time was different it's possible that eth Bitcoin Bottoms in Q2 or Q3 I said before it might bottom in June that's kind of like my base case right now is that it Bottoms in June but that's going to be predicated on the idea that the FED pivots this summer If the Fed doesn't pivot this summer I think they're making a bad a really bad mistake honestly and you know I do think there's a good chance we get a hard Landing but if they don't pivot this summer I I think a hard Landing is probably locked in um because the the consumer is is starting to falter here um just because you have some residual inflation based on lagging data uh it doesn't mean I mean it doesn't mean that the consumer is healthy right but I mean look at that look at the E Bitcoin six-month candles red green red or green red green red red red same thing green red green red red red I mean it's the same exact thing for anyone who cared to look at the damn chart you know but instead I spent the last two and a half years listening to the eth Maxis tell me how it was holding up well every step of the way down and now some of them are starting to capitulate and I'm telling you I'm telling you some of them I think are going to be capitulating into that 0.3 to 0.4 range and that could be the bottom right when they say all right Ben you were right like all right well now that you believe me it's time to go back the other way so you have to you have to be careful with this stuff it's playing out like like it played out last cycle for anyone who actually cares to look at the chart and and and they don't come on here here and tell me that you know I'm ignoring all these higher lows on the E Bitcoin pair because I'm not you know I'm not I I recognize there's higher lows on here but you know what else I recognize I recognize lower highs you know so don't don't just look at at at one of the charts look at all of them right I mean you can see that like however you want to draw this out there e Bitcoin is breaking down you know um and you have to be careful when that stuff happens and I mean you know I think it I think it's going to accelerate the breakdown into the summer months and then hopefully bottom out this summer just like it did on the similar time frame in the last cycle when you looked at those six-month candles someone says chain link early M last cycle the issue with chain link you know I I with the Bitcoin valuation look to see what it does here you know I drew this potentially out um a while back you know when it was back up here look to see if it holds here at um at 17700 STS that prior low sort of that back testing that that trend line if it can hold there then maybe you have something right if it can't then you're just it's a falling knife right see if it holds support I don't know if it's going to hold support a lot of these Els aren't holding support like Ada Bitcoin sure is H holding support dot Bitcoin I mean what is there to say right Litecoin Bitcoin as I said before what it does best is bleed against Bitcoin or Litecoin bleeds against it link Bitcoin just said madic Bitcoin I I think I think there's a good chance that madic Bitcoin will will bottom before eth Bitcoin um so if you see madic Bitcoin bottoming then it might mean eth is gonna bottom against Bitcoin but I don't there's not really a clear evidence yet that it's bottomed um I've said forever that once madic gets below a thousand stats you got to be on the lookout for it and it's already gone below a thousand so as it continues to bleed here look to see if it can form a low right that doesn't mean the USD valuation is done bleeding even when the madic Bitcoin low is in the madic USD valuation can go down after madic Bitcoin bottoms same thing for eth Bitcoin and ethusd and Ada Bitcoin and Ada USD and Bitcoin and USD right it's the same thing but either way I mean look you have two scenarios here right I mean the markets don't tend to go sideways for very long so it's either going to go up or it's going to go down my contention my contention is that if it goes up all Bitcoin Get Wrecked if it goes down all Bitcoin pairs Get Wrecked so Bitcoin dominance goes up no matter what right so that's why I've said you know rinse your hands of the altcoin market until lose for monetary policy AR that's been my view um admittedly whenever I whenever I get super vocal about it uh you know inevitably someone does it and then and then we get a bounce and they hate me for three months but um it's been my V for two and a half years you know if if it took you until now to to get on board with dominance train that's not my fault what's my long-term stance on E Bitcoin I don't really know I'd like to see if it can bottom at 03 to 04 someone says interesting that dominance isn't spiking as hard as a few days ago as when we hit 60k there's an interesting dominance chart and that's like dominance excluding Stables um and it's actually kind of doing what it did LA I mean it it it did something similar last cycle where it sort of swept the high and then cooled off for a little bit and then kept moving up I think it's going to move up it might it might cool off for a week or two but I I do think you know in May and June you should see the dominance a lot higher um especially you know especially as we get further out into the summer right like May June maybe even out to July I don't know I think the hard part is the dominance rally has taken a lot longer than I thought it was going to so I don't really want to limit it to May or June like it could rally until August or September for all I know um but I mean it it it really depends on on just how quickly it it takes things to you know to to to play out you know and I I don't know um if if if for instance right I mean like like like let's suppose if e Bitcoin bounces after the having like it bounced after the spot ETF right you see after the spot ETF e Bitcoin got a bounce if it gets another bounce then I mean it essentially delays everything by like a month or two you know um so it kind of depends like I don't know if it's going to get that bounce after after the having um you can see that last cycle we we did get sort of a similar type of Bounce but eth Bitcoin hadn't actually broken the range lows on a weekly close whereas here it already has so you know I don't know you got s your one two three um one two three you can kind of see it's already breaking so I don't know if it's going to get that bounce at all anyways and the last time it didn't get a bounce um it didn't get that final bounce right it just broke through so there's definitely like evidence to suggest that it could go it could get a bounce but my base case is that is that um e Bitcoin bleeds you know my base case is I don't I'm not going to bother trying to predict every single low or high by the E Bitcoin pair I'm just going to say look I think it's going to go down if it goes up in a twoe time frame or something so what that doesn't change anything for me it doesn't move the needle um just like all these other lower highs didn't move the needle for me someone says you all expect a balance from 58 I don't know where did it go um how low did it go I mean it just went to 59 six um so I mean that so what is that what is that measured from the top so that's about a 19 so we've now gone 19% down a lot of those pullbacks before were about 20 to 22% so it's getting pretty close to that typical pullback if it's more than a 22% drop if it's like a 25 or 30% drop then you could still get a sizable rally off of that like 2019 but it it probably is even more definitive evidence that the local top is in right because that's what happened in 2019 is after e Bitcoin broke down um you finally had a 30% drop as opposed to just like a 10 to 15% drop um so if you get a larger drop then it you could still get a balance off of that level but it probably is kind of some evidence that whatever comes after is a lower high if you bounce it 20 to 22% down there's still a chance right there's still a chance that you know you could see another move up but even in that case you still have to watch that 8we moving average because that 8we SMA is is potentially we're potentially going to get a weekly close below it um and we've we've I mean I shouldn't have to explain why that's important we've talked about it for the last year uh but you know when that happens it can certainly mean the market is cooling off and and you can see that it really cooled off over here last summer as well as it went below the eight-week moving average same thing in 2021 both Peaks same thing in 2019 right once you get that Weekly close below the eight-week estima it doesn't mean you can't get another face ripping rally back up to a lower high but it does tend to mean that the party's going to be over um for at least a little while for someone who has a higher risk tolerance you think D saying Al now a bad play I think it makes sense to do what you're comfortable with I mean like I I don't think that like what I'm doing makes sense for everyone um I think it kind of depends on where you are in your own Journey you know I mean if you want to take on more risk who am I to tell you not to do it you know I mean there's been plenty of people that took on risk and made a lot of money so I I think you have to remember like what's right for me is not what's right for you do I see Bitcoin hitting higher highs before a summer slump um that's a good question I don't really know I mean you know with the spot ETF we you know the market wasn't really looking that great and then it it just spiked up and put in a new high right so like you know and then and then it and then it real you know radically sold off after it now of course we ended up going up a lot higher but um it it's really hard to say I mean I think that we're probably going to get to the point where you know everyone's gonna think at least that it's going to go to a new High um especially if you get some type of like rally like that off back up above the 8we estim like we saw in 2019 and 2021 I don't know I mean I I do think there is a case to be made the closer you get to May and stuff that um you're GNA see that summer lle come into play I'm not going to say it can't go put in a new High I mean I mean look at the wick into the spot ETF right look at that Wick right I mean if we replicate that then you know it's essentially a new high but I mean it's risky right it's risky to sort of bet stuff on that again I don't I don't base my investment strategy on whether I think Bitcoin is going to Wick back up to the highs or not like that's not something that I even care about um I don't really know I mean I I do think there there is some reasons to think that with eth Bitcoin breaking down and gold breaking out that it could turn into into something more but um that something more could still be one or two months away right where it you know like over here it after it fell below the 8 week and then still rallied back up for a few weeks and then it fell um in 2019 after it fell below the 8 week you know it still it still rallied back up for a few weeks and then it it still and then it finally fell it took a while right I mean it took a while and and you might get something like that right where it just takes a while if it plays out like late 2021 that would probably be the most brutal way uh to you know to potentially put in a local top is to just not even really get a relief rally and just kind of go straight back down um right after the Bitcoin having that would probably the most brutal way if that happens look to see what happens to all coin pairs under such an environment you can see that Bitcoin is is going down today it's down about three and a half% and dominance is up right I mean this is what I we've talked about forever right you know you get into the phase of the cycle where Bitcoin goes down and Bitcoin dominance goes up Jessica ask is it having the 19th or the 20th it depends on where you live um you know in the uh in the states it looks like it's going to be the 19th but if you're in Europe or something you know like UTC time you can see it's potentially going to be the 20th so if like you're in Europe or Asia or something it's going to be the 19th if you're in the states it's going to be the uh or sorry if you're in Europe or Asia it's going to be the 20th if you're in the states uh it's going to be or you know just on North America South America right it's going to be um uh April April 19th so it depends on where you live again guys make sure you subscribe if you're not subscribed uh we have I'm trying to get to 800,000 subscribers so it would in fact be nice to get there if you would not mind subscribing we actually just gained some so we are now at 799,000 so I just need 96 more people um so yeah um if you could subscribe that'd be great and also we do have the sale on ITC premium links in the description below that's going to end after the having so just fair warning um any other things should we wrap it up What If the Fed raises rates this year I don't really think they're going to raise rates I mean if they do I think that would be a really bad mistake I I don't think they're going too um but yeah if they raise rates it probably just makes Bitcoin dominance go even higher you know frankly um I don't think they're going to raise rates but yeah that's what it would mean could a rising alt pair on its total three valuation or could alt total three pairs on dayl an indication of future strength yeah if you if you're seeing an altcoin kind of like outperforming most other altcoins then it's probably an indication of future strength there's a good chance it is not necessarily but I mean like not set in stone but like I've seen that happen a lot of times where if an altcoin is showing relative strength in a dump then whenever you know whatever there's the next relief rally then it can it can outperform a lot of other alts in a in a pump huh how do I keep my ego in check after being right for so long guys the reality is that I have I mean I haven't been right about everything there's been so many things I get wrong and that's how I keep my ego in check is because the markets humble everyone um you know yes some some things I've been right about but also a lot of things I've been wrong about and and you know when you get things wrong it humbles you and um and the market humbles us all someone says they unsubbed and subbed again just for me I I appreciate that looking back should fed of raise rates a few I don't think so I think they're doing what they need to do I don't know if I'm going to go live in 20 hours I don't know I don't know I do think there's going to be a lot of volatility though I think it's going to be uh kind of crazy it might not be tomorrow because technically UTC time it's the it'll be the next day but you're probably going to see a lot of volatility going into the having so just be aware of that um yeah what does the extension from the 20we look like it's kind of funny I uh I put out a video about it um and it ended up doing the same thing that it always does and everyone over complicated it once again um which is kind of fascinating right it really is fascinating how like every single time it just does the same thing it always does you know um and every time no one wants to believe it right again the trend this trend line will eventually Break um because otherwise it just implies that Bitcoin will only ever go below its 20 week SMA and never get back above it um if it if you carry it out far enough So eventually this trend line will break but it hasn't broken yet and um I mean I do think it will break but not yet it hasn't broken yet is it just a coincidence that ta allines with macros current War scare I I think we find reasons for things um I think we we like to blame we like to like rationalize why things are happening that's my guess because like if imagine this like imagine if you had this like War thing you know like the whatever you know the current scare going on right now and if the markets were up 10% then everyone would just say oh they're up because it means that it means that we're going to start printing money to fight the war you know but if we're down then people are like oh it's down because you know everyone's scared because of the war right I mean whatever happen s you can find a narrative to to support that view right so like if tomorrow the price is up then people will say oh price is up on fears that the war is happening therefore the money you know people are the the central banks are going to start printing again um if the markets are down it'll just be markets tumble on you know worries about tensions across seats you know so I mean it it it it really does feel like we look for the reason to explain the price but really price leads the narrative The Narrative doesn't lead the price whatever the price does we'll figure out the narrative to go along with it um not the other way around um also the other thing too is once you hear about the news it's already been priced in because you know I know we all think we're special but you know there's there's going to be other people that get the news before we do and algorithms that can you know price that stuff in way before we can so by the time you see it it's already been priced in theoretically you know it's not like it's not like you're going to go read the news on some news outlet and then be able to like get an edge generally speaking right because if if you're reading it on a news Outlet then s have millions of other people so what Edge would you have actually after some of the last tensions and didn't we get a bounce where we swept the high in um in 2022 I think we did I mean it wasn't like we didn't sweep the the actual top but we swept that local high I think um because the uh Iran invaded Ukraine like right here right and you had a a long Wick down and and then the market rallied back up and it actually swept the highs so yeah I mean like it's certainly possible that something like that could happen I I'm not going to say it can't happen um I mean I don't know if this is exactly the same pattern or not yeah like if you take this and you just sort of overlay it to this one right I mean you can kind of see that the market ch around in this range and then It ultimately it kind of looks like it's deviating some though because it was like following it it bounced up it was following it and then and then the market rallied but then this time the market has kept going down but maybe because it's the whole retaliation stuff that hadn't been priced in yet um but I mean you can see that it it did go back up sweep the high right it swept the high and then it got a a a big pullback so imagine how hard that would be for Market participants if you go up and and you sweep the high and then you drop into the summer right and that's why I think it makes sense to just have a strategy either way I mean like try not to stress so much about it um just have a strategy and and and I I wouldn't like try to over complicate it I mean because you also might not get that I mean you might not see that same type of move and it could also be dependent on other things I mean like you know if if in May the unemployment rate comes in at 4% or something then you know maybe the markets go down right because they're like oh crap the labor market sucks now um but if you get a Lower Print at like 3.7 or something then maybe the market rallies back um and people use that as the reason someone says they're 90% down on their mcoins back I am sad to hear that uh if you're if you're telling the truth and hopefully you can maybe stay away from the mcoin market and focus on other things someone says if you're chasing new Cycles you will always lose I would agree with that I I think that yeah like the news isn't going to give you an edge on in the markets oh did I say Iran I meant um I me Russia yeah I'm thinking about the uh the current conflict and and and um and the and the one that's you know happened that sort of kicked off in 2022 so yeah I meant I meant um me Russia see I don't know we'll see we'll see if it uh what happens here if it sweeps the low and then if it if it moves back up up into the having or or what is the bmark support B8 WEA valid for total market cap chart I I imagine it would be something similar um I think it would be something similar so the 8we for total Market is at 2.43 trillion so for us to get a rally back up there it would from this level it would be about a 12% rally to get back up to the 8we estimate for total Market am I up to dat on the candidates tournament yeah there's a tie for first place with like what two games to go all right guys I think we're going to wrap it up uh thank you guys for tuning in again subscribe if you're not subscribed uh we are still looks like we're at 79,90 so I need

      "Hi, this is NFA live this should be a relatively exciting show for two reasons first of all we have the Bitcoin having coming up in just about a day and we also have a new guest with us today Max from because Bitcoin uh how you doing great thanks so much for having me Ben yeah and you started you started doing this a year or two ago is that right yeah probably about 18 months ago officially yep all right yeah so max is um I've known him basically since probably before he even started the YouTube channel or right around the time that he started it uh so make sure you guys go subscribe to him and Rob as well uh links to that are in the description below so make sure you guys check that out and we're just going to go through a lot of the different questions that I think would probably be on people's minds as we go into the having uh so let's just go ahead and jump in Rob we'll start with you on this one the having is tomorrow it's tomorrow we've been waiting forever here it is fourth having um and I'm guessing it's going to garnish some attention should be making some headlines different places I'm curious what what effects do you think the having will have on the larger crypto space um do you think it'll bring new eyes to the scene or are we still kind of just uh you know the same old same old people just kind of hanging out um do you think it'll it'll actually bring new new people to the space uh we saw a lot of new people come to the space last cycle sometime after the having um or do you think it'll be quiet for a while and do you see any narrative shifts after the Havoc that's a pretty loaded question first of all I would just like to say that Max has a great background I'm sure he got to the same place I did which is fivr and uh hopefully he didn't get ripped off but it looks great and uh I gotta tell you one of these days max we're gonna have to put that into an nft just me and you so yeah yes that is my old green screen but I'll be jumping in that green screen as soon as the uh as the Bitcoin hits 100K But to answer Ben's question which I think is is what uh everybody wants to really try to figure out is this Bitcoin having and I know like there's a lot of first of all that I still believe in the fouryear cycle some people say that it doesn't really register I still and some people will talk like Bob Lucas will say well it's just left translated and we're going to see a big blowoff top in 2024 which could very well happen but I still think that the narrative around it and there's still a lot of people say well there's Mass adoption coming and it's already here I still think it's I mean I don't think that we're at the same level like we should be and what we could be in like 2028 or 2032 or you know time comes up but Ben if you get to show my my screen real quick because everyone wants to know like well the Bitcoin having and you did a great I I watched your your video Ben about uh uh the ethereum evaluation ethereum ethereum valuation of Bitcoin about how you know Bitcoin dominance is going up and how it's wreaking havoc and it's true it is right now I know people will will also talk about you know like hey well you know these things happen leading up to the having but if we take a look back this is from Smart Valor it's a good website and if we take a look they did all the work for him which is great this is how Bitcoin behav in the year leading up to each having because we had one of course in 2012 2016 then 2020 and I know people will say well there's always a dip there's always this massive dip before the having and there could be I mean we saw one pretty massive one in 2020 but of course there's a reason for that and and we could either say like it's because of the of the almighty Corona virus or it was something else but yeah there was a dip in 2016 but again just take a look at this so with having with the having one in 2012 the year leading up to the having it went up to 385 per. and the year after of course because we always see alltime highs the year after so far it went up 5,000% having two in 2016 leading up to it 142% now there's dips along the way and we're seeing that right now but then a year after that in 2017 2 84% in 2020 even though there was a turbulent year like we talked about it was still up 17% for the year getting into that having in May I think it was May 12 2020 and then it went up almost five almost 600% the year after that and we can see here that that yeah same thing happened the year leading up to to the having on November 208th 2012 this is what Bitcoin was 250 and then of course we come up and then you can see right here that yes there is a a drop before that and then it comes up and there's a drop before but it's like the same thing as like a bull market so we're seeing the same thing kind of Replay I know it's a funny thing because like Ben you'll say like uh you say hey I I I told you that the Bitcoin ethereum evaluation was going to start to start to lose momentum or actually bleed away to ethereum and then people were going to blame a Black Swan event and they never would have saw it coming but here we are and again same thing happens here 2015 a year going into it yes it's not a straight line but we kind of I mean really rallied into it there's you know dips along the way but I mean it's going in that right direction and then of course 2019 to 2020 we started at 7325 we had it kind of flat and then we saw the almighty Corona virus right here but then we rallied into it so I still feel like the same thing's gonna Happ happen that's just how I see things and I'm I'm feeling pretty good about this having so far but the big question is and and we we'll talk about this later is what's the macro is there going to be quantitative easing or more quantitative Tiding are they actually going to cut rates are we going to have the liquidity that we absolutely need which we had beforehand even though we're in quantitative uh tightening right now I mean we still rallied pretty well but can we get that liquidity back in the market and that's I think that's the big question on top of the fact of are we going to see World War II so yeah that's where I got yeah it's interesting because you know at some point you would think we would need to make the shift from quantitative tightening to quantity to quantitative easing but what needs to trigger that shift is the is the is the thing that I I think we're kind of wrestling with um someone asked where a guy was I I should have mentioned that he's he's in Dubai and I mean there's obviously a lot of stuff going on right there going on right now there with the conference and um everything so he wasn't able to make it this week um so um Max I I'll put the same question to you I mean like what are your thoughts here on the Bitcoin having um is this just kind of the same old thing that we've seen before and everyone's trying to over complicate it uh do you see any kind of shifts coming after after the having what are your thoughts yeah I I would agree with the with the last part I think that a majority of people and it's very easy to do this I I tend to do it all the time is to sort of chronically over complicate something that has for over a decade now been a pretty reliable uh we'll just we'll call it a risk on event and in the simplest of terms all you need to do is you know pull up your trading view chart and Mark out every single Bitcoin having right you need at this point you know you need to draw four vertical lines whenever a Bitcoin having has occurred look at the the price action that has basically come almost immediately following so um you know I I try to look at this thing from Every Which angle you know I look at it from the side I look at it up side down I you know I try to include the macro and and fed policy in all of my decisionmaking but um you know the truth of the matter is this is a very unique time to be in the markets right Bitcoin is now on the global stage in my opinion for the first time um there is you know new on-ramps into crypto you know specifically being these you know nine ETFs um and it is you know there's more regulatory Clarity the accounting standards have shift did in a positive light and are working to you know become more friendly for corporations and big money to actually onboard into this digital commodity if they choose to do so um but again like Rob had mentioned and Ben like you commented on there also are some macro headwinds which can only be ignored for so long unfortunately I am of the belief that we do still have some time I believe we're maybe on borrowed time some people probably don't like to hear that but but I do believe that there is this this unique pocket of time where it's all coming together and we can really see risk perform um positively of course I don't have to tell you guys this and I probably don't have to tell the audience this but historically during a Fed pause until something has quote unquote kind of broken and we see Unemployment uh you know trending above 4% and the FED actually has to step in and begin easing through you know interest rate cuts and other measures um we can actually see risk you know being stocks and now crypto performed tremendously well and you know going back to you know to the last cycle you know we actually kind of went through a little mini fed cycle here and you know 2018 2019 and 2020 um you know where Bitcoin actually the floor kind of gave out we dropped to about 3K and then we had that famous rally into June of 2019 when we topped um you know there was actually hikes going into that and then of course right as Bitcoin basically topped in June of 2019 the FED began to actually cut rates um more or less right after that and it did dramatically affect Bitcoin some will say you know it was a reflexivity and you know we had to you know we we sprung hard off of that local floor so you know of course the market corrects to the downside some will say it's covid some will say it was in the charts the whole time some will say it's not I don't know you know nobody knows whether it would have happened with Co or or without um but again I don't think that this time really is that much different I think that every cycle has some distinct differences from from a previous one I mean for example last cycle we had a double top we haven't had a true double top before we have had a cycle like the 2013 one where we had you know two pronounced Peaks but a true double top had never happened before and additionally in the bare Market we had never spent as much time below the 200 WEA as we just did coming out of this most recent bear so there are you know of course Very recognizable and notable differences of every cycle but you to answer the question Point Blank I don't think that this time is much different and I I'm trying my best to not overthink it um and say you know what there is no reason for the FED to intervene at this point we're trending in that direction and we are on borrowed time there is a Day of Reckoning coming but I do believe at the earliest it's probably sometime in Q4 we have the having you know in less than two days and I do believe that there's plenty of room for risk to run in the short to Middle term maybe going out six months okay yeah no I mean it's great to get you guys opinions um and the market has been on an absolute tear I mean essentially after since October right I mean it was pretty boring summer last year but then since October uh the market has basically just been up only up until the last few weeks but um you know the next thing I'd like to talk about is of course Rob's absolutely favorite topic and it's of course Bitcoin dominance um and you know I you know you guys know My Views but I always like to get other other views because you know I'm I it's it's a good idea not to live in an echo chamber so Bitcoin dominance has once again broken a new highs I I we saw 57% actually it came really really quickly really quickly you know that that move to 57% it's kind of cooled off back you know it's back down to like the 55 like 55 and a half or so so it has cooled off quite a bit since that rally up to 57% uh so uh Max I'll start with you first on this one do you think it's going to keep going up after the having um you know it was it it was going up into the spot ETF and then it kind of waned a little bit following the spot ETF but then it just kind of picked right back up so what do you think is gonna happen this time and and this kind of goes to the whole like the last question as well like will there be a narrative shift and what people are focused on will they will they start focusing on more things besides you know sticking with Bitcoin um do you see you know what are your thoughts on that Max well first I have to give you a compliment Ben because you were one of the few people that with a big following publicly called Bitcoin dominance rallying to this point I didn't expect it to get up to I think it topped at what 57 recently or wherever did you you deserve a lot of credit for that well I'm known for riding Trends too long see well we'll see right nobody knows besides the market right like you know we we all have our our inclinations but uh you deserve a lot of credit because I remember months and months AG I don't it was probably six months ago plus we did a space together or you came on on my my channel because Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance was significantly lower and eth BTC was significantly higher and much has changed since then so kudos to you where do I think it goes from here so I think that Bitcoin dominance is in the process of we'll call it distribution okay I believe believe that the meat of the move is over um but that does not preclude it from going a little bit higher than here maybe maybe 60% that's not my base case but you know let's let's look left on the chart and you know use that to you know maybe forecast what could happen next so ignoring the you know whether this is a left translated cycle or an expedited cycle let's look at it contextually for where Bitcoin is at um you know from from a a p perspective right so Bitcoin actually has gone on to get above the previous cycle all-time high of 69k so most comparably again ignoring everything else but just pure levels on the chart pure you know where was the cycle High where was the cycle low you could probably compare Bitcoin right now to like December of 2020 okay if we just ignore everything else and say okay Bitcoin in December of 2020 went on to sweep the previous cycle all-time high of 197 it paused there for what maybe a month or or something like that it was chopping around altcoins got destroyed during that time right Bitcoin uncertainty like you always preach Ben uh when Bitcoin is uncertain alts get absolutely eviscerated and we are seeing that once again right so um again comparing this period of time to December of 2020 there is turbulence under the previous cycle all-time high which is not uncommon we saw that again last cycle and then also two cycles ago it seems to be sort of the same thing happening again what did we see in December of 2020 well what we saw was Bitcoin dominance basically put in a deviation or bull trap High where on when Bitcoin finally decided it was time to push through with conviction above the previous cycle all-time high of 197 you saw Bitcoin dominance put in an explosive move which ultimately ended up being sort of a bull trap you know for for the Bitcoin Maxis um so I I think it's possible we are seeing that Devi that deviation high right now only time will tell um I do have hedges in place you know like I'm I'm holding some Bitcoin l2s like STX and some Bitcoin ordinals and things like that that I think would be beneficiaries of you know Bitcoin dominance continued rally maybe above 60% um but of course you know I I really I am of the belief that contextually with Bitcoin chopping under the previous cycle all-time high seeing similar signs of Bitcoin dominance putting in you know this this last explosive push I do believe that over the next six months or so it would probably makes sense to see Bitcoin dominance Trend down dramatically and additionally and and I don't mean to you know bring this up because I don't know if this is on the agenda today exactly I imagine that that would translate to eth BTC finding a bottom sooner rather than later but that doesn't again preclude it from going down a little bit more and only time will tell yeah no I mean it's great and I mean I I I think it's always worthwhile to hear these other views because um you know no one really knows right I mean you know no one really knows and you know one thing that I've wrestled with a lot before and I've seen other people do this too is like you know just because someone gets something right doesn't mean they're going to be right they're going to keep being right right and also just because someone gets something wrong doesn't mean they're GNA be keep being wrong I mean you know markets change no one knows what's going to happen and I I I could see eth Bitcoin carving out a bottom this summer um that's kind of my base case I could see that actually happening so we'll see if that happens Rob what are your thoughts I mean I know you're you're more of a you're more of a Bitcoin Maxi yourself right Bitcoin dominance to 100% I yes exactly go ahead Ben what was your question I'm just kidding I'm just kidding what what are your thoughts here on on on dominance do you think it's uh you think we're getting pretty close to the uh to the top well first of all let me just say that I I I was like listening to to Max especially on like the Twitter spaces and things like that he's very smooth in his delivery and very smart and and what he talks about so I gotta tell you it's good to hear like different sets of opinions it's great to have a Max here so to talk about I mean Bitcoin dominance I got to tell you like when you were talking the 60% I'm like yeah you know I can kind of see it you know I was I was I was under the assumption like well you know it always kind of comes back that way right something happens there's something that happens in the market a Black Swan event or you know something that's just that kind of has disruption and then people get scared and they're they're like okay I'm risk on but not that risk on to go into like you know Pepe coin I'm gonna go into the safest asset in the most volatile industry which would be Bitcoin and I I could see that for sure but then like there's a narrative that that people are always talking about especially in in in the crypto space being the Bitcoin maxos are going to say Bitcoin only right but there are narratives that are out there one of those is dpin Right centralized physical infrastructure Network the other one are dexes because we see what's going on with the centralized exchanges getting sued getting their pants sued off by the SEC and then leaving of course so we have to have dexes and then of course there's another big one which is web 3 so we talk about that but there's one that I feel is on an undertone and Max alluded to it when he was talking about it when he talked about runes and he talked about ordinals and he talked about things like stacks and l2s and I think what's gonna really push Bitcoin dominance up I know Ben loves this part too is uh the the l2s or even l1s that are going to be built on bitcoin Ben if you just throw this this chart up I always talk about this website it's l2. watch so imagine this and I and and and even like Adam back has talked about this how he's talked about he hates the fact that everybody's building off of Bitcoin people should just build on bitcoin because he says it's like it's it's like the tcpip layer for for the internet so why can't they just build on the most the safest most secured Network or computerized Network ever built in the entire world and he was right so when I take a look at these these l2s that are coming out and they're all new so you I to understand like this some most of these are trash let's just let's just call it SP Spade but like when we talk about things that are coming out that are actually doing pretty good like a Stax who's been around for quite some time I can really see things actually happening for sure and then like I just dropped a a video on my second Channel where I talked about core core is a top uh 50 well it's 56 now but it's essentially an L1 L2 type of uh uh token which is built right on top of Bitcoin using delegated proof of work and delegated proof of stake together to actually make dexes nfts and a whole host of things you can only do with smart contracts so when I see stuff like this happening I'm like why can't we take away the nonsense that's going on over in ethereum world and they're massive gas fees like just like with with core and stacks right now if you use it or the things that are being built on top of it they're just going through their Satoshi initiative it's super cheap and it's super fast so for me to see that Bitcoin dominance could go up why couldn't it especially with the different institutions that are here and how they've been drilled into it now they can say oh there's something else I can do and also smart I see it could actually go above 60% but again I'm not always right no I mean I I've it's possible it's certainly possible um I think the answer is going to probably come in the next few weeks because you know there's two prior examples where we had these kind of these like closes below the 8we ese 2021 and 2019 and in 2021 after it happened Bitcoin got a rally eth Bitcoin went up but in 2019 when Bitcoin got that rally eth Bitcoin went down so I think if we see Bitcoin get some type of relief I don't know maybe sometime after the having into may I I don't know exactly when it would be but whenever that comes whatever happens to eth bitcoin should be very telling about where we are in the cycle so I I'm going to be focused a lot on that um over the next few weeks but we will see um next question Rob I'm GNA start with you on this one to rotate and you know I remember last year you saying something like this um and and you ended up being correct it was basically you know sell and man go away um like I mean no one's D Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear since October I mean you know I mean it was basically like 25 to 30k not even that long ago um and I I think sometimes we forget just how quickly it has moved so I'm curious like do you think it's going to be similar to last summer where we just get the market gets boring before maybe moving up again like later in the year or something you think it's just going to get boring for a few months um do you think or on the other hand do you think everyone's gonna get think it's boring and then we just get another you know face what's it called like a face melting Rally or something that's exactly face yeah I mean like so so what are your thoughts going into the summer because I mean again I know last summer you you thought it was going to be boring do you think it's going to be boring again this summer or you think it's going to be different Matt well first of all I I hope so I I really do because everybody who's in the chat right now answer a question for me uh tell me if you think that you've accumulated enough where you're like you know what I've bought plenty of Bitcoin and I just cannot handle any more bags I just I don't want to buy anymore especially if it goes down and gets cheaper just let me know in the comment section because it seems like when these types of things Ben when you say things are boring this is great because this is when people who like the dollar cost average is fantastic or if you're Dynamic DCA is things go down which I think where we at the risk levels now 0.6 0.59 somewhere around there a little yeah I think a little above 0 six so like if we're in this place we're like well I mean for me this is a good time to just accumulate a little bit but as we start to like if it goes sideways well great I have more time to bring things in but then if you if you want to talk about selling May and go away there's this great chart on this website that I steal from constantly and if you just take a look because it's it's yeah it's a nice website it's very nice I think there's a sale going on until like tomorrow and then it goes away so but if if you say sell in May and go away it it actually works out pretty well I mean historically speaking but then if you really want to break it down because people say but Rob you don't get it because this is the having year so it's all it doesn't really it count well if you take a look at it I mean if you sold at the end of May of 2020 I mean you had a 30% increase on January a couple of drops there 34 and 10% and then you're down here and you just kind of stay away until October and then you buy in and then October rallies November rallies and December rallies that's not bad I mean I'll take that year right and if we go back to 2016 I mean it's the same type of thing if I want to sell in May okay well June's gonna go up but I have red red I take I stay away September as well and I I buy back in October November December I'm doing pretty good so I still think it can work out all right the thing that you have to understand though and one more thing is is this there's a presidential election I think this is going to be pretty tumultuous as we get into it so there was this piece from hbk's wealth and it talked about the presidential election years versus the non-election as far as returns and this is just taking a look at the S&P 500 you can see that in the presidential election years which this is that year it sends to like kind of peek off around March April and then just kind of fall away until we get into junisha may go away October is here you buy back in and then we have a nice little rally of course drop here and then off we go but 10% for that year is not too bad now does that mean that I'm going to sell everything no no I'm just telling you these are just the data points that we can say take a look at me personally I'm just here to accumulate and uh get into some early round type of cryptos that could either make a lot of money or go to zero one of those two will always happen yeah I was looking at this um this is uh this is the S&P 500 in 2024 compared to the average of all election years right I mean so you can see like it has come down a lot recently but it also went up a lot too like way more than it does on average so there's just been a lot more volatility this cycle than I think we've seen in a lot of Prior Cycles um but yeah I I thought that was interesting and that chart sort of reminded me of that uh Max what are your thoughts here I mean I know earlier you said you expected uh risk to do pretty well um over the next six months but you know even with that do you think that the market could cool off before that phase or do you think it's not going to really get much of a breather or do you think the Breather is almost over yeah that's it's a it's a great question of course we're all from relatively familiar with the uh maybe cliche but overused but also kind of accurate saying of sell and may go away um one thing that I've been preaching for a while going back to I mean even I would say Q4 of last year is that I was seeing signs early on of a maybe expedited cycle for crypto um and it's probably off of of you know the back of this this fed paw and there isn't quite as much in my opinion economic deterioration as a lot had thought myself included and we're in this you know kind of Goldilocks window where risk can rally really unencumbered um you know so so do I think that selling may go away will come to fruition I I would think that worst case in my opinion from what I'm seeing right now and again of course subject to change it's just one man on the internet's opinion I think that similarly to how this cycle for crypto is being a little bit front Rand and we've actually seen for the first time a Bitcoin all-time high before a having which of course had never happened before um I also think it's possible that selling may go away is being front ran a little bit and we're seeing that right now with this April correction so similarly to Rob I am not I am not in the camp of you know drisking or selling spot because again like I mentioned in you know during our first question here if you just draw four vertical lines on your trading View and Mark out every Bitcoin having look what typically happens in the six to nine months following Additionally you know for a lot of us that have been slowly you know and thoroughly meticulously dcing into our digital digital assets and our unregistered Securities over the past year you know a lot of us have tax consequences for selling right now and I'm I'm not really interested in incurring any uh you know tax consequences trying to reposition because May perhaps is a little bit choppy so in my opinion you know and again going back you know the past 18 months for Bitcoin we haven't seen more than a 22% correction on bitcoin so from our local high recently take it down 22 to 25% maybe you get 57 56 worst case that's not enough for me to incur you know a taxable event to try to reposition so uh maybe it happens maybe it doesn't but for me ultimately it doesn't make a big difference because the having is in a couple days um and typically what happens after a having is months and months of prosperity and hopefully price discovery yeah no it's a fair point I mean I think like all the corrections that we've had by Bitcoin for the entire bull market have only been about 20 to 22% yeah we've already seen it go down about what 18% or so um so that I think that'll be the the area I mean if we get down there see if it turns around and if it does maybe the time's not different you know but yeah what do you think Ben do you think selling May and go away will come to ahead um I think now I mean so I so we went into the 7 to point8 risb in March so that I think was the time to to drisk some kind of like during the spot ETF um at this point it's kind of like when we went back to 39K after the spot ETF um we then it was it was a 22% drop and then we just rallied after it right and and so I was like you know this could be our preh having year dip and then the rally just continued and so now it's kind of the same thing it's like you know the the area to do it if you were convinced about it would have been in in March you know um when gold broke out because that's actually in 2019 when Bitcoin topped was when gold broke out um so I think that would have been the time to do it now I do think there is a risk of if you've waited if you've waited till this point and now bitcoin's down 20% we did see both in after the 20209 or the 2019 top and the 2021 top the first weekly close bow of the 8we SMA we then had a rally back up you know to the we right which is around 67k we actually went slightly above it in both cases so I think what what's more important is not exactly what happens here at the range lows but it's what happens whenever we get a relief move does it sustain or does it just put in a lower high I think that is kind of the thing to look for because back in after the spot ETF it wasn't a lower high we just you know had another face ripping rally fire um the the reason why I am more cautious on this one than than the last one is because eth Bitcoin has now broken down and gold is broken out which both of those events marked the 2019 local top and it wasn't the market cycle top and this kind of goes back to what Rob was saying you know there is this idea of a left translated peak in 2024 and I can sort of like I'm like 30% maybe 40% aware of that like you know thinking hey this is this could actually happen you know if if we were to Rally into the summer to higher prices without cooling off then I would be very more so convinced of a left translated Peak but what if what if if you think about what happened after the 2019 top after gold broke out and after e Bitcoin broke down Bitcoin went into a six to n month bare Market in fact now imagine you get that after the having and everyone thinks the cycle is over by the end of 2024 because it just hasn't done anything since the having and then we just get another move in 2025 and then the cycle Peaks when it always does and once again everyone over complicated it you know like there is a chance that that that happens um so I would I think I would just watch to see what happens whenever we get any type of relief does it form into a lower high or does it lead to a higher high and then you probably have your answer to whether it's a left translit cycle or not at that point I can see absolutely yeah and again even in 2019 it was it was just a local top we bled for a while we actually bled back to the 100 we SMA um and then and then we started to go back back up and then we had the we had the pandemic crash but if you ignore that it was just sort of a bleed after all Bitcoin pairs broke down and then and then once we got that back you know we start to go back up those are my and and by the way I mean you've always said this going back when you know before I started my business and I was watching all of your videos you know years ago Ben you used to always say something kind of along the lines of you know the longer it takes you know the higher will ultimately go something along those lines and you know I think a uh this idea of a prolonged sort of midcycle Correction freaks a lot of people out because everybody wants to be rich overnight myself included right of course i' I'd love for us to just go straight up in a straight line and I hope that we do but ultimately I don't think it would be a death sentence for Bitcoin to kind of reestablish value between 55 and 75k for even a full quarter um you know I think ultimately would probably lead to more constructive uh price action to the upside in the long run but people you know their patients will be tested no question yeah yeah I mean I think the the the thing to look for in the cycle I think is is the Bitcoin dominance I I really do think it's the key for the cryptoverse and I think I think that dominance will Top before Bitcoin Falls below the 20we SMA that's my guess is that it's going to top before Bitcoin Falls below it and I think between now and then Bitcoin gets occasional rallies that just take off Bitcoin pairs even lower is my guess um so that's why I just say like you know if you want exposure to crypto Bitcoin I mean you know Bitcoin is is a relatively safe bet if you want to take on more risk there's obviously the altcoin market there's the full DJ mcoin Market um but you have to be careful with those and I I I think the winning strategy with the altcoin market and and even if you are in the riskier memec coin stuff is just to remember like in five years that Meme coin is probably not going to exist No One's Gonna care about it because they're going to be worried about the next stage of mean points right so the way the way to navigate it is it's okay to have exposure to various parts if you want to take more risk but just occasionally convert it back to bitcoin if you make a lot of money right because at least you know you then know hey Bitcoin is still going to be around in 10 years I don't know if this random meme coin is Ben how could you say that how dare you my a meme coins oh my I think I've converted most of my audience to bitcoin Maxis at this point but I will say by the time I convince the last person to be a Bitcoin Maxi that's when the dominance tops out and we go back the other way I don't think we're that far away I think maybe this summer dominance tops out we'll see though but you are correct like what anybody out there like if we're being completely honest Would You Bet Your Life that Your Meme coin or your altcoin is going to be around in 50 years would You Bet Your Life on it I probably would not would I bet my life I mean it's an extreme example right would I bet my life or something valuable that Bitcoin will be around bet your would you bet all your money on it or something right that's much more friendly right so and I would for Bitcoin I have a high degree of confidence and that's why your strategy ultimately it's conservative you know relative to a lot of other people that you know talk about crypto publicly but it is ultimately a long-term winning strategy and people need to recognize that profits from altcoins ultimately do have to flow back into Bitcoin that is the sustainable strategy for sure yeah I mean I think Rob I think Rob was talking about this what last week on NFA live we were talking about like what do you do when you get an airdrop and I think what was your strategy like just 50% you take profits on it right away 50% back to bitcoin or USD and then you let there oh no no it was you let let it go up 2X or something or if it goes up 2x then you sell 50% was that what you said yeah I I call it well two things I call it the half and half method so you get into meme coins or something crazy and then let's say you put it you know 100 bucks in and then it goes $200 so then you sell half immediately and you put the other hundred bucks let it ride because that's house money then when it doubles or triples or or quadruples then you take half again or you take two or three or 4X what do you want to do and then you let the ride and you do that until there's no more riding and it just goes away and then you're like well okay I I did 8X but it went to zero so I don't feel so bad because a lot of people just let it go all the way up and all the way down but if you just play with house money there's a reason why like like I I can see people in the in the chats going well this sucks because you know now we're gonna sideways and you know this isn't what I want to be there's a reason why all three of us are pretty much just like on all of our videos on all of our Twitter spaces we're pretty much the same person whether it goes massively up or way way down me's a little bit of excitement but it's because we der risked enough to like well if this happens then we do this if this happens we do that and I think that's where people should would want to be as opposed to just going okay I sold my kidney I hope this memec coin goes up it's one of those things have a plan no matter what and then enjoy your life don't stress about it right I mean have a plan like you know if Bitcoin goes to 50K or even lower so what have a plan if it goes up have a plan I mean it I I think you know I used to navigate crypto without without thinking about like what do I do if this happens I only would navigate it based on one particular outcome I never hedge myself but once I started hedging My Views then it makes things easier you know you're like all right well this is what I think but if I'm wrong I don't want to be you know completely left out of whatever that next trend is um and when I when I get air drops um well I don't I don't really get air drops anymore because I'm not really that active in in the space but when I did when I used to get air drops my strategy was immediately convert half of it to bitcoin at least half to bitcoin and then let whatever else ride because like half the time they would just go to zero anyways um so at least you get some of that value out in inss um why don't we goe and move on because we do have two more questions and then I'd also like to get to audience questions at the end if you post your question now I probably won't see it so maybe wait like 10 minutes and then post it um this is an interesting question and I to be completely honest most people aren't going to care but gold is is one of these things where like it doesn't do anything for like 10 years you know and like if you think about this entire bitcoin's like like it's entire history essentially since 2009 gold has essentially gone nowhere in that in that entire phase but we just saw gold break to new all-time highs and it seems to be a somewhat explosive rally so I'm curious about what your thoughts are on gold um I I often think that people who like gold are are more alike to people who like Bitcoin than they would care to admit I think the main difference is the generation that we are right so if I were born one or two generations ago I probably would have been really into gold you know but because I'm born into more of the digital age I'm more into Bitcoin so I think we're more alike than different um so I'm curious like what your thoughts are on gold here it is now 2300 2400 um max where do you you know do you think that uh this is going to continue I me Silver is also not too far behind it in its own move um and I guess the other question is like why do you think gold is rallying so that's probably the bigger question is is why do you think it's rallying rather than like what do you think it's going to go to sure yeah the gold strength is um pronounced it's very impressive um and and I would say I mean why do people buy gold historically right it's sound money it was sound money before Bitcoin it was a store of value when you know our our parents generation was nervous about the state of the world they would you know convert their into gold and uh you know a lot of it is more of a um it's a mental thing it's a it's a mental insulation it's not like if your country was invaded you're going to put you know 500 pounds of gold on your back and somehow travel to another country right but it's a it's a peace of mind thing you know and you know again historically it is you know a sound currency uh there is a scarcity aspect to it there's a lot of commonality and overlap between gold and Bitcoin and I think everything you mentioned Ben is correct um I would say that my bias on gold um really stems more on my perspective and my my forecast on where I think dxy is headed and similarly where I think Bitcoin is headed I've already shared my opinion on where I think Bitcoin is going we have the Bitcoin having just around the corner um I expect Bitcoin to you Trend upwards aggressively over the next six to nine months subsequently I do believe that dxy is forming a sort of distribute you know a distribution here I do anticipate dxy topping very soon and again if you just overlay gold with dxy on a weekly chart you can see that there is a pretty prominent negative correlation between dxy and gold so I don't think we're I'm not of the opinion that we're going to see a decoupling where there's suddenly a a prolonged period of a positive correlation where gold rallies and dxy rallies I think that one of them is lying so either gold is lying or dxy is lying I think that gold is leading and going to see dxy of course sort of reclaim that negative correlation and begin to take a dive over the next quarter so um I do expect gold to continue upwards and I think it's probably off the back of the you know dxy weakening okay yeah fair enough um it has it has been really strong you know and I I can't help but look at it I'm like wow you have like a 10-year base I the bigger the base the more explosive the rally and for I mean for I know like all the crypto you know Deens are like you know it's up what like 10% or something and like people are like you know like 10% is like a minute candle on a meme coin right but for gold you know for an asset that's that high market cap like that is a big move in a really short period of time and so like that's why it it it means something Rob what are your thoughts here um are you are you are you watching this gold move I'm not watch I mean but I own it I own gold and silver and I I think and I don't I never UND and we talk about this many times I never understood why the old maximalists and this and the precious metal maximalists hate Bitcoin so much because like you said we're trying to all do the same thing we're trying to get out of the Matrix which is relying on paper Fiat and it just seems like I there's there's that one gold bug guy that is what we all talk about for some god- awful reason but in reality I think for the majority of people that are into precious metals I think they can see the value behind it and of of of Bitcoin itself and like I I like I never understood with this guy like why don't we have a debate between that guy and like Mike Maloney Mike Maloney is huge into gold he's put out a great series on precious medals and he's he likes Bitcoin as well so like when I take a look at this I I think you know why why not own why not old gold why not diversify like you know uh we've got I diversify not just in the crypto but the stocks precious metals and and real estate and I think everybody should do the you know kind of do the same thing but to talk about why gold went up so much let me I I don't know but how did gold do in 2022 was there any kind of rally during that time I mean it it it it still mostly stayed below the high I don't really think it did that well um it's only recently really started to show strength I mean I can I can pull it up and see but 2022 was kind of split it rallied in the first half of the year and then didn't really do too much and actually corrected a little bit looks like yeah I mean it looks like it topped in March of 2022 and then basically just went down yeah till November and then it rallied again into December kind of there there's a theory going around about why Gold's rallying so much it's because the Nations that are going to war they are trying they're fearful of us sanctions so how do how do you get away get around those sanctions well you stockpile Alternatives and one of those would be of course gold so people are talking about how Iran could be could have stockpiled after the Damascus situation and the and the bombing and the reason why I ask about 2022 is because for the Ukraine Invasion I think was February 2022 and the same type of thing was being said about Russia stockpiling gold at the same time so I can see I can kind of see that that valuation I don't know why they don't just use Bitcoin it's a heck of a lot easier to transfer and zip around value but that's where we're at yeah I always like I always think those posts by the gold bugs are so disingenuous because I mean like I I own both like I own Bitcoin and gold but like if you go to trading View and you look at the Bitcoin or you look at the Gold valuation against Bitcoin it's down so much since Bitcoin launched that it rounds it to negative 100% like like that's how far the valuation of gold has fallen against Bitcoin since Bitcoin has been around so again like it's not it's just look I mean the the Bitcoin valuation as far exceeded gold for a long time um I mean my guess is over the next 20 years Bitcoin will still outperform gold you know maybe in the short term gold could outperform uh Bitcoin but and I I mean I guess it has been since March right ever since gold broke out Gold's been doing better than even the S&P 500 even the NASDAQ um it's been having my view is that I I I think that gold is breaking out because it senses that um rate cuts are coming sooner than the market is potentially thinking and so that's kind of why I think I I think it's sort of sniffing something out just like it did in 2019 and and um but we'll see I mean you know we'll see if it if it plays out in the same way last question and I mean I you know this is more so geared towards Max um because I mean Rob is I mean you know you've been around here forever we' probably even asked this question you before yeah but I mean if you want to take it if you want to answer you can Max Max yeah so since you're new here um why did you start your YouTube channel I mean like what what was your motivation what are you helping to accomplish with it uh what brings you here well Ben you you actually played a big role in in bringing me here I was a very early follower of yours actually before you even had your website I bought your Google sheet way back in the day and I'm still locked into my original price thank you very much because I got in early pays to get in early um you know I I learned a lot from you in the very beginning and I went through last cycle and you know Ben and and Rob also this you know this is a compliment to both of you guys amongst a sea of grifters and thieves and people looking to prey on unsuspecting retail you know guys like yourselves you you conducted yourselves in a manner that you know I mean I can't even imagine how many millions of dollars you guys turn down from shill deals and you know crap like that and you know I I wanted to in the beginning play my you know play my part in that I felt as though I had opinions that you know um I could share something to offer I have you know I have an ability to lead I have you know an ability to organize a team um and I wanted to play my my part my equal share in the sort of collective hive mind of you know CT and and YouTube and help educate that's sort of the underpinning of of what I'm doing is I like to teach I like to collaborate and you know making money certainly feels nice right but there's a certain there's a certain sense of fulfillment that I personally get out of somebody messaging me saying hey because of what you said it made a difference in my life and something clicked for me and that feels really good and you know I I started because Bitcoin and it was it's a small Channel still um we're growing quickly certainly which of course if you go to Ben's beautiful website and you overlay social media growth with uh you know the price of Bitcoin you can see why I'm starting to grow quicker it's it's I'm doing the same thing I was doing all bare Market it's just suddenly more people care about crypto so um you know I am a i a result of good times and I pray that they continue on because of course it's you know a nice Tailwind for for my young business but yeah I mean really to answer the question Point Blank I love to teach I love to to collaborate and I love to debate you know like I have a differing opinion than you know you guys for some things and there's some overlap but that's what makes a market beautiful is that you can think one thing I can think another and we can come together and just talk about it politely and nobody knows what's going to happen right like we can't I have my hunch I have conviction just like you guys do but Bitcoin dominance could go to 90% And you know even over flip it and put that on on Twitter don't do that don't do that or or it could literally nuke down to 10% we could have like the crypto equivalent of the NASDAQ bubble between 1995 and 2000 where altcoins bubble like people you know can't imagine everybody's thrown money at altcoins speculating anything that's crypto and then 99 out of 100 of them don't exist in a couple years you know so who who knows what's going to happen but yeah I love to to collaborate and teach and debate and uh generally it's it's just a passion of mine how many subscribers are you guys at now like 13 14k or something yes on YouTube somewhere in between there yeah well there's 3,600 people watching so if everyone here goes and clicks the link in the description below and goes over to Max's Channel and subscribes then uh I I'm sure he would appreciate that and I think he deserves that he's been they've been putting out they it's not just Max by the way I mean it's a team of people um so go check that out you guys do like daily live streams right we Yeah we actually have a show coming up at uh 10:00 a.m. eastern time we do a Daily Show we've got a panel of Five Guys we're all just Traders wrap this one up then if you got it coming up in 10 minutes that's okay I got a big team they got it all right well before we before we end it here I I did want to take at least a couple of questions um and one of the questions I saw was um what is the best way to learn about crypto and to do your own research so I mean I don't know if they're talking about like from a fundamental perspective but I if someone were getting into crypto like like what do you guys use to do your research and I mean and maybe talk about like all the different tool or some at least some of the bigger tools that you guys have been using especially for all the different things that are happening in the cryptoverse there seems like there's a thousand different narratives that you could you know that you could follow and whoever wants to take that one is fine go ahead Max yeah um I would start on uh one of our three channels I think that's a really good place not to not to spew the obvious but um I would say I would say learn to do very basic ta right and understand Cycles like there's some very awesome free indicators out there like I mean you can even just look at like you know Ben has a a you he's kind of coined a very famous one he's combined a 20 week SMA and a 21 we EMA which has been sort of uh marketed as the bull market band for good reason right so you can determine when you know Bitcoin is trending upwards High time frame or trending down by just a simple you moving average band there's also things like the P Cycle top which I think people should keep an eye on which is again a free trading view indicator someone someone made it it's also on Ben's website there's also some some good onchain stuff like you know Bitcoin terminal price hoddle waves things like that I would as a beginner I would stay off the hourly time frame like literally just go daily time frame and above um and whenever you see Bitcoin down you know 50% from its its all-time high that's time to start paying attention to maybe consider entering the market but you know learn very very basic ta and and some of the more popular onchain indicators can really help you just DCA at the right time you know but stay off of the hourly time frames mainly the py cycle top just to give credit is uh was developed by Philip Swift um a while back and I the the idea was to predict the top with within 3 days and it did a really great job of doing that in the first uh the first 2021 Peak um and it actually happened I remember it happening and like no one really believed it you know um but I think it was retrofit right it was fit after yeah it was created in 2019 it was created in 2019 okay but it did it did get the first top in 2021 I feel like a lot of these like metrics that everyone created in 2019 uh it they called the first top but then most of them like didn't really call the second top because it was just sort of like a it was like a dead cat bounce that just somehow made it to New highs you know yeah um so yeah that was kind of an interesting one um Rob did you have anything to add just yeah just one thing Max makes all great points the thing I would say is that if you really knew you really really knew you have to understand that it's not how much you make it's how much you keep and the big thing is that you have to watch out for scams and things to watch out for and if you're gonna get into like hot storage wallets stuff like that there's a there's a video in the in the link of in the description of all my videos and it says you know things you the the big mistakes in crypto and it has like 20,000 views and of course it's the most important video I probably have ever put out because that's what people get screwed out and they get scammed out and if they watch that video they wouldn't happen to them another video I did when I'm gonna sell on my crypto has over 100,000 views so it just goes to show you like where the priorities are the priorities are make money but really the priority should be keep money someone's asking a um this the Market's not pricing it in right now but I did see like last night there's been a couple of times here where like there's at least some in investors like thinking about a rate hike um that is not like my base case at all like I think they're done I I think five and a half percent is the terminal rate for this cycle they might go higher next cycle uh but I I think five and a half percent at the top I'm not going to ask you if you think they're gonna hike again because I don't really think any of us think they're going to um if you do think that let me know but I guess my main question is what do you think would happen if they did hike again um because that be I mean that would talk about markets not pricing it in right I mean like I guess the the implication would be like if if the economy just accelerates into you know again and and there's not a cool down and we just keep on moving up uh what would a rate what would another rate hike do well what was real quick what was what is what has Jerome Powell said about fighting inflation do they say that they're on the right track or do they say like there's it's more more stubborn what he they've kind of like the progress has slowed a lot and I I think they've kind of specul that it it might influence their the number of rate Cuts this year because previously they had said three rate Cuts this year and I'm I'm wondering if they're starting to walk I mean now the market is pricing in only two rate cuts through April of 2025 so I my view is that you know I thought higher for longer but now that everyone else believes it I think I think it's going to go back the other way because once the market fully prices in no rate Cuts that's when people give up and you need to start having some rate cuts um but yeah I don't know I mean pal Po's basically said the same thing he said for the last three years if you know they're they're going to keep rates higher for longer until inflation's durably going back to 2% yeah I I think that 3% is is the new 2% truthfully I I I appreciate their narrative and their consistency and and how they haven't wavered on that and I think it's a great goal um but it seems like three is kind of a magnet actually a little above three um like you mentioned they are currently pricing in now it looks like you know our first 25 basis point cut on the uh September 18th meeting and then through April 2025 and and these percentages change all the time right uh you know we'll see what happens um you know potentially taking us down 50 basis points off of where we're currently at um let me answer your question what would happen if we got another 25 basis point hike because you know inflation decides it's going to rear its ugly head again and and start trending up above you know headline four 5% God forbid it's over I mean like we are going to absolutely nuke if we get another rate I'm gonna be as as clear as I can be if we get another rate hike markets are going to capitulate like that will be awful horrible for risk like sell all of your assets honestly like if that happens I'm not joking I think it'd be terrible I don't know if you guys agree with me but that would be horrible for markets but I don't think that's going to happen to be clear I think you could have the same thing happen if they just refuse to cut soon enough too because like it it you know like a tightening cycle is not just raising rates but it's also keeping rates too high for too long and the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and eight would have been in March um so we've already gone nine I think there's still you know there's still a window where talks about a soft Landing right it's so hard to thread that needle to a soft Landing because you have to stay high enough to make sure inflation doesn't come back in a second wave because if you don't and you get an inflation a secondary wave like the 70s you get a hard Landing but if you stay high for too long like let's say they stay at five and a half percent for another six months then you start to run the risk of of a deflationary crash right so that's why everyone sort of rolls their eyes about a soft Landing is because it's so difficult to thread that needle and I don't I do not envy their job I I do not envy their job because it's not and and they're also operating with long and variable lags like how can they know all the effects of prior monetary policy um so yeah it's it's a tough place for them to be and and we are oh sorry Rob go ahead no no go ahead Max I was going to say you know we are seeing some smaller economies in my opinion forecasting when our rate cuts are coming like we have seen the Czech Republic actually start to cut we've seen Poland cut um so it you know historically it's not perfect right but you are starting to see some of these smaller countries actually they they LED through the hik so they began to hike first they paused first and they've actually started to cut so I I do anticipate that you know in similar fashion to what has happened historically we will see the US begin to I guess cut rates hopefully uh later this year um but I do agree with you Ben like if they held rates where they're currently at through you know all of 2024 that would also put some pressure um on our economy and our markets but with that said like I don't know what you you guys think but I mean really the the final you know real dagger or Domino to fall is going to be of course unemployment creeping up above four four and a half percent do you guys think that if they just held rates where they're currently at all through 2024 um but we didn't see the labor market really deteriorate could financial markets hold up in that instance I mean if if the labor market doesn't deteriorate sure I just think that um I mean it seems like the unemployment rate is trending up um and the the problem with with that is that it doesn't tend to move in a linear fashion right it it goes slow and then it starts to accelerate at some point and we haven't reached the acceleration phase right so there's still a chance that we can avoid it but the longer they wait the the the riskier that's going to be I think I think there's a higher probability of a rate cut this summer than the market is giving credit for I don't think it has to happen this summer but I think the right thing to do is to cut at least 25 basis points uh this summer 50 basis points something like that just uh provide something you know are you thinking in the June meeting or July meeting I mean look last cycle I know that that the altcoin market was a lens into the consumer and I know that that when alts broke down against Bitcoin and when eth broke down against Bitcoin the FED basically cut one month later um and we we have seen eth fall against Bitcoin it had a weekly close below the June low we saw madic Bitcoin uh crash below it's June 2022 low we've seen adaa Bitcoin and Dot bit coin we've seen Litecoin Bitcoin and a Bitcoin I mean so many of these altcoins are are falling off their Bitcoin support levels and you can see it with the Bitcoin dominance so I think that the pricing out of all these rate Cuts is going to cause them to get priced in because the FED does not base their decisions on what our altcoins are doing right un they don't care what I what I what I find unfortunate is that a lot of the small like companies like Mom and Pop shops a lot of them are going out of business business right now because you know rates are going up and and and times are getting harder like inflation is so high so people just can't afford as much and but the FED has to do it because all of us Deens in the in the space can't help ourselves from bidding up jpegs you know and and and leading inflation uh to to where it was so I think that it's it's kind of a tough spot to be and the FED has to stay long enough to kind of break the animal spirits but if they do it too long then you then then you run the other issue of of a deflationary um unwind and that's not really fun either I know like people are like oh I'd love to go to the store and not spend as much money but if you if prices go down that's probably not good for risk assets terrible just yeah so everybody everybody who's watching the videos remember this when when you think like okay the Bitcoin Market or the crypto Market has to do this thing it has to do this thing because it's it's been the cycle that's always done this doesn't actually work like what we just talked about just how fragile the markets actually are and just to think how things have to really go in line before you realize that oh maybe I should have taken some profits when there was uh everything was overheated just it's just something to think about because I hate people who roundtrip and uh they really should again take some profits when everything gets too hot and and one thing just to mention about rate cuts and I mean you guys probably know this rate Cuts inherently are not bearish right it's it's the underpinning as to why they are cutting rates and you know if you actually on a granular level you go and you overlay the effective federal funds rate with you know the NASDAQ or S&P 500 markets actually tend to rally for like 30 to 60 days give or take following the First Rate cut until they wake up and they realize oh crap there's economic deterioration under the surface which is why they're cutting rates and then we see these major Corrections so I think whether the first 25 basis point comes in June or the end of July meeting or I guess hopefully September um that's probably your 30 to 60-day warning truthfully whenever it comes and I don't know when it will and what about no go ahead I was going to say you're right I mean like the rate Cuts inherently are are are bullish for risk assets if they're cutting for the right reasons in 2019 while Bitcoin topped out when rate Cuts arrived the S&P 500 kept going up and you know because the mark like the the economy was not in a recession right it wasn't going into a recession they were sort of like preliminary rate Cuts You could argue that Bitcoin is more tied to financial markets today traditional markets today than it was back then because of the spot ETF so maybe it would track the S&P 500 a bit closer than it did last cycle once rate Cuts arrive but the issue is why the FED is cutting are they cutting because they're trying to get ahead of something bad that's coming or are they cutting as a reactionary thing because they just saw a really bad labor market prance and that is is when they're not bullish like that's when rate cuts are be so it all depends on Max is right it all depends on why they're cutting and and I think that it's also risky to I I I do believe that there's just as much risk to the UPS side truthfully where you know assuming that they're going to cut because there is severe economic deterioration can also be you know a very harmful strategy long term because like you mentioned the first batch of rate cuts that we saw in 2019 um you know the S&P 500 rallied out of those cuts like 15% and then of course we had our Co nuke in March which took us below you know where that that first uh cut occurred right but you know again it's like you have to be very careful you kind of threading your own needle per se because just because they're cutting doesn't mean sell everything right because they could cut you know the labor market could be more resilient than anybody's expecting the S&P 500 could go up 50% over the next year and then something bad happens and you get a correction but that correction doesn't take you down to as low as the point in which the first cut happens so you just have to be a little bit careful truthfully you know you have to really understand why they're cutting and and it's a tough thing to do it's very tough I me with the S&P you know there there's been all sorts of like crises throughout all the decades but if you just pull up a chart over a 100 years I mean you know the the the overall trend is clear you know um the markets generally go up because the money supply yeah yeah you know why did prices of houses go up 40% because the supply of money went up 40 per. you know it's not it's not I it's not really that complicated so yeah no I mean I think like as always right like time in the market often beats time the market um because it's impossible to to actually time the market for under most circumstances and I think sometimes people get lucky with it and then assume that they're like a genius and can do it again and again and again um but the reality is that the market will humble us all at some point why don't we go ahead and wrap it up there um we we'll have NFA live back I guess next week next week I think it'll be on Rob's Channel um so we'll see you guys over there next week and again if you're not subscribed uh to to Max or Rob links for their channels are in the description

      "Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin the having approaches if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe crypto.com links in the description below make sure you guys check that out we're going to end the sale after the having sometime this weekend I don't know exactly when but I would go ahead and get it now if you want the subscription at the lower rate before we jump in I I would like to say thank you to everyone who is a subscriber here I like to kind of take a step back when I hit these major milestones and just say you know I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing it means the world to be at 800,000 subscribers you know when I started the channel I had no idea that it it would grow to be this big uh but here we are and I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing to the channel and I know I don't get everything right and I I do get things wrong um but I do appre appreciate you guys sticking with me uh either way so I just wanted to to acknowledge that and to say thank you to everyone for being a subscriber also the the having is is almost here and in fact by the time you watch this video the having's probably already happened um I'll try to get the video out here uh in a in a in you know 30 minutes or so um if we take a look when it's going to occur at least from when I'm recording this video it's going to be about 5 hours um but by the time you're watching this video it's probably going to be a lot less and it could already be behind us if you go look at the um at the the how many blocks it looks like we only have about 30 blocks to go so it is coming up really really soon and I I just think it's such a big event I'm going to try to live stream it that's my goal is to try to live stream the event uh it is in about again 5 hours it's going to be a little tricky cuz that's going to sort of correspond with some uh bedtime routines for my kids uh but I will try to to to live stream it if I can uh so do look out for that here in the next four or I guess by the time you're watching this video it'll be a different time but ideally I'm going to try to get get on here live by 8:30 Eastern um is my goal but again no promises so Bitcoin is is currently at at 64k we're going to keep this pretty short um because I mean you guys know my thoughts on the market but I do just want to say you know there there's a couple of different scenarios that could play out and I'm sure you've seen me talk about him a thousand times you've probably seen everyone else talk about him a thousand times the the sort of the two main short-term things so sort of the most likely outcomes in the short term are either you go straight to the 20we SMA following the habing or you get a bounce first to go just north of the 8 week moving average and then you resolve to a a lower low in May um off of off of whatever low this is you know so those are the sort of the two most likely shortterm outcomes to me again I I don't know which one will play out I I could certainly find evidence for both I will say you know with the S&P 500 at its own bull market support ban I I really do Wonder like well if if the S&P can go to it 20we SMA why can't Bitcoin you know I mean it's been a long time and with the S&P it had been really since November since it had been at its 20we SMA and now it's there once again and I wonder like you know with Bitcoin what's to keep it from going to its own 20we SMA it hasn't seen it since really mid October so if the S&P 500 can go there why can't Bitcoin in fact it's not even just the S&P if you were to look at at eth you can see it's been wicking down to its 20we moving average already you can see the riskier assets are already hitting it um if you look at at total three you can see that it's already been wicking down to its bull market support band so as you go you know further up the risk curve it's easier for those assets to hit that 20we SMA because when Bitcoin sneezes the the the altcoin market gets annihilated and you can see that I mean Bitcoin is still well above its 20we moving average in fact I mean in fact for it to go to its 20we SMA it would require about another 15 % drop from the current prices the problem with that for things like eth and and alts is that if Bitcoin were to do that then they likely go below their bull market support bands and this is exactly what we saw in 2019 right we saw eth go below its bull market support band after that local top just after eth Bitcoin broke down before Bitcoin did so that when Bitcoin bounced off of its 20we ese in the short term even didn't hold it as support eventually it bounced off of it ethusd basically just held resistance at the bull market support band so I I do think there there's some some reason to think it could play out like that you know as much as there there very well could be sort of a relief into late April early May um just keep an eye on on the 20we SME because you know the hard part with it is that you know you can look at at at prior local tops right you can look at things like 2021 and and 2019 and see that they had these rallies back up to the 8-week moving average on their first weekly close below the 8we moving average right so the first weekly close below the 8we right here in 2019 we rallied right back above the 8we and then formed a lower high in 2021 right same type of thing right go below the 8 we and then rally on back up the thing is is like we could see a weekly close below the 8we but we haven't necessarily even seen it yet also note that in 2019 after you had that rally back above the 8we it was after a 34% drop you know at this time Bitcoin has really only dropped about the same amount that it has been about 20% right I mean you know as much as it might feel like it's it's been more brutal this time that's only because the altcoin market is getting hammered but that's what alts do best in you know when Bitcoin sneezes alts get annihilated so you can see that so far this is a pretty standard drop for Bitcoin right 20% nothing too different from what we've seen um but do note that while it is 20% the the rally back to the 8we SMA in 2019 occurred after it had gone down you know closer to 30% which would actually get you near that 20we moving average so it's really hard to say and and while it is convenient of course to compare to 2019 and early 21 because you know I'm sure everyone would like that rally back up to the8 week SMA there's also other examples uh like like 20 late 2021 where you get something like this where you you know you're putting in these weekly closes where the Wicks are lower right you can see that right the Wicks are lower there as well just like they were over here um but you ended up just getting a capitulation down right so there's no guarantee right there's no guarantee with the market and I think like I I think honestly we're not going to you know next week will be sort of the decision point on on if you're going to bounce off of it or not um this week I imagine it's not going to you know we're not going to fully know I mean this you know it's already Friday anyways but yeah I I think it's just I mean it's certainly interesting because you're not only looking at at Bitcoin sort of slowly fading back in uh but you can see that a lot of other markets are as well right like the S&P is down to its bull market support band eth is down to its bull market support band or at least it has been wicking there it's not there at the current moment but it has been for the last couple of days off and on and then you have some altcoins that are below their 20we SMA already right I mean um I'm sure a lot of them are right I don't know if link is yeah link is Ada is Litecoin is not surprisingly madic is um dot is I mean a lot of them are already below their Market sport band so you can see that like the stronger assets are still above it Bitcoin is still above it right now but you know I I look at these other markets you know even the Russell the Russell is below it right so this is a great example of how the S&P is at the 20 we but the Russell is below it so you could see something happen very very similar in crypto where Bitcoin goes to its 20 we and when it does if and when it does then maybe alts go below it right that could could very well play out sometime after the having whether you get a rally to the 8we SMA or not right and again I don't know um if we're going to go to the 8 week ese next week or if it's going to be like you know a month later I could easily come up with a reason for either scenario easily easily it it's going to depend on what your bias is um so I I really I really can confidently say I don't know which one's going to play out but I will say that regardless of whether you get a relief to the 8we or not my expectation is that Bitcoin will go to the 20we moving average within the next few weeks right you know within probably either this month or next month is my guess I mean it's been a long time right I mean it seems like we're due for it in 2019 you know it it took about 25 weeks you know something like that in you know 2020 or so all the way through 2021 we fell back into it in in May in fact and that was about 32 weeks we're currently at what 26 weeks right so my guess is you know sometime in the next 6 weeks we're going to find ourselves at the bull market support band and then we'll see what's up again my guess is that if if Bitcoin sort of chops around in this range for a few months that's what should send the Bitcoin dominance to 60% right so if it goes down to the 20e Ese and then it bounces back up for a little bit to the 8we ese or vice versa goes to the a week first and then goes to the 20 week it's that chopping process that should break the altcoin market down and I mean you can see it already happening you know with eth Bitcoin which is something we've been following you know for a long time you know it's now at 0482 now it is you know talking about this sort of stuff on the the sort of the cusp of a major Bitcoin event you know there could be counter Trend rallies for this stuff but again you know my guess is that eth Bitcoin is is just sort of doing something like this after breaking down where it it sort of TR to hold on for a week but inevitably it keeps on bleeding into into the summer months where maybe it finally can potentially bottom so that is my view here going into into the having remember if there is a larger drop in the crypto verse uh following the having whether it's immediately after or whether it's delayed by a few weeks one thing to remember right one thing that I I I think you should remember is that when you measure things from the peak and you go Peak to Peak Bitcoin is ahead of schedule by a lot right it really is it can afford to give back a lot of that and still be in line with prior Cycles we've said that forever this is why I've said Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio because it's going to outperform the altcoin marketing till QE Returns the problem for alts you know I'll tell you the problem for alts is that if Bitcoin just drops back down here to get back in line with the prior Cycles just like last cycle it dropped back in line to get to get back in line with its prior cycle if Bitcoin drops here to get back in line with the last two cycles guess what alts can go back down to their lows or they can put in new lows because they're not that far off of their lows to begin with whereas Bitcoin is right you know Bitcoin is already well off its low whereas the alts a lot of them are not now some of them are but a lot of most of them are not really that far off of their low so I mean you know if you see a situation where Bitcoin just simply goes back to where it you know where it was in the last two cycles at this point that's how the altcoin market can put in you know a lot of alts can put in new lows even in the having year and we saw that happen last cycle as well and and I know there's always going to be some type of reason for it or justification or rationalization but that is just what I've seen you know cycle after cycle after cycle is that alts can get that bounce in the prehab year but inevitably as you get later on in the business cycle and we get you know as the Market is really starting to digest all those rate hikes and and the FED refusing to Pivot sufficiently that's where alts you know the order books are thin and that's where they just continue to slowly bleed uh not only on their USD pairs but also their Bitcoin Pairs and then my guess is that once you start getting multiple weekly closes by Bitcoin below its 20we moving average I think there's a good chance that at that point Bitcoin dominance has topped but between now and then I think that you're going to see it you're going to see Bitcoin USD sort of chop around in this range for a couple of months um and during that time I I think the Bitcoin dominance will go uh to 60% as eth Bitcoin goes to 003 to 04 and and all Bitcoin pairs go all the way back down from 0 42 to where they currently are down to about .25 best case scenario and that's if you want to say that they're oscillators right so back down to 0.25 or so so that is is really my view right now on the market um there are also sort of other views that you could look at that sort of revolve around if it wants to follow some of the prior you know the prior Trends with some major geopolitical events we did see Bitcoin over here you know put in some scary Wicks back in early 2022 um and then they still swept the local high after that so there is always a chance that something like that happens as well um so be ready for anything uh but I I do think that the market would greatly benefit from a a summer lull where it just kind of gets boring for a little while and all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out that's what I think would be the best case for the cryptoverse is a a summer where all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out because no one cares anymore you know all the hype is behind us and then then you start to see them find their true lows on their Bitcoin pairs you know for everyone who is who's laughed at the idea of the devaluation of all Bitcoin pairs they just put in a new low last week right they just put in a new new low last week so don't laugh at it I mean this is just what happened last cycle you know it's just exactly what happened and and if they do come back down here like over here then I I think there's no debating anymore that it it really is following sort of what 2019 was it's just that the reason why it was delayed until the having year was because rate Cuts occur potentially now in the having year as opposed to the preh having year like last cycle so to me it all looks like it's playing out in a very similar manner where all Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows just before rate Cuts arrive the onset of rate Cuts potentially as early as this summer should allow a Bitcoin pairs to bottom out and then a USD pairs can find whatever low they're going to find um based on how how low Bitcoin goes and then perhaps by the last rate cut uh then you start to see it go the other way the biggest Counterpoint to all these views is if it's a um you know if we just get some manic blowoff top or something this summer uh following some type of left translated cycle I mean you could have a left translated cycle where the top is is March right I mean that's what happened in the dot crash right I mean that the top was in March of the election year that's not really my base case though um but I I would say I would say that if you are to get a left translated cycle where Bitcoin just goes parabolic into all the um into all the bad news and everything then you know then that would sort of invalidate the views that I'm expressing um my base case though is that we are just simply repeating what we saw uh back over here and all Bitcoin pairs should come down as we get into this summer and and by you know maybe by June July something like that I I could see all Bitcoin pairs finally bottoming out not withstanding Maybe some future Bitcoin parabolic rally which we saw over here but that is is you know really my view on the market right now and we will see if it if it continues to pan out or not in the meantime bitcoin's at 64k um and we'll see if it if it goes to the 20we estimate in the next couple of weeks or if instead it first rallies back up to just above or just around its 8we moving average um uh first but either way I do think we are due for a test of the bullmark sport band here in the next you know month month and a half if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on

      "Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the having if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom the sale will be ending just after the having so make sure you check it out and lock in the lower rate let's go ahead and jump in the Bitcoin having is probably one of the most significant events in our industry I often find people debating every cycle you know whether the having is priced in or not whether it has an effect on pric or not my view is that you know we've had three having before we had one in 2012 one in 2016 and of course one in 2020 and I I certainly do think that the having does play a role in the cycles of the crypto verse um I also think that monetary policy plays a role but I don't really fall in either Camp completely I don't think that it's only based on supply side stuff and I don't think it is only based on you know monetary policy I think it's a combination of of different things markets are complex um they're they're based on a lot of different things and so because the having is one of the most important events I wanted to do a video where we talk about it and talk about where where I have previously said that theit the price of Bitcoin may be now price predictions are honestly something that I'm not super into um because usually you know usually price predictions don't really turn out that great if if you put in a price prediction and it goes above it then you know the comments aren't so nice and if you put a price prediction and we don't quite get there you know people are also upset but I wanted to to revisit something that I said four years ago and kind of see like where are we with respect to that so four years ago I put out this video Bitcoin Fair valuation at the next tabing in 2024 I put out this video in 2020 in May of 2020 the price of Bitcoin was around $8,000 and what I said back then was that if we follow the fair value logarithmic regression trend line then by the fourth having which is the having that's about to occur the price to bitcoin would be between 40 to $50,000 okay that's what I said back then clearly we are above that price right clearly if we go back and look at the video that I put out a year ago or no this was at the end of 2022 um or mid 2022 just before the the the um the final collapse occurred I also sort of Drew it out going to around a 40 to 50K so with Bitcoin right now at 63k it's ahead right I mean there's no denying it it's ahead of where I said it was going to be back then now of course back then putting out a price prediction four years later um and and hoping that it would be accurate at all was probably something I was fairly naive about uh but here we are 4 years later and the price of Bitcoin is actually above the target range that I put and it's also above this area that I put as well going into the having and so with that in mind I I want to discuss a couple of things that that may come up after the having um that could very well uh take some people by surprise now there's a lot of different thoughts to this current cycle with it being you know so hot at this point in the cycle we've never seen the market put in new highs before the having right this is the first time ever that Bitcoin has put in new highs before the having and so that was you know probably one of the reasons why back then I I didn't think it would be quite so high but we are at new highs before the having and so I just want to talk about what you know what to potentially expect after the happing now there's two different trends of thought here one of which is a left translated Peak okay now to be completely honest I'm not really in the left translated Peak camp but it does have like maybe 40% of my attention and the reason for that is if you were to take the ROI of Bitcoin from Peak to Peak and you take it from the April Peak Peak instead of the November 2021 Peak and you compare it to last cycle it sort of looks like it potentially could form into a peak sooner rather than later in which case you would get a left translated top meaning the the the actual top occurs way before anyone thinks it will historically Bitcoin has topped out in the fourth quarter of the post having year so if you look at Major Peaks that Bitcoin has had in the past if I were to get an arrow here you can see that this top was in Q4 of the post having year this one was in Q4 of the post having year and this one was in Q4 of the posst having Year we're currently in Q2 of the having year so you know that is is still about six quarters away when Bitcoin typically tops but again so far this cycle is anything but typical with Bitcoin putting in new before the having so if it is to translate into a left translated Peak a left translated cycle then it would be more likely that the top would occur in 2024 as opposed to 2025 if we are going to follow that then I have to imagine that we would follow potentially what happened last cycle now it's not really my base cas but again it would be foolish not to at least acknowledge the similarities but on the other hand where I would say 60% of my attention is right now is what if this cycle is just like prior cycles and we are all over here jumping through hoops trying to explain why this time is different when potentially it just Peaks when it normally does and one way that we could go about getting to that point would be that if we had a cool off in the summer okay now there's no guarantee and if we follow this path then you might see the exact opposite of a summer lull but if there is a summer lull then one thing to keep in mind when you look at the last two cycles as measured Peak to Peak you can see that at this point in the cycle Bitcoin was only up or it was it was actually still about 60% down from its all-time high now I want you to think about that for a minute in both prior Cycles at this point as measured Peak to Peak Bitcoin was 60% below the all-time high 60% below it now right now Bitcoin is not 60% below the prior high in fact 60% below the prior High would put Bitcoin all the way down at around $26,000 that's how accelerated we are this cycle look at the last cycle 60% down from that Peak you can see that by May of 2020 that was when the having occurred Bitcoin was down 60% from the high and then if you go back to the cycle before that this the that the having occurred in July if I remember correctly and if you go to July of 2016 you will see that Bitcoin was approximately down 60% from the high this having it's not right it's not 60% down from the high in fact it is at the high it's at the high which has never happened before so this has caused a lot of people to view this cycle as different from the prior ones and I have to tell you they make a fair point they make make a fair point and if you measure it from the April top you can kind of see that Bitcoin is doing just about what it always does at this point in the cycle if you take the April top as the more important top and of course there is evidence to suggest that the April top is the more important top for instance some of that evidence to suggest the April top is the more important top is to look at views to a lot of different cryptocurrency YouTube channels and to note that there were more views in the first half of 2021 than there were in the second half where Bitcoin basically just put in a lower high in terms of social activity but somehow a higher high in terms of price if you look at Bitcoin with respect to its 50e moving average one of the things that it does after every major cycle top is that it goes back down to the 50 we and then gets a bounce a dead cap bounce before ultimately capitulating we saw that happen over here as well go back to the 50 we get a dead bounce and then go all the way down this past cycle we did not see that exactly what happened was we went back to the 50 we and instead of it just being a dead cap bounce to a lower high which is what potentially that would have been we ended up getting a higher high which took a lot of people off guard now I was optimistic of a higher high but honestly I think because of for for wrong reasons you know and sometimes you get things right for the wrongs reasons and and it's important to take that into consideration so we can see that that happened right we can see that we went to the 50 we we got a bounce but that time it actually led to a higher high the even the intermediate bull market in 2019 had us bouncing off the 50 week at some point and so the 50 we today is at around 40K it's at 39.2k 39.3k which is interesting because again that is way below the current prices way below current prices and I have to imagine that if we do not evolve into a left translated top if we do not right so there's two op you know there's two options right we evolve into a left translated top where the peak occurs in 2024 or we evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 if we're going to evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 you really need to see Bitcoin cool off for a while and again as measured Peak to Peak you can see just how far quote unquote ahead of schedule this cycle is it's actually not that unfamiliar when you think about it the reason it seems like this time is different is because Bitcoin is at new all-time Highs but if you look at the last cycle there was a period where it too was well above its prior cycle but what eventually happened is it bled back down and basically got in line with the prior cycle and then still ended up showing diminishing returns okay and then it actually got ahead of that cycle again this is why a lot of people thought we were going to go to 300 K last cycle but it still was diminishing returns so I want to continue to put forth this idea that if we do not evolve into a left translated Peak sometime around the having and instead the market cools off going into the summer then you might just see something like this where it causes the cycle to just get back in line with prior Cycles now that of course could make a lot of people think that the cycle that the peak is over and and the Bull Run is is is completely done and and maybe they're right right but there is at least some evidence to suggest that that could be what is ultimately in store for us as we get lat into the cycle if you're not familiar with how the last cycle worked and why we what what happened when we bled back down here there's a number of things that really put Bitcoin back into a intermediate bare Market sort of you had a a quantitative tightening bull market and then a bare Market as rate Cuts arrived and then a QE bull market that topped in 2025 now take a a look at Bitcoin this cycle and see how it's doing something very very similar in the sense that it's had this major run during High interest rates you can see it's had this run during High interest rates and in fact if you were to look very closely at when the FED paused here and compare it to this you can see something very similar happened right it it fell just after the FED paused here it fell just after the FED paused and then it went up quite a lot but ultimately what happened is that it it found a local top as just before rate Cuts arrived and then it bled for a while before getting another bull run into the post having year now by the way the having is only four four days away so if we do come up and put in a new local high before the having or maybe around the having that still doesn't necessarily invalidate the idea of the market cooling off sometime after the having if the left translated Peak is not going to occur okay so again there's two thoughts you have a left translated Peak where us Deens just can't help ourselves and everyone just front run runs everything until until the consumer caves or the other idea which would support the idea of this time not being different would just for the cycle to get back in line now if the cycle gets back in line then maybe this view from four years ago of around a you know 40 to 50K Bitcoin by the fourth having isn't that far off I know right now if we were to go back to 40 to 50 okay it would probably feel like the world's falling apart for a lot of people but one thing to consider is that when when e I'm you know I don't know how I made it this far in the video without talking about it one thing to consider last cycle is that the 30% drop Bitcoin had pretty shallow drops during this QT bull market right pretty shallow drops and then eventually it finally got a 30% drop that 30% drop corresponded precisely to the point when eth Bitcoin broke down and eth Bitcoin just broke down below the summer 2022 low so if you were to get a 30% drop sometime after the having that would actually put you kind of right around that range that we said way back over here and in addition to that it would also get you Loosely backed in line with where the prior Cycles were so going into this Bitcoin having is certainly different in the sense that we've never seen a new all-time high before the habing if you were to go look at the risk metric of Bitcoin you will see that the risk on bitcoin has never been this High going into the having in fact the last time we went into the the the 20 when we went into the 2020 having the risk of Bitcoin was at 04 when you look at the 2016 having in July of 2016 the risk on bitcoin was 0.4 today the Bitcoin risk is6 so it's actually quite a bit higher than it was during the last two 3 to4 this time we find ourselves at 639 and only a few weeks ago the risk was in the 7 to8 risk band to give you an idea of what the 04 risk band would look like which is where we were going into the last two that's where the 04 to 0.5 wristband is that's where the price of Bitcoin was at the last two Habs and you can see actually that Bitcoin when those rate Cuts arrived right here had that correction back to the 100 we moving average now what's fascinating about that is that it would correspond to the prior breakout zone so I I I feel like there's two different ways that we can look at the market here here that make the most amount of sense number one is that this is not different from the prior cycles and we're kind of on track with where we should be and that could be viewed by maybe looking at the ROI after the after the low if you look at the ROI after the low and you compare this cycle with two cycles ago this is exactly where we were but you can see that it at this point it did cool off for a while and then did get a drop kind of um you know this was day 520 or so about you know a month and a half from now or so so you can view it like that or you can view it from the peak and still say we're where we should be based on uh based on measuring it from the April top right if you take this out Peak to Peak if you measure it from the April top we're pretty much where we should be but again I can't help but think are we are we are we doing the same thing again where everyone tries to come up with a reason for why this time is different but in reality it's not so my thought process on the matter is this as we go into the Bitcoin having if Bitcoin accelerates into the having and post having and into June right if it is something like that where you know over here in 2019 in fact before rate Cuts arrived it actually did rally in until June last year we had a a local top in April but then we swept the high in June if we get something like that where Bitcoin continues to go up throughout the summer then I would be more in tune with the idea of a left translated top where you get a top in 2024 as opposed to say 2025 however on the other hand if you get a low Top by Bitcoin here as rate Cuts arrive and then instead of you know and that could still include sweeping the prior high right but if you get a look kind of like we did over here with the spot ETF we we put in a new high on the day of the spot ETF for the cycle if on the other hand we see the market cool off into the summer and go to say the 04 to 0.5 wristband or even the 0. 3 to point4 wristband and we get the market more back in line with the prior two cycles then I I think that perhaps the base case should still be that the cycle is playing out just as it always has and you still could get a top in in late 2025 and in fact it was this very intermediate bare Market that kind of scared a lot of people off in fact what happens if something like that happens again where rate Cuts arrive and you go back down scares a lot of people off and then because everyone gets scared off the FED starts printing money again and then you get a QE bow Market I've said this before and I'll say it again there's two types of bull markets in crypto there's quantitative tightening bull markets that occur during periods when the FED is lowering reducing the assets on their balance sheet that's what we got in 2019 and that's what we've got over here and during those periods during those periods eth Bitcoin goes down eth Bitcoin goes down during QT quantitative tightening bull markets how many people for the last couple of years have said that eth outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market that's not true not without any disclaimer because as you can see bitcoin's been going up since late November of 2022 and eth Bitcoin has been going down the entire time so that is why I still think there is some evidence to suggest the cycle may play out like it always does rather than a left translated top I'm not completely unsympathetic to the idea of a left translated Peak there's a lot of really smart people out there that frankly provide a compelling case for it and I could honestly provide a compelling case for it I just showed you guys some of the different charts but if Bitcoin does not run into the highest wristbands the 0. N to one wristband this summer and instead it just cools off like it did back over here after the having it might scare a lot of people off but perhaps it's just doing what it did last cycle and it the only reason that the top the local the midcycle top came later was because rate Cuts came later this cycle than they did last cycle so you have quantitative tightening bull markets where Bitcoin goes up as e Bitcoin bleeds all Bitcoin pairs bleed and then you have QE bull markets that go where Bitcoin goes up as eth Bitcoin goes up so eth outperforms Bitcoin in a QE Market but not a QT Market there's two different different types of bull markets so that is a very important distinction and I think we've only received more and more evidenced over the last year that Bitcoin really is dependent somewhat on monetary policy because last September when eth Bitcoin came back down to to this area right here there were there were a lot of people that thought that it had bottomed because that's when it had bottomed in the last cycle Q3 of the pre having year this development here which is what I said was likely going to happen this development of the the devaluation of eth against Bitcoin shows that the market is very much dependent on monetary policy whether we want to believe it or not so if that is the case right if that continues to be the case then you very well could see a a repeat of what happened over here sort of an intermediate Lull in the market followed by because of rate Cuts right that occur during rate Cuts followed by the last rate cut which leads to a QE bull market where you maybe top out when you normally do in the latter part of the post tapping year so two different theories if you're new here that's what is you know has really been discussed over the last uh year or so is this cycle different is it not I honestly think if you if you have a bias on it you're going to find the evidence that you're looking for um I I think we we'll know soon enough we we'll know soon enough if Bitcoin cools off into the summer which it very well could we we've seen gold breakout just like it did in mid 2019 we've seen eth Bitcoin break down just like it did in mid 20 M mid 2019 all Bitcoin pairs still haven't broken down yet but if it cools off into the summer then it just seems like it's the same thing as last cycle it's just that the the midcycle top was nine months later about about n nine months later if on the other hand after the having Bitcoin just accelerates to the upside once again then I will have to uh I will probably say that there's more Merit to the idea of of a left translated top but that's what I'm looking at right now and so to just revisit my prediction back in 2020 what would be the fair value of Bitcoin at the fourth having of 40 to 50k I find myself today seeing a $64,000 Bitcoin 4 days before the having and I I can't think I can't help but think to myself wow back then when I made that prediction I thought it was a lofty prediction that frankly was maybe not you know not that likely to come true because you know when Bitcoin is at 8K and and it really hadn't done anything for a couple of years I wasn't really that optimistic um of of you know exactly how accurate this prediction would be come to find out I was too conservative potentially right I was too conservative so it just goes to show how difficult these markets are to predict um four years ago price of Bitcoin was at 8K I said fourth having 40 to 50 instead we find ourselves at 64 and what's fascinating to me is that if we were at 40 to 50K I think it would you know a lot of people would think the the world's falling apart when in reality that would have been what the fair value sort of suggested it would be and that chart that chart that you see in that video is just this chart right here um these regression bands here so at the last taing we were at the fair value that's the other thing that why I said 40 to 50K back then because at every prior having Bitcoin was at the fair value so in no the fit to non-bubble data so in November 2012 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to non-bubble data in July of 2016 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to quote unquote non-bubble data in May of 2020 Bitcoin was at its fair value fit to again quote unquote non bubble data theoretically I should have updated this chart because it does I think need to get updated every cycle I haven't really done it yet if I did update it it would just shift it down very very slightly but right now according to this chart the fair value is around um 52k 52k but if you if you were to refit it based on this data over here it would actually probably put the fair value somewhere between 40 to 50K which is why I said back over here like we'll have to refit it um and and it'll be around 40 to 50K so we're above that level right now if on the other side of the having or something we see that level just know that that is is is what the um you know the regression band would have ultimately suggested for this part of the cycle so those are my thoughts going into the Bitcoin having we will see what happens uh as the having comes around it's only four days away and and we will do an update in maybe a month or so we'll see what happened you know after the having if we just contined to rally on into a left translated top or if it cools off like 2019 and and we just kind of come back down and and cool off until until the last rate cut arrives if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs

      "Hi, this is NFA live this should be a relatively exciting show for two reasons first of all we have the Bitcoin having coming up in just about a day and we also have a new guest with us today Max from because Bitcoin uh how you doing great thanks so much for having me Ben yeah and you started you started doing this a year or two ago is that right yeah probably about 18 months ago officially yep all right yeah so max is um I've known him basically since probably before he even started the YouTube channel or right around the time that he started it uh so make sure you guys go subscribe to him and Rob as well uh links to that are in the description below so make sure you guys check that out and we're just going to go through a lot of the different questions that I think would probably be on people's minds as we go into the having uh so let's just go ahead and jump in Rob we'll start with you on this one the having is tomorrow it's tomorrow we've been waiting forever here it is fourth having um and I'm guessing it's going to garnish some attention should be making some headlines different places I'm curious what what effects do you think the having will have on the larger crypto space um do you think it'll bring new eyes to the scene or are we still kind of just uh you know the same old same old people just kind of hanging out um do you think it'll it'll actually bring new new people to the space uh we saw a lot of new people come to the space last cycle sometime after the having um or do you think it'll be quiet for a while and do you see any narrative shifts after the Havoc that's a pretty loaded question first of all I would just like to say that Max has a great background I'm sure he got to the same place I did which is fivr and uh hopefully he didn't get ripped off but it looks great and uh I gotta tell you one of these days max we're gonna have to put that into an nft just me and you so yeah yes that is my old green screen but I'll be jumping in that green screen as soon as the uh as the Bitcoin hits 100K But to answer Ben's question which I think is is what uh everybody wants to really try to figure out is this Bitcoin having and I know like there's a lot of first of all that I still believe in the fouryear cycle some people say that it doesn't really register I still and some people will talk like Bob Lucas will say well it's just left translated and we're going to see a big blowoff top in 2024 which could very well happen but I still think that the narrative around it and there's still a lot of people say well there's Mass adoption coming and it's already here I still think it's I mean I don't think that we're at the same level like we should be and what we could be in like 2028 or 2032 or you know time comes up but Ben if you get to show my my screen real quick because everyone wants to know like well the Bitcoin having and you did a great I I watched your your video Ben about uh uh the ethereum evaluation ethereum ethereum valuation of Bitcoin about how you know Bitcoin dominance is going up and how it's wreaking havoc and it's true it is right now I know people will will also talk about you know like hey well you know these things happen leading up to the having but if we take a look back this is from Smart Valor it's a good website and if we take a look they did all the work for him which is great this is how Bitcoin behav in the year leading up to each having because we had one of course in 2012 2016 then 2020 and I know people will say well there's always a dip there's always this massive dip before the having and there could be I mean we saw one pretty massive one in 2020 but of course there's a reason for that and and we could either say like it's because of the of the almighty Corona virus or it was something else but yeah there was a dip in 2016 but again just take a look at this so with having with the having one in 2012 the year leading up to the having it went up to 385 per. and the year after of course because we always see alltime highs the year after so far it went up 5,000% having two in 2016 leading up to it 142% now there's dips along the way and we're seeing that right now but then a year after that in 2017 2 84% in 2020 even though there was a turbulent year like we talked about it was still up 17% for the year getting into that having in May I think it was May 12 2020 and then it went up almost five almost 600% the year after that and we can see here that that yeah same thing happened the year leading up to to the having on November 208th 2012 this is what Bitcoin was 250 and then of course we come up and then you can see right here that yes there is a a drop before that and then it comes up and there's a drop before but it's like the same thing as like a bull market so we're seeing the same thing kind of Replay I know it's a funny thing because like Ben you'll say like uh you say hey I I I told you that the Bitcoin ethereum evaluation was going to start to start to lose momentum or actually bleed away to ethereum and then people were going to blame a Black Swan event and they never would have saw it coming but here we are and again same thing happens here 2015 a year going into it yes it's not a straight line but we kind of I mean really rallied into it there's you know dips along the way but I mean it's going in that right direction and then of course 2019 to 2020 we started at 7325 we had it kind of flat and then we saw the almighty Corona virus right here but then we rallied into it so I still feel like the same thing's gonna Happ happen that's just how I see things and I'm I'm feeling pretty good about this having so far but the big question is and and we we'll talk about this later is what's the macro is there going to be quantitative easing or more quantitative Tiding are they actually going to cut rates are we going to have the liquidity that we absolutely need which we had beforehand even though we're in quantitative uh tightening right now I mean we still rallied pretty well but can we get that liquidity back in the market and that's I think that's the big question on top of the fact of are we going to see World War II so yeah that's where I got yeah it's interesting because you know at some point you would think we would need to make the shift from quantitative tightening to quantity to quantitative easing but what needs to trigger that shift is the is the is the thing that I I think we're kind of wrestling with um someone asked where a guy was I I should have mentioned that he's he's in Dubai and I mean there's obviously a lot of stuff going on right there going on right now there with the conference and um everything so he wasn't able to make it this week um so um Max I I'll put the same question to you I mean like what are your thoughts here on the Bitcoin having um is this just kind of the same old thing that we've seen before and everyone's trying to over complicate it uh do you see any kind of shifts coming after after the having what are your thoughts yeah I I would agree with the with the last part I think that a majority of people and it's very easy to do this I I tend to do it all the time is to sort of chronically over complicate something that has for over a decade now been a pretty reliable uh we'll just we'll call it a risk on event and in the simplest of terms all you need to do is you know pull up your trading view chart and Mark out every single Bitcoin having right you need at this point you know you need to draw four vertical lines whenever a Bitcoin having has occurred look at the the price action that has basically come almost immediately following so um you know I I try to look at this thing from Every Which angle you know I look at it from the side I look at it up side down I you know I try to include the macro and and fed policy in all of my decisionmaking but um you know the truth of the matter is this is a very unique time to be in the markets right Bitcoin is now on the global stage in my opinion for the first time um there is you know new on-ramps into crypto you know specifically being these you know nine ETFs um and it is you know there's more regulatory Clarity the accounting standards have shift did in a positive light and are working to you know become more friendly for corporations and big money to actually onboard into this digital commodity if they choose to do so um but again like Rob had mentioned and Ben like you commented on there also are some macro headwinds which can only be ignored for so long unfortunately I am of the belief that we do still have some time I believe we're maybe on borrowed time some people probably don't like to hear that but but I do believe that there is this this unique pocket of time where it's all coming together and we can really see risk perform um positively of course I don't have to tell you guys this and I probably don't have to tell the audience this but historically during a Fed pause until something has quote unquote kind of broken and we see Unemployment uh you know trending above 4% and the FED actually has to step in and begin easing through you know interest rate cuts and other measures um we can actually see risk you know being stocks and now crypto performed tremendously well and you know going back to you know to the last cycle you know we actually kind of went through a little mini fed cycle here and you know 2018 2019 and 2020 um you know where Bitcoin actually the floor kind of gave out we dropped to about 3K and then we had that famous rally into June of 2019 when we topped um you know there was actually hikes going into that and then of course right as Bitcoin basically topped in June of 2019 the FED began to actually cut rates um more or less right after that and it did dramatically affect Bitcoin some will say you know it was a reflexivity and you know we had to you know we we sprung hard off of that local floor so you know of course the market corrects to the downside some will say it's covid some will say it was in the charts the whole time some will say it's not I don't know you know nobody knows whether it would have happened with Co or or without um but again I don't think that this time really is that much different I think that every cycle has some distinct differences from from a previous one I mean for example last cycle we had a double top we haven't had a true double top before we have had a cycle like the 2013 one where we had you know two pronounced Peaks but a true double top had never happened before and additionally in the bare Market we had never spent as much time below the 200 WEA as we just did coming out of this most recent bear so there are you know of course Very recognizable and notable differences of every cycle but you to answer the question Point Blank I don't think that this time is much different and I I'm trying my best to not overthink it um and say you know what there is no reason for the FED to intervene at this point we're trending in that direction and we are on borrowed time there is a Day of Reckoning coming but I do believe at the earliest it's probably sometime in Q4 we have the having you know in less than two days and I do believe that there's plenty of room for risk to run in the short to Middle term maybe going out six months okay yeah no I mean it's great to get you guys opinions um and the market has been on an absolute tear I mean essentially after since October right I mean it was pretty boring summer last year but then since October uh the market has basically just been up only up until the last few weeks but um you know the next thing I'd like to talk about is of course Rob's absolutely favorite topic and it's of course Bitcoin dominance um and you know I you know you guys know My Views but I always like to get other other views because you know I'm I it's it's a good idea not to live in an echo chamber so Bitcoin dominance has once again broken a new highs I I we saw 57% actually it came really really quickly really quickly you know that that move to 57% it's kind of cooled off back you know it's back down to like the 55 like 55 and a half or so so it has cooled off quite a bit since that rally up to 57% uh so uh Max I'll start with you first on this one do you think it's going to keep going up after the having um you know it was it it was going up into the spot ETF and then it kind of waned a little bit following the spot ETF but then it just kind of picked right back up so what do you think is gonna happen this time and and this kind of goes to the whole like the last question as well like will there be a narrative shift and what people are focused on will they will they start focusing on more things besides you know sticking with Bitcoin um do you see you know what are your thoughts on that Max well first I have to give you a compliment Ben because you were one of the few people that with a big following publicly called Bitcoin dominance rallying to this point I didn't expect it to get up to I think it topped at what 57 recently or wherever did you you deserve a lot of credit for that well I'm known for riding Trends too long see well we'll see right nobody knows besides the market right like you know we we all have our our inclinations but uh you deserve a lot of credit because I remember months and months AG I don't it was probably six months ago plus we did a space together or you came on on my my channel because Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance was significantly lower and eth BTC was significantly higher and much has changed since then so kudos to you where do I think it goes from here so I think that Bitcoin dominance is in the process of we'll call it distribution okay I believe believe that the meat of the move is over um but that does not preclude it from going a little bit higher than here maybe maybe 60% that's not my base case but you know let's let's look left on the chart and you know use that to you know maybe forecast what could happen next so ignoring the you know whether this is a left translated cycle or an expedited cycle let's look at it contextually for where Bitcoin is at um you know from from a a p perspective right so Bitcoin actually has gone on to get above the previous cycle all-time high of 69k so most comparably again ignoring everything else but just pure levels on the chart pure you know where was the cycle High where was the cycle low you could probably compare Bitcoin right now to like December of 2020 okay if we just ignore everything else and say okay Bitcoin in December of 2020 went on to sweep the previous cycle all-time high of 197 it paused there for what maybe a month or or something like that it was chopping around altcoins got destroyed during that time right Bitcoin uncertainty like you always preach Ben uh when Bitcoin is uncertain alts get absolutely eviscerated and we are seeing that once again right so um again comparing this period of time to December of 2020 there is turbulence under the previous cycle all-time high which is not uncommon we saw that again last cycle and then also two cycles ago it seems to be sort of the same thing happening again what did we see in December of 2020 well what we saw was Bitcoin dominance basically put in a deviation or bull trap High where on when Bitcoin finally decided it was time to push through with conviction above the previous cycle all-time high of 197 you saw Bitcoin dominance put in an explosive move which ultimately ended up being sort of a bull trap you know for for the Bitcoin Maxis um so I I think it's possible we are seeing that Devi that deviation high right now only time will tell um I do have hedges in place you know like I'm I'm holding some Bitcoin l2s like STX and some Bitcoin ordinals and things like that that I think would be beneficiaries of you know Bitcoin dominance continued rally maybe above 60% um but of course you know I I really I am of the belief that contextually with Bitcoin chopping under the previous cycle all-time high seeing similar signs of Bitcoin dominance putting in you know this this last explosive push I do believe that over the next six months or so it would probably makes sense to see Bitcoin dominance Trend down dramatically and additionally and and I don't mean to you know bring this up because I don't know if this is on the agenda today exactly I imagine that that would translate to eth BTC finding a bottom sooner rather than later but that doesn't again preclude it from going down a little bit more and only time will tell yeah no I mean it's great and I mean I I I think it's always worthwhile to hear these other views because um you know no one really knows right I mean you know no one really knows and you know one thing that I've wrestled with a lot before and I've seen other people do this too is like you know just because someone gets something right doesn't mean they're going to be right they're going to keep being right right and also just because someone gets something wrong doesn't mean they're GNA be keep being wrong I mean you know markets change no one knows what's going to happen and I I I could see eth Bitcoin carving out a bottom this summer um that's kind of my base case I could see that actually happening so we'll see if that happens Rob what are your thoughts I mean I know you're you're more of a you're more of a Bitcoin Maxi yourself right Bitcoin dominance to 100% I yes exactly go ahead Ben what was your question I'm just kidding I'm just kidding what what are your thoughts here on on on dominance do you think it's uh you think we're getting pretty close to the uh to the top well first of all let me just say that I I I was like listening to to Max especially on like the Twitter spaces and things like that he's very smooth in his delivery and very smart and and what he talks about so I gotta tell you it's good to hear like different sets of opinions it's great to have a Max here so to talk about I mean Bitcoin dominance I got to tell you like when you were talking the 60% I'm like yeah you know I can kind of see it you know I was I was I was under the assumption like well you know it always kind of comes back that way right something happens there's something that happens in the market a Black Swan event or you know something that's just that kind of has disruption and then people get scared and they're they're like okay I'm risk on but not that risk on to go into like you know Pepe coin I'm gonna go into the safest asset in the most volatile industry which would be Bitcoin and I I could see that for sure but then like there's a narrative that that people are always talking about especially in in in the crypto space being the Bitcoin maxos are going to say Bitcoin only right but there are narratives that are out there one of those is dpin Right centralized physical infrastructure Network the other one are dexes because we see what's going on with the centralized exchanges getting sued getting their pants sued off by the SEC and then leaving of course so we have to have dexes and then of course there's another big one which is web 3 so we talk about that but there's one that I feel is on an undertone and Max alluded to it when he was talking about it when he talked about runes and he talked about ordinals and he talked about things like stacks and l2s and I think what's gonna really push Bitcoin dominance up I know Ben loves this part too is uh the the l2s or even l1s that are going to be built on bitcoin Ben if you just throw this this chart up I always talk about this website it's l2. watch so imagine this and I and and and even like Adam back has talked about this how he's talked about he hates the fact that everybody's building off of Bitcoin people should just build on bitcoin because he says it's like it's it's like the tcpip layer for for the internet so why can't they just build on the most the safest most secured Network or computerized Network ever built in the entire world and he was right so when I take a look at these these l2s that are coming out and they're all new so you I to understand like this some most of these are trash let's just let's just call it SP Spade but like when we talk about things that are coming out that are actually doing pretty good like a Stax who's been around for quite some time I can really see things actually happening for sure and then like I just dropped a a video on my second Channel where I talked about core core is a top uh 50 well it's 56 now but it's essentially an L1 L2 type of uh uh token which is built right on top of Bitcoin using delegated proof of work and delegated proof of stake together to actually make dexes nfts and a whole host of things you can only do with smart contracts so when I see stuff like this happening I'm like why can't we take away the nonsense that's going on over in ethereum world and they're massive gas fees like just like with with core and stacks right now if you use it or the things that are being built on top of it they're just going through their Satoshi initiative it's super cheap and it's super fast so for me to see that Bitcoin dominance could go up why couldn't it especially with the different institutions that are here and how they've been drilled into it now they can say oh there's something else I can do and also smart I see it could actually go above 60% but again I'm not always right no I mean I I've it's possible it's certainly possible um I think the answer is going to probably come in the next few weeks because you know there's two prior examples where we had these kind of these like closes below the 8we ese 2021 and 2019 and in 2021 after it happened Bitcoin got a rally eth Bitcoin went up but in 2019 when Bitcoin got that rally eth Bitcoin went down so I think if we see Bitcoin get some type of relief I don't know maybe sometime after the having into may I I don't know exactly when it would be but whenever that comes whatever happens to eth bitcoin should be very telling about where we are in the cycle so I I'm going to be focused a lot on that um over the next few weeks but we will see um next question Rob I'm GNA start with you on this one to rotate and you know I remember last year you saying something like this um and and you ended up being correct it was basically you know sell and man go away um like I mean no one's D Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear since October I mean you know I mean it was basically like 25 to 30k not even that long ago um and I I think sometimes we forget just how quickly it has moved so I'm curious like do you think it's going to be similar to last summer where we just get the market gets boring before maybe moving up again like later in the year or something you think it's just going to get boring for a few months um do you think or on the other hand do you think everyone's gonna get think it's boring and then we just get another you know face what's it called like a face melting Rally or something that's exactly face yeah I mean like so so what are your thoughts going into the summer because I mean again I know last summer you you thought it was going to be boring do you think it's going to be boring again this summer or you think it's going to be different Matt well first of all I I hope so I I really do because everybody who's in the chat right now answer a question for me uh tell me if you think that you've accumulated enough where you're like you know what I've bought plenty of Bitcoin and I just cannot handle any more bags I just I don't want to buy anymore especially if it goes down and gets cheaper just let me know in the comment section because it seems like when these types of things Ben when you say things are boring this is great because this is when people who like the dollar cost average is fantastic or if you're Dynamic DCA is things go down which I think where we at the risk levels now 0.6 0.59 somewhere around there a little yeah I think a little above 0 six so like if we're in this place we're like well I mean for me this is a good time to just accumulate a little bit but as we start to like if it goes sideways well great I have more time to bring things in but then if you if you want to talk about selling May and go away there's this great chart on this website that I steal from constantly and if you just take a look because it's it's yeah it's a nice website it's very nice I think there's a sale going on until like tomorrow and then it goes away so but if if you say sell in May and go away it it actually works out pretty well I mean historically speaking but then if you really want to break it down because people say but Rob you don't get it because this is the having year so it's all it doesn't really it count well if you take a look at it I mean if you sold at the end of May of 2020 I mean you had a 30% increase on January a couple of drops there 34 and 10% and then you're down here and you just kind of stay away until October and then you buy in and then October rallies November rallies and December rallies that's not bad I mean I'll take that year right and if we go back to 2016 I mean it's the same type of thing if I want to sell in May okay well June's gonna go up but I have red red I take I stay away September as well and I I buy back in October November December I'm doing pretty good so I still think it can work out all right the thing that you have to understand though and one more thing is is this there's a presidential election I think this is going to be pretty tumultuous as we get into it so there was this piece from hbk's wealth and it talked about the presidential election years versus the non-election as far as returns and this is just taking a look at the S&P 500 you can see that in the presidential election years which this is that year it sends to like kind of peek off around March April and then just kind of fall away until we get into junisha may go away October is here you buy back in and then we have a nice little rally of course drop here and then off we go but 10% for that year is not too bad now does that mean that I'm going to sell everything no no I'm just telling you these are just the data points that we can say take a look at me personally I'm just here to accumulate and uh get into some early round type of cryptos that could either make a lot of money or go to zero one of those two will always happen yeah I was looking at this um this is uh this is the S&P 500 in 2024 compared to the average of all election years right I mean so you can see like it has come down a lot recently but it also went up a lot too like way more than it does on average so there's just been a lot more volatility this cycle than I think we've seen in a lot of Prior Cycles um but yeah I I thought that was interesting and that chart sort of reminded me of that uh Max what are your thoughts here I mean I know earlier you said you expected uh risk to do pretty well um over the next six months but you know even with that do you think that the market could cool off before that phase or do you think it's not going to really get much of a breather or do you think the Breather is almost over yeah that's it's a it's a great question of course we're all from relatively familiar with the uh maybe cliche but overused but also kind of accurate saying of sell and may go away um one thing that I've been preaching for a while going back to I mean even I would say Q4 of last year is that I was seeing signs early on of a maybe expedited cycle for crypto um and it's probably off of of you know the back of this this fed paw and there isn't quite as much in my opinion economic deterioration as a lot had thought myself included and we're in this you know kind of Goldilocks window where risk can rally really unencumbered um you know so so do I think that selling may go away will come to fruition I I would think that worst case in my opinion from what I'm seeing right now and again of course subject to change it's just one man on the internet's opinion I think that similarly to how this cycle for crypto is being a little bit front Rand and we've actually seen for the first time a Bitcoin all-time high before a having which of course had never happened before um I also think it's possible that selling may go away is being front ran a little bit and we're seeing that right now with this April correction so similarly to Rob I am not I am not in the camp of you know drisking or selling spot because again like I mentioned in you know during our first question here if you just draw four vertical lines on your trading View and Mark out every Bitcoin having look what typically happens in the six to nine months following Additionally you know for a lot of us that have been slowly you know and thoroughly meticulously dcing into our digital digital assets and our unregistered Securities over the past year you know a lot of us have tax consequences for selling right now and I'm I'm not really interested in incurring any uh you know tax consequences trying to reposition because May perhaps is a little bit choppy so in my opinion you know and again going back you know the past 18 months for Bitcoin we haven't seen more than a 22% correction on bitcoin so from our local high recently take it down 22 to 25% maybe you get 57 56 worst case that's not enough for me to incur you know a taxable event to try to reposition so uh maybe it happens maybe it doesn't but for me ultimately it doesn't make a big difference because the having is in a couple days um and typically what happens after a having is months and months of prosperity and hopefully price discovery yeah no it's a fair point I mean I think like all the corrections that we've had by Bitcoin for the entire bull market have only been about 20 to 22% yeah we've already seen it go down about what 18% or so um so that I think that'll be the the area I mean if we get down there see if it turns around and if it does maybe the time's not different you know but yeah what do you think Ben do you think selling May and go away will come to ahead um I think now I mean so I so we went into the 7 to point8 risb in March so that I think was the time to to drisk some kind of like during the spot ETF um at this point it's kind of like when we went back to 39K after the spot ETF um we then it was it was a 22% drop and then we just rallied after it right and and so I was like you know this could be our preh having year dip and then the rally just continued and so now it's kind of the same thing it's like you know the the area to do it if you were convinced about it would have been in in March you know um when gold broke out because that's actually in 2019 when Bitcoin topped was when gold broke out um so I think that would have been the time to do it now I do think there is a risk of if you've waited if you've waited till this point and now bitcoin's down 20% we did see both in after the 20209 or the 2019 top and the 2021 top the first weekly close bow of the 8we SMA we then had a rally back up you know to the we right which is around 67k we actually went slightly above it in both cases so I think what what's more important is not exactly what happens here at the range lows but it's what happens whenever we get a relief move does it sustain or does it just put in a lower high I think that is kind of the thing to look for because back in after the spot ETF it wasn't a lower high we just you know had another face ripping rally fire um the the reason why I am more cautious on this one than than the last one is because eth Bitcoin has now broken down and gold is broken out which both of those events marked the 2019 local top and it wasn't the market cycle top and this kind of goes back to what Rob was saying you know there is this idea of a left translated peak in 2024 and I can sort of like I'm like 30% maybe 40% aware of that like you know thinking hey this is this could actually happen you know if if we were to Rally into the summer to higher prices without cooling off then I would be very more so convinced of a left translated Peak but what if what if if you think about what happened after the 2019 top after gold broke out and after e Bitcoin broke down Bitcoin went into a six to n month bare Market in fact now imagine you get that after the having and everyone thinks the cycle is over by the end of 2024 because it just hasn't done anything since the having and then we just get another move in 2025 and then the cycle Peaks when it always does and once again everyone over complicated it you know like there is a chance that that that happens um so I would I think I would just watch to see what happens whenever we get any type of relief does it form into a lower high or does it lead to a higher high and then you probably have your answer to whether it's a left translit cycle or not at that point I can see absolutely yeah and again even in 2019 it was it was just a local top we bled for a while we actually bled back to the 100 we SMA um and then and then we started to go back back up and then we had the we had the pandemic crash but if you ignore that it was just sort of a bleed after all Bitcoin pairs broke down and then and then once we got that back you know we start to go back up those are my and and by the way I mean you've always said this going back when you know before I started my business and I was watching all of your videos you know years ago Ben you used to always say something kind of along the lines of you know the longer it takes you know the higher will ultimately go something along those lines and you know I think a uh this idea of a prolonged sort of midcycle Correction freaks a lot of people out because everybody wants to be rich overnight myself included right of course i' I'd love for us to just go straight up in a straight line and I hope that we do but ultimately I don't think it would be a death sentence for Bitcoin to kind of reestablish value between 55 and 75k for even a full quarter um you know I think ultimately would probably lead to more constructive uh price action to the upside in the long run but people you know their patients will be tested no question yeah yeah I mean I think the the the thing to look for in the cycle I think is is the Bitcoin dominance I I really do think it's the key for the cryptoverse and I think I think that dominance will Top before Bitcoin Falls below the 20we SMA that's my guess is that it's going to top before Bitcoin Falls below it and I think between now and then Bitcoin gets occasional rallies that just take off Bitcoin pairs even lower is my guess um so that's why I just say like you know if you want exposure to crypto Bitcoin I mean you know Bitcoin is is a relatively safe bet if you want to take on more risk there's obviously the altcoin market there's the full DJ mcoin Market um but you have to be careful with those and I I I think the winning strategy with the altcoin market and and even if you are in the riskier memec coin stuff is just to remember like in five years that Meme coin is probably not going to exist No One's Gonna care about it because they're going to be worried about the next stage of mean points right so the way the way to navigate it is it's okay to have exposure to various parts if you want to take more risk but just occasionally convert it back to bitcoin if you make a lot of money right because at least you know you then know hey Bitcoin is still going to be around in 10 years I don't know if this random meme coin is Ben how could you say that how dare you my a meme coins oh my I think I've converted most of my audience to bitcoin Maxis at this point but I will say by the time I convince the last person to be a Bitcoin Maxi that's when the dominance tops out and we go back the other way I don't think we're that far away I think maybe this summer dominance tops out we'll see though but you are correct like what anybody out there like if we're being completely honest Would You Bet Your Life that Your Meme coin or your altcoin is going to be around in 50 years would You Bet Your Life on it I probably would not would I bet my life I mean it's an extreme example right would I bet my life or something valuable that Bitcoin will be around bet your would you bet all your money on it or something right that's much more friendly right so and I would for Bitcoin I have a high degree of confidence and that's why your strategy ultimately it's conservative you know relative to a lot of other people that you know talk about crypto publicly but it is ultimately a long-term winning strategy and people need to recognize that profits from altcoins ultimately do have to flow back into Bitcoin that is the sustainable strategy for sure yeah I mean I think Rob I think Rob was talking about this what last week on NFA live we were talking about like what do you do when you get an airdrop and I think what was your strategy like just 50% you take profits on it right away 50% back to bitcoin or USD and then you let there oh no no it was you let let it go up 2X or something or if it goes up 2x then you sell 50% was that what you said yeah I I call it well two things I call it the half and half method so you get into meme coins or something crazy and then let's say you put it you know 100 bucks in and then it goes $200 so then you sell half immediately and you put the other hundred bucks let it ride because that's house money then when it doubles or triples or or quadruples then you take half again or you take two or three or 4X what do you want to do and then you let the ride and you do that until there's no more riding and it just goes away and then you're like well okay I I did 8X but it went to zero so I don't feel so bad because a lot of people just let it go all the way up and all the way down but if you just play with house money there's a reason why like like I I can see people in the in the chats going well this sucks because you know now we're gonna sideways and you know this isn't what I want to be there's a reason why all three of us are pretty much just like on all of our videos on all of our Twitter spaces we're pretty much the same person whether it goes massively up or way way down me's a little bit of excitement but it's because we der risked enough to like well if this happens then we do this if this happens we do that and I think that's where people should would want to be as opposed to just going okay I sold my kidney I hope this memec coin goes up it's one of those things have a plan no matter what and then enjoy your life don't stress about it right I mean have a plan like you know if Bitcoin goes to 50K or even lower so what have a plan if it goes up have a plan I mean it I I think you know I used to navigate crypto without without thinking about like what do I do if this happens I only would navigate it based on one particular outcome I never hedge myself but once I started hedging My Views then it makes things easier you know you're like all right well this is what I think but if I'm wrong I don't want to be you know completely left out of whatever that next trend is um and when I when I get air drops um well I don't I don't really get air drops anymore because I'm not really that active in in the space but when I did when I used to get air drops my strategy was immediately convert half of it to bitcoin at least half to bitcoin and then let whatever else ride because like half the time they would just go to zero anyways um so at least you get some of that value out in inss um why don't we goe and move on because we do have two more questions and then I'd also like to get to audience questions at the end if you post your question now I probably won't see it so maybe wait like 10 minutes and then post it um this is an interesting question and I to be completely honest most people aren't going to care but gold is is one of these things where like it doesn't do anything for like 10 years you know and like if you think about this entire bitcoin's like like it's entire history essentially since 2009 gold has essentially gone nowhere in that in that entire phase but we just saw gold break to new all-time highs and it seems to be a somewhat explosive rally so I'm curious about what your thoughts are on gold um I I often think that people who like gold are are more alike to people who like Bitcoin than they would care to admit I think the main difference is the generation that we are right so if I were born one or two generations ago I probably would have been really into gold you know but because I'm born into more of the digital age I'm more into Bitcoin so I think we're more alike than different um so I'm curious like what your thoughts are on gold here it is now 2300 2400 um max where do you you know do you think that uh this is going to continue I me Silver is also not too far behind it in its own move um and I guess the other question is like why do you think gold is rallying so that's probably the bigger question is is why do you think it's rallying rather than like what do you think it's going to go to sure yeah the gold strength is um pronounced it's very impressive um and and I would say I mean why do people buy gold historically right it's sound money it was sound money before Bitcoin it was a store of value when you know our our parents generation was nervous about the state of the world they would you know convert their into gold and uh you know a lot of it is more of a um it's a mental thing it's a it's a mental insulation it's not like if your country was invaded you're going to put you know 500 pounds of gold on your back and somehow travel to another country right but it's a it's a peace of mind thing you know and you know again historically it is you know a sound currency uh there is a scarcity aspect to it there's a lot of commonality and overlap between gold and Bitcoin and I think everything you mentioned Ben is correct um I would say that my bias on gold um really stems more on my perspective and my my forecast on where I think dxy is headed and similarly where I think Bitcoin is headed I've already shared my opinion on where I think Bitcoin is going we have the Bitcoin having just around the corner um I expect Bitcoin to you Trend upwards aggressively over the next six to nine months subsequently I do believe that dxy is forming a sort of distribute you know a distribution here I do anticipate dxy topping very soon and again if you just overlay gold with dxy on a weekly chart you can see that there is a pretty prominent negative correlation between dxy and gold so I don't think we're I'm not of the opinion that we're going to see a decoupling where there's suddenly a a prolonged period of a positive correlation where gold rallies and dxy rallies I think that one of them is lying so either gold is lying or dxy is lying I think that gold is leading and going to see dxy of course sort of reclaim that negative correlation and begin to take a dive over the next quarter so um I do expect gold to continue upwards and I think it's probably off the back of the you know dxy weakening okay yeah fair enough um it has it has been really strong you know and I I can't help but look at it I'm like wow you have like a 10-year base I the bigger the base the more explosive the rally and for I mean for I know like all the crypto you know Deens are like you know it's up what like 10% or something and like people are like you know like 10% is like a minute candle on a meme coin right but for gold you know for an asset that's that high market cap like that is a big move in a really short period of time and so like that's why it it it means something Rob what are your thoughts here um are you are you are you watching this gold move I'm not watch I mean but I own it I own gold and silver and I I think and I don't I never UND and we talk about this many times I never understood why the old maximalists and this and the precious metal maximalists hate Bitcoin so much because like you said we're trying to all do the same thing we're trying to get out of the Matrix which is relying on paper Fiat and it just seems like I there's there's that one gold bug guy that is what we all talk about for some god- awful reason but in reality I think for the majority of people that are into precious metals I think they can see the value behind it and of of of Bitcoin itself and like I I like I never understood with this guy like why don't we have a debate between that guy and like Mike Maloney Mike Maloney is huge into gold he's put out a great series on precious medals and he's he likes Bitcoin as well so like when I take a look at this I I think you know why why not own why not old gold why not diversify like you know uh we've got I diversify not just in the crypto but the stocks precious metals and and real estate and I think everybody should do the you know kind of do the same thing but to talk about why gold went up so much let me I I don't know but how did gold do in 2022 was there any kind of rally during that time I mean it it it it still mostly stayed below the high I don't really think it did that well um it's only recently really started to show strength I mean I can I can pull it up and see but 2022 was kind of split it rallied in the first half of the year and then didn't really do too much and actually corrected a little bit looks like yeah I mean it looks like it topped in March of 2022 and then basically just went down yeah till November and then it rallied again into December kind of there there's a theory going around about why Gold's rallying so much it's because the Nations that are going to war they are trying they're fearful of us sanctions so how do how do you get away get around those sanctions well you stockpile Alternatives and one of those would be of course gold so people are talking about how Iran could be could have stockpiled after the Damascus situation and the and the bombing and the reason why I ask about 2022 is because for the Ukraine Invasion I think was February 2022 and the same type of thing was being said about Russia stockpiling gold at the same time so I can see I can kind of see that that valuation I don't know why they don't just use Bitcoin it's a heck of a lot easier to transfer and zip around value but that's where we're at yeah I always like I always think those posts by the gold bugs are so disingenuous because I mean like I I own both like I own Bitcoin and gold but like if you go to trading View and you look at the Bitcoin or you look at the Gold valuation against Bitcoin it's down so much since Bitcoin launched that it rounds it to negative 100% like like that's how far the valuation of gold has fallen against Bitcoin since Bitcoin has been around so again like it's not it's just look I mean the the Bitcoin valuation as far exceeded gold for a long time um I mean my guess is over the next 20 years Bitcoin will still outperform gold you know maybe in the short term gold could outperform uh Bitcoin but and I I mean I guess it has been since March right ever since gold broke out Gold's been doing better than even the S&P 500 even the NASDAQ um it's been having my view is that I I I think that gold is breaking out because it senses that um rate cuts are coming sooner than the market is potentially thinking and so that's kind of why I think I I think it's sort of sniffing something out just like it did in 2019 and and um but we'll see I mean you know we'll see if it if it plays out in the same way last question and I mean I you know this is more so geared towards Max um because I mean Rob is I mean you know you've been around here forever we' probably even asked this question you before yeah but I mean if you want to take it if you want to answer you can Max Max yeah so since you're new here um why did you start your YouTube channel I mean like what what was your motivation what are you helping to accomplish with it uh what brings you here well Ben you you actually played a big role in in bringing me here I was a very early follower of yours actually before you even had your website I bought your Google sheet way back in the day and I'm still locked into my original price thank you very much because I got in early pays to get in early um you know I I learned a lot from you in the very beginning and I went through last cycle and you know Ben and and Rob also this you know this is a compliment to both of you guys amongst a sea of grifters and thieves and people looking to prey on unsuspecting retail you know guys like yourselves you you conducted yourselves in a manner that you know I mean I can't even imagine how many millions of dollars you guys turn down from shill deals and you know crap like that and you know I I wanted to in the beginning play my you know play my part in that I felt as though I had opinions that you know um I could share something to offer I have you know I have an ability to lead I have you know an ability to organize a team um and I wanted to play my my part my equal share in the sort of collective hive mind of you know CT and and YouTube and help educate that's sort of the underpinning of of what I'm doing is I like to teach I like to collaborate and you know making money certainly feels nice right but there's a certain there's a certain sense of fulfillment that I personally get out of somebody messaging me saying hey because of what you said it made a difference in my life and something clicked for me and that feels really good and you know I I started because Bitcoin and it was it's a small Channel still um we're growing quickly certainly which of course if you go to Ben's beautiful website and you overlay social media growth with uh you know the price of Bitcoin you can see why I'm starting to grow quicker it's it's I'm doing the same thing I was doing all bare Market it's just suddenly more people care about crypto so um you know I am a i a result of good times and I pray that they continue on because of course it's you know a nice Tailwind for for my young business but yeah I mean really to answer the question Point Blank I love to teach I love to to collaborate and I love to debate you know like I have a differing opinion than you know you guys for some things and there's some overlap but that's what makes a market beautiful is that you can think one thing I can think another and we can come together and just talk about it politely and nobody knows what's going to happen right like we can't I have my hunch I have conviction just like you guys do but Bitcoin dominance could go to 90% And you know even over flip it and put that on on Twitter don't do that don't do that or or it could literally nuke down to 10% we could have like the crypto equivalent of the NASDAQ bubble between 1995 and 2000 where altcoins bubble like people you know can't imagine everybody's thrown money at altcoins speculating anything that's crypto and then 99 out of 100 of them don't exist in a couple years you know so who who knows what's going to happen but yeah I love to to collaborate and teach and debate and uh generally it's it's just a passion of mine how many subscribers are you guys at now like 13 14k or something yes on YouTube somewhere in between there yeah well there's 3,600 people watching so if everyone here goes and clicks the link in the description below and goes over to Max's Channel and subscribes then uh I I'm sure he would appreciate that and I think he deserves that he's been they've been putting out they it's not just Max by the way I mean it's a team of people um so go check that out you guys do like daily live streams right we Yeah we actually have a show coming up at uh 10:00 a.m. eastern time we do a Daily Show we've got a panel of Five Guys we're all just Traders wrap this one up then if you got it coming up in 10 minutes that's okay I got a big team they got it all right well before we before we end it here I I did want to take at least a couple of questions um and one of the questions I saw was um what is the best way to learn about crypto and to do your own research so I mean I don't know if they're talking about like from a fundamental perspective but I if someone were getting into crypto like like what do you guys use to do your research and I mean and maybe talk about like all the different tool or some at least some of the bigger tools that you guys have been using especially for all the different things that are happening in the cryptoverse there seems like there's a thousand different narratives that you could you know that you could follow and whoever wants to take that one is fine go ahead Max yeah um I would start on uh one of our three channels I think that's a really good place not to not to spew the obvious but um I would say I would say learn to do very basic ta right and understand Cycles like there's some very awesome free indicators out there like I mean you can even just look at like you know Ben has a a you he's kind of coined a very famous one he's combined a 20 week SMA and a 21 we EMA which has been sort of uh marketed as the bull market band for good reason right so you can determine when you know Bitcoin is trending upwards High time frame or trending down by just a simple you moving average band there's also things like the P Cycle top which I think people should keep an eye on which is again a free trading view indicator someone someone made it it's also on Ben's website there's also some some good onchain stuff like you know Bitcoin terminal price hoddle waves things like that I would as a beginner I would stay off the hourly time frame like literally just go daily time frame and above um and whenever you see Bitcoin down you know 50% from its its all-time high that's time to start paying attention to maybe consider entering the market but you know learn very very basic ta and and some of the more popular onchain indicators can really help you just DCA at the right time you know but stay off of the hourly time frames mainly the py cycle top just to give credit is uh was developed by Philip Swift um a while back and I the the idea was to predict the top with within 3 days and it did a really great job of doing that in the first uh the first 2021 Peak um and it actually happened I remember it happening and like no one really believed it you know um but I think it was retrofit right it was fit after yeah it was created in 2019 it was created in 2019 okay but it did it did get the first top in 2021 I feel like a lot of these like metrics that everyone created in 2019 uh it they called the first top but then most of them like didn't really call the second top because it was just sort of like a it was like a dead cat bounce that just somehow made it to New highs you know yeah um so yeah that was kind of an interesting one um Rob did you have anything to add just yeah just one thing Max makes all great points the thing I would say is that if you really knew you really really knew you have to understand that it's not how much you make it's how much you keep and the big thing is that you have to watch out for scams and things to watch out for and if you're gonna get into like hot storage wallets stuff like that there's a there's a video in the in the link of in the description of all my videos and it says you know things you the the big mistakes in crypto and it has like 20,000 views and of course it's the most important video I probably have ever put out because that's what people get screwed out and they get scammed out and if they watch that video they wouldn't happen to them another video I did when I'm gonna sell on my crypto has over 100,000 views so it just goes to show you like where the priorities are the priorities are make money but really the priority should be keep money someone's asking a um this the Market's not pricing it in right now but I did see like last night there's been a couple of times here where like there's at least some in investors like thinking about a rate hike um that is not like my base case at all like I think they're done I I think five and a half percent is the terminal rate for this cycle they might go higher next cycle uh but I I think five and a half percent at the top I'm not going to ask you if you think they're gonna hike again because I don't really think any of us think they're going to um if you do think that let me know but I guess my main question is what do you think would happen if they did hike again um because that be I mean that would talk about markets not pricing it in right I mean like I guess the the implication would be like if if the economy just accelerates into you know again and and there's not a cool down and we just keep on moving up uh what would a rate what would another rate hike do well what was real quick what was what is what has Jerome Powell said about fighting inflation do they say that they're on the right track or do they say like there's it's more more stubborn what he they've kind of like the progress has slowed a lot and I I think they've kind of specul that it it might influence their the number of rate Cuts this year because previously they had said three rate Cuts this year and I'm I'm wondering if they're starting to walk I mean now the market is pricing in only two rate cuts through April of 2025 so I my view is that you know I thought higher for longer but now that everyone else believes it I think I think it's going to go back the other way because once the market fully prices in no rate Cuts that's when people give up and you need to start having some rate cuts um but yeah I don't know I mean pal Po's basically said the same thing he said for the last three years if you know they're they're going to keep rates higher for longer until inflation's durably going back to 2% yeah I I think that 3% is is the new 2% truthfully I I I appreciate their narrative and their consistency and and how they haven't wavered on that and I think it's a great goal um but it seems like three is kind of a magnet actually a little above three um like you mentioned they are currently pricing in now it looks like you know our first 25 basis point cut on the uh September 18th meeting and then through April 2025 and and these percentages change all the time right uh you know we'll see what happens um you know potentially taking us down 50 basis points off of where we're currently at um let me answer your question what would happen if we got another 25 basis point hike because you know inflation decides it's going to rear its ugly head again and and start trending up above you know headline four 5% God forbid it's over I mean like we are going to absolutely nuke if we get another rate I'm gonna be as as clear as I can be if we get another rate hike markets are going to capitulate like that will be awful horrible for risk like sell all of your assets honestly like if that happens I'm not joking I think it'd be terrible I don't know if you guys agree with me but that would be horrible for markets but I don't think that's going to happen to be clear I think you could have the same thing happen if they just refuse to cut soon enough too because like it it you know like a tightening cycle is not just raising rates but it's also keeping rates too high for too long and the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and eight would have been in March um so we've already gone nine I think there's still you know there's still a window where talks about a soft Landing right it's so hard to thread that needle to a soft Landing because you have to stay high enough to make sure inflation doesn't come back in a second wave because if you don't and you get an inflation a secondary wave like the 70s you get a hard Landing but if you stay high for too long like let's say they stay at five and a half percent for another six months then you start to run the risk of of a deflationary crash right so that's why everyone sort of rolls their eyes about a soft Landing is because it's so difficult to thread that needle and I don't I do not envy their job I I do not envy their job because it's not and and they're also operating with long and variable lags like how can they know all the effects of prior monetary policy um so yeah it's it's a tough place for them to be and and we are oh sorry Rob go ahead no no go ahead Max I was going to say you know we are seeing some smaller economies in my opinion forecasting when our rate cuts are coming like we have seen the Czech Republic actually start to cut we've seen Poland cut um so it you know historically it's not perfect right but you are starting to see some of these smaller countries actually they they LED through the hik so they began to hike first they paused first and they've actually started to cut so I I do anticipate that you know in similar fashion to what has happened historically we will see the US begin to I guess cut rates hopefully uh later this year um but I do agree with you Ben like if they held rates where they're currently at through you know all of 2024 that would also put some pressure um on our economy and our markets but with that said like I don't know what you you guys think but I mean really the the final you know real dagger or Domino to fall is going to be of course unemployment creeping up above four four and a half percent do you guys think that if they just held rates where they're currently at all through 2024 um but we didn't see the labor market really deteriorate could financial markets hold up in that instance I mean if if the labor market doesn't deteriorate sure I just think that um I mean it seems like the unemployment rate is trending up um and the the problem with with that is that it doesn't tend to move in a linear fashion right it it goes slow and then it starts to accelerate at some point and we haven't reached the acceleration phase right so there's still a chance that we can avoid it but the longer they wait the the the riskier that's going to be I think I think there's a higher probability of a rate cut this summer than the market is giving credit for I don't think it has to happen this summer but I think the right thing to do is to cut at least 25 basis points uh this summer 50 basis points something like that just uh provide something you know are you thinking in the June meeting or July meeting I mean look last cycle I know that that the altcoin market was a lens into the consumer and I know that that when alts broke down against Bitcoin and when eth broke down against Bitcoin the FED basically cut one month later um and we we have seen eth fall against Bitcoin it had a weekly close below the June low we saw madic Bitcoin uh crash below it's June 2022 low we've seen adaa Bitcoin and Dot bit coin we've seen Litecoin Bitcoin and a Bitcoin I mean so many of these altcoins are are falling off their Bitcoin support levels and you can see it with the Bitcoin dominance so I think that the pricing out of all these rate Cuts is going to cause them to get priced in because the FED does not base their decisions on what our altcoins are doing right un they don't care what I what I what I find unfortunate is that a lot of the small like companies like Mom and Pop shops a lot of them are going out of business business right now because you know rates are going up and and and times are getting harder like inflation is so high so people just can't afford as much and but the FED has to do it because all of us Deens in the in the space can't help ourselves from bidding up jpegs you know and and and leading inflation uh to to where it was so I think that it's it's kind of a tough spot to be and the FED has to stay long enough to kind of break the animal spirits but if they do it too long then you then then you run the other issue of of a deflationary um unwind and that's not really fun either I know like people are like oh I'd love to go to the store and not spend as much money but if you if prices go down that's probably not good for risk assets terrible just yeah so everybody everybody who's watching the videos remember this when when you think like okay the Bitcoin Market or the crypto Market has to do this thing it has to do this thing because it's it's been the cycle that's always done this doesn't actually work like what we just talked about just how fragile the markets actually are and just to think how things have to really go in line before you realize that oh maybe I should have taken some profits when there was uh everything was overheated just it's just something to think about because I hate people who roundtrip and uh they really should again take some profits when everything gets too hot and and one thing just to mention about rate cuts and I mean you guys probably know this rate Cuts inherently are not bearish right it's it's the underpinning as to why they are cutting rates and you know if you actually on a granular level you go and you overlay the effective federal funds rate with you know the NASDAQ or S&P 500 markets actually tend to rally for like 30 to 60 days give or take following the First Rate cut until they wake up and they realize oh crap there's economic deterioration under the surface which is why they're cutting rates and then we see these major Corrections so I think whether the first 25 basis point comes in June or the end of July meeting or I guess hopefully September um that's probably your 30 to 60-day warning truthfully whenever it comes and I don't know when it will and what about no go ahead I was going to say you're right I mean like the rate Cuts inherently are are are bullish for risk assets if they're cutting for the right reasons in 2019 while Bitcoin topped out when rate Cuts arrived the S&P 500 kept going up and you know because the mark like the the economy was not in a recession right it wasn't going into a recession they were sort of like preliminary rate Cuts You could argue that Bitcoin is more tied to financial markets today traditional markets today than it was back then because of the spot ETF so maybe it would track the S&P 500 a bit closer than it did last cycle once rate Cuts arrive but the issue is why the FED is cutting are they cutting because they're trying to get ahead of something bad that's coming or are they cutting as a reactionary thing because they just saw a really bad labor market prance and that is is when they're not bullish like that's when rate cuts are be so it all depends on Max is right it all depends on why they're cutting and and I think that it's also risky to I I I do believe that there's just as much risk to the UPS side truthfully where you know assuming that they're going to cut because there is severe economic deterioration can also be you know a very harmful strategy long term because like you mentioned the first batch of rate cuts that we saw in 2019 um you know the S&P 500 rallied out of those cuts like 15% and then of course we had our Co nuke in March which took us below you know where that that first uh cut occurred right but you know again it's like you have to be very careful you kind of threading your own needle per se because just because they're cutting doesn't mean sell everything right because they could cut you know the labor market could be more resilient than anybody's expecting the S&P 500 could go up 50% over the next year and then something bad happens and you get a correction but that correction doesn't take you down to as low as the point in which the first cut happens so you just have to be a little bit careful truthfully you know you have to really understand why they're cutting and and it's a tough thing to do it's very tough I me with the S&P you know there there's been all sorts of like crises throughout all the decades but if you just pull up a chart over a 100 years I mean you know the the the overall trend is clear you know um the markets generally go up because the money supply yeah yeah you know why did prices of houses go up 40% because the supply of money went up 40 per. you know it's not it's not I it's not really that complicated so yeah no I mean I think like as always right like time in the market often beats time the market um because it's impossible to to actually time the market for under most circumstances and I think sometimes people get lucky with it and then assume that they're like a genius and can do it again and again and again um but the reality is that the market will humble us all at some point why don't we go ahead and wrap it up there um we we'll have NFA live back I guess next week next week I think it'll be on Rob's Channel um so we'll see you guys over there next week and again if you're not subscribed uh to to Max or Rob links for their channels are in the description

exactly when but I would go ahead and get it now if you want the subscription at the lower rate before we jump in I I would like to say thank you to everyone who is a subscriber here I like to kind of take a step back when I hit these major milestones and just say you know I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing it means the world to be at 800,000 subscribers you know when I started the channel I had no idea that it it would grow to be this big uh but here we are and I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing to the channel and I know I don't get everything right and I I do get things wrong um but I do appre appreciate you guys sticking with me uh either way so I just wanted to to acknowledge that and to say thank you to everyone for being a subscriber also the the having is is almost here and in fact by the time you watch this video the having's probably already happened um I'll try to get the video out here uh in a in a in you know 30 minutes or so um if we take a look when it's going to occur at least from when I'm recording this video it's going to be about 5 hours um but by the time you're watching this video it's probably going to be a lot less and it could already be behind us if you go look at the um at the the how many blocks it looks like we only have about 30 blocks to go so it is coming up really really soon and I I just think it's such a big event I'm going to try to live stream it that's my goal is to try to live stream the event uh it is in about again 5 hours it's going to be a little tricky cuz that's going to sort of correspond with some uh bedtime routines for my kids uh but I will try to to to live stream it if I can uh so do look out for that here in the next four or I guess by the time you're watching this video it'll be a different time but ideally I'm going to try to get get on here live by 8:30 Eastern um is my goal but again no promises so Bitcoin is is currently at at 64k we're going to keep this pretty short um because I mean you guys know my thoughts on the market but I do just want to say you know there there's a couple of different scenarios that could play out and I'm sure you've seen me talk about him a thousand times you've probably seen everyone else talk about him a thousand times the the sort of the two main short-term things so sort of the most likely outcomes in the short term are either you go straight to the 20we SMA following the habing or you get a bounce first to go just north of the 8 week moving average and then you resolve to a a lower low in May um off of off of whatever low this is you know so those are the sort of the two most likely shortterm outcomes to me again I I don't know which one will play out I I could certainly find evidence for both I will say you know with the S&P 500 at its own bull market support ban I I really do Wonder like well if if the S&P can go to it 20we SMA why can't Bitcoin you know I mean it's been a long time and with the S&P it had been really since November since it had been at its 20we SMA and now it's there once again and I wonder like you know with Bitcoin what's to keep it from going to its own 20we SMA it hasn't seen it since really mid October so if the S&P 500 can go there why can't Bitcoin in fact it's not even just the S&P if you were to look at at eth you can see it's been wicking down to its 20we moving average already you can see the riskier assets are already hitting it um if you look at at total three you can see that it's already been wicking down to its bull market support band so as you go you know further up the risk curve it's easier for those assets to hit that 20we SMA because when Bitcoin sneezes the the the altcoin market gets annihilated and you can see that I mean Bitcoin is still well above its 20we moving average in fact I mean in fact for it to go to its 20we SMA it would require about another 15 % drop from the current prices the problem with that for things like eth and and alts is that if Bitcoin were to do that then they likely go below their bull market support bands and this is exactly what we saw in 2019 right we saw eth go below its bull market support band after that local top just after eth Bitcoin broke down before Bitcoin did so that when Bitcoin bounced off of its 20we ese in the short term even didn't hold it as support eventually it bounced off of it ethusd basically just held resistance at the bull market support band so I I do think there there's some some reason to think it could play out like that you know as much as there there very well could be sort of a relief into late April early May um just keep an eye on on the 20we SME because you know the hard part with it is that you know you can look at at at prior local tops right you can look at things like 2021 and and 2019 and see that they had these rallies back up to the 8-week moving average on their first weekly close below the 8we moving average right so the first weekly close below the 8we right here in 2019 we rallied right back above the 8we and then formed a lower high in 2021 right same type of thing right go below the 8 we and then rally on back up the thing is is like we could see a weekly close below the 8we but we haven't necessarily even seen it yet also note that in 2019 after you had that rally back above the 8we it was after a 34% drop you know at this time Bitcoin has really only dropped about the same amount that it has been about 20% right I mean you know as much as it might feel like it's it's been more brutal this time that's only because the altcoin market is getting hammered but that's what alts do best in you know when Bitcoin sneezes alts get annihilated so you can see that so far this is a pretty standard drop for Bitcoin right 20% nothing too different from what we've seen um but do note that while it is 20% the the rally back to the 8we SMA in 2019 occurred after it had gone down you know closer to 30% which would actually get you near that 20we moving average so it's really hard to say and and while it is convenient of course to compare to 2019 and early 21 because you know I'm sure everyone would like that rally back up to the8 week SMA there's also other examples uh like like 20 late 2021 where you get something like this where you you know you're putting in these weekly closes where the Wicks are lower right you can see that right the Wicks are lower there as well just like they were over here um but you ended up just getting a capitulation down right so there's no guarantee right there's no guarantee with the market and I think like I I think honestly we're not going to you know next week will be sort of the decision point on on if you're going to bounce off of it or not um this week I imagine it's not going to you know we're not going to fully know I mean this you know it's already Friday anyways but yeah I I think it's just I mean it's certainly interesting because you're not only looking at at Bitcoin sort of slowly fading back in uh but you can see that a lot of other markets are as well right like the S&P is down to its bull market support band eth is down to its bull market support band or at least it has been wicking there it's not there at the current moment but it has been for the last couple of days off and on and then you have some altcoins that are below their 20we SMA already right I mean um I'm sure a lot of them are right I don't know if link is yeah link is Ada is Litecoin is not surprisingly madic is um dot is I mean a lot of them are already below their Market sport band so you can see that like the stronger assets are still above it Bitcoin is still above it right now but you know I I look at these other markets you know even the Russell the Russell is below it right so this is a great example of how the S&P is at the 20 we but the Russell is below it so you could see something happen very very similar in crypto where Bitcoin goes to its 20 we and when it does if and when it does then maybe alts go below it right that could could very well play out sometime after the having whether you get a rally to the 8we SMA or not right and again I don't know um if we're going to go to the 8 week ese next week or if it's going to be like you know a month later I could easily come up with a reason for either scenario easily easily it it's going to depend on what your bias is um so I I really I really can confidently say I don't know which one's going to play out but I will say that regardless of whether you get a relief to the 8we or not my expectation is that Bitcoin will go to the 20we moving average within the next few weeks right you know within probably either this month or next month is my guess I mean it's been a long time right I mean it seems like we're due for it in 2019 you know it it took about 25 weeks you know something like that in you know 2020 or so all the way through 2021 we fell back into it in in May in fact and that was about 32 weeks we're currently at what 26 weeks right so my guess is you know sometime in the next 6 weeks we're going to find ourselves at the bull market support band and then we'll see what's up again my guess is that if if Bitcoin sort of chops around in this range for a few months that's what should send the Bitcoin dominance to 60% right so if it goes down to the 20e Ese and then it bounces back up for a little bit to the 8we ese or vice versa goes to the a week first and then goes to the 20 week it's that chopping process that should break the altcoin market down and I mean you can see it already happening you know with eth Bitcoin which is something we've been following you know for a long time you know it's now at 0482 now it is you know talking about this sort of stuff on the the sort of the cusp of a major Bitcoin event you know there could be counter Trend rallies for this stuff but again you know my guess is that eth Bitcoin is is just sort of doing something like this after breaking down where it it sort of TR to hold on for a week but inevitably it keeps on bleeding into into the summer months where maybe it finally can potentially bottom so that is my view here going into into the having remember if there is a larger drop in the crypto verse uh following the having whether it's immediately after or whether it's delayed by a few weeks one thing to remember right one thing that I I I think you should remember is that when you measure things from the peak and you go Peak to Peak Bitcoin is ahead of schedule by a lot right it really is it can afford to give back a lot of that and still be in line with prior Cycles we've said that forever this is why I've said Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio because it's going to outperform the altcoin marketing till QE Returns the problem for alts you know I'll tell you the problem for alts is that if Bitcoin just drops back down here to get back in line with the prior Cycles just like last cycle it dropped back in line to get to get back in line with its prior cycle if Bitcoin drops here to get back in line with the last two cycles guess what alts can go back down to their lows or they can put in new lows because they're not that far off of their lows to begin with whereas Bitcoin is right you know Bitcoin is already well off its low whereas the alts a lot of them are not now some of them are but a lot of most of them are not really that far off of their low so I mean you know if you see a situation where Bitcoin just simply goes back to where it you know where it was in the last two cycles at this point that's how the altcoin market can put in you know a lot of alts can put in new lows even in the having year and we saw that happen last cycle as well and and I know there's always going to be some type of reason for it or justification or rationalization but that is just what I've seen you know cycle after cycle after cycle is that alts can get that bounce in the prehab year but inevitably as you get later on in the business cycle and we get you know as the Market is really starting to digest all those rate hikes and and the FED refusing to Pivot sufficiently that's where alts you know the order books are thin and that's where they just continue to slowly bleed uh not only on their USD pairs but also their Bitcoin Pairs and then my guess is that once you start getting multiple weekly closes by Bitcoin below its 20we moving average I think there's a good chance that at that point Bitcoin dominance has topped but between now and then I think that you're going to see it you're going to see Bitcoin USD sort of chop around in this range for a couple of months um and during that time I I think the Bitcoin dominance will go uh to 60% as eth Bitcoin goes to 003 to 04 and and all Bitcoin pairs go all the way back down from 0 42 to where they currently are down to about .25 best case scenario and that's if you want to say that they're oscillators right so back down to 0.25 or so so that is is really my view right now on the market um there are also sort of other views that you could look at that sort of revolve around if it wants to follow some of the prior you know the prior Trends with some major geopolitical events we did see Bitcoin over here you know put in some scary Wicks back in early 2022 um and then they still swept the local high after that so there is always a chance that something like that happens as well um so be ready for anything uh but I I do think that the market would greatly benefit from a a summer lull where it just kind of gets boring for a little while and all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out that's what I think would be the best case for the cryptoverse is a a summer where all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out because no one cares anymore you know all the hype is behind us and then then you start to see them find their true lows on their Bitcoin pairs you know for everyone who is who's laughed at the idea of the devaluation of all Bitcoin pairs they just put in a new low last week right they just put in a new new low last week so don't laugh at it I mean this is just what happened last cycle you know it's just exactly what happened and and if they do come back down here like over here then I I think there's no debating anymore that it it really is following sort of what 2019 was it's just that the reason why it was delayed until the having year was because rate Cuts occur potentially now in the having year as opposed to the preh having year like last cycle so to me it all looks like it's playing out in a very similar manner where all Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows just before rate Cuts arrive the onset of rate Cuts potentially as early as this summer should allow a Bitcoin pairs to bottom out and then a USD pairs can find whatever low they're going to find um based on how how low Bitcoin goes and then perhaps by the last rate cut uh then you start to see it go the other way the biggest Counterpoint to all these views is if it's a um you know if we just get some manic blowoff top or something this summer uh following some type of left translated cycle I mean you could have a left translated cycle where the top is is March right I mean that's what happened in the dot crash right I mean that the top was in March of the election year that's not really my base case though um but I I would say I would say that if you are to get a left translated cycle where Bitcoin just goes parabolic into all the um into all the bad news and everything then you know then that would sort of invalidate the views that I'm expressing um my base case though is that we are just simply repeating what we saw uh back over here and all Bitcoin pairs should come down as we get into this summer and and by you know maybe by June July something like that I I could see all Bitcoin pairs finally bottoming out not withstanding Maybe some future Bitcoin parabolic rally which we saw over here but that is is you know really my view on the market right now and we will see if it if it continues to pan out or not in the meantime bitcoin's at 64k um and we'll see if it if it goes to the 20we estimate in the next couple of weeks or if instead it first rallies back up to just above or just around its 8we moving average um uh first but either way I do think we are due for a test of the bullmark sport band here in the next you know month month and a half if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the crypts premium at intothe crypto.com we have tons of charts thousands of different charts for a lot of different cryptocurrencies if there's a lot of cryptocurrencies that you have that you wish I spoke about or you wish you could see the charts for those cryptocurrencies we have a lot of them on the website you know a lot of people call me a Bitcoin Maxi how many Bitcoin Maxis have website a website with thousands of charts for altcoins right so I I'm not I just I I'm I I put my maxi hat on when Bitcoin dominance is in a macro uptrend and I I don't really think you should blame me for that um but do check it out links in the description below that sale will end uh this weekend after the having so make sure you lock in the low rate between now and then and I will see you guys uh hopefully tonight for the uh for the live stream of the having which is only a few hours from now but I can't make any promises that I'll be there it's going to depend on on how some uh some of the family stuff goes but I will do my best to be there to live stream the having anyways I'll see you guys next time bye\n",

      "Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the having if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom the sale will be ending just after the having so make sure you check it out and lock in the lower rate let's go ahead and jump in the Bitcoin having is probably one of the most significant events in our industry I often find people debating every cycle you know whether the having is priced in or not whether it has an effect on pric or not my view is that you know we've had three having before we had one in 2012 one in 2016 and of course one in 2020 and I I certainly do think that the having does play a role in the cycles of the crypto verse um I also think that monetary policy plays a role but I don't really fall in either Camp completely I don't think that it's only based on supply side stuff and I don't think it is only based on you know monetary policy I think it's a combination of of different things markets are complex um they're they're based on a lot of different things and so because the having is one of the most important events I wanted to do a video where we talk about it and talk about where where I have previously said that theit the price of Bitcoin may be now price predictions are honestly something that I'm not super into um because usually you know usually price predictions don't really turn out that great if if you put in a price prediction and it goes above it then you know the comments aren't so nice and if you put a price prediction and we don't quite get there you know people are also upset but I wanted to to revisit something that I said four years ago and kind of see like where are we with respect to that so four years ago I put out this video Bitcoin Fair valuation at the next tabing in 2024 I put out this video in 2020 in May of 2020 the price of Bitcoin was around $8,000 and what I said back then was that if we follow the fair value logarithmic regression trend line then by the fourth having which is the having that's about to occur the price to bitcoin would be between 40 to $50,000 okay that's what I said back then clearly we are above that price right clearly if we go back and look at the video that I put out a year ago or no this was at the end of 2022 um or mid 2022 just before the the the um the final collapse occurred I also sort of Drew it out going to around a 40 to 50K so with Bitcoin right now at 63k it's ahead right I mean there's no denying it it's ahead of where I said it was going to be back then now of course back then putting out a price prediction four years later um and and hoping that it would be accurate at all was probably something I was fairly naive about uh but here we are 4 years later and the price of Bitcoin is actually above the target range that I put and it's also above this area that I put as well going into the having and so with that in mind I I want to discuss a couple of things that that may come up after the having um that could very well uh take some people by surprise now there's a lot of different thoughts to this current cycle with it being you know so hot at this point in the cycle we've never seen the market put in new highs before the having right this is the first time ever that Bitcoin has put in new highs before the having and so that was you know probably one of the reasons why back then I I didn't think it would be quite so high but we are at new highs before the having and so I just want to talk about what you know what to potentially expect after the happing now there's two different trends of thought here one of which is a left translated Peak okay now to be completely honest I'm not really in the left translated Peak camp but it does have like maybe 40% of my attention and the reason for that is if you were to take the ROI of Bitcoin from Peak to Peak and you take it from the April Peak Peak instead of the November 2021 Peak and you compare it to last cycle it sort of looks like it potentially could form into a peak sooner rather than later in which case you would get a left translated top meaning the the the actual top occurs way before anyone thinks it will historically Bitcoin has topped out in the fourth quarter of the post having year so if you look at Major Peaks that Bitcoin has had in the past if I were to get an arrow here you can see that this top was in Q4 of the post having year this one was in Q4 of the post having year and this one was in Q4 of the posst having Year we're currently in Q2 of the having year so you know that is is still about six quarters away when Bitcoin typically tops but again so far this cycle is anything but typical with Bitcoin putting in new before the having so if it is to translate into a left translated Peak a left translated cycle then it would be more likely that the top would occur in 2024 as opposed to 2025 if we are going to follow that then I have to imagine that we would follow potentially what happened last cycle now it's not really my base cas but again it would be foolish not to at least acknowledge the similarities but on the other hand where I would say 60% of my attention is right now is what if this cycle is just like prior cycles and we are all over here jumping through hoops trying to explain why this time is different when potentially it just Peaks when it normally does and one way that we could go about getting to that point would be that if we had a cool off in the summer okay now there's no guarantee and if we follow this path then you might see the exact opposite of a summer lull but if there is a summer lull then one thing to keep in mind when you look at the last two cycles as measured Peak to Peak you can see that at this point in the cycle Bitcoin was only up or it was it was actually still about 60% down from its all-time high now I want you to think about that for a minute in both prior Cycles at this point as measured Peak to Peak Bitcoin was 60% below the all-time high 60% below it now right now Bitcoin is not 60% below the prior high in fact 60% below the prior High would put Bitcoin all the way down at around $26,000 that's how accelerated we are this cycle look at the last cycle 60% down from that Peak you can see that by May of 2020 that was when the having occurred Bitcoin was down 60% from the high and then if you go back to the cycle before that this the that the having occurred in July if I remember correctly and if you go to July of 2016 you will see that Bitcoin was approximately down 60% from the high this having it's not right it's not 60% down from the high in fact it is at the high it's at the high which has never happened before so this has caused a lot of people to view this cycle as different from the prior ones and I have to tell you they make a fair point they make make a fair point and if you measure it from the April top you can kind of see that Bitcoin is doing just about what it always does at this point in the cycle if you take the April top as the more important top and of course there is evidence to suggest that the April top is the more important top for instance some of that evidence to suggest the April top is the more important top is to look at views to a lot of different cryptocurrency YouTube channels and to note that there were more views in the first half of 2021 than there were in the second half where Bitcoin basically just put in a lower high in terms of social activity but somehow a higher high in terms of price if you look at Bitcoin with respect to its 50e moving average one of the things that it does after every major cycle top is that it goes back down to the 50 we and then gets a bounce a dead cap bounce before ultimately capitulating we saw that happen over here as well go back to the 50 we get a dead bounce and then go all the way down this past cycle we did not see that exactly what happened was we went back to the 50 we and instead of it just being a dead cap bounce to a lower high which is what potentially that would have been we ended up getting a higher high which took a lot of people off guard now I was optimistic of a higher high but honestly I think because of for for wrong reasons you know and sometimes you get things right for the wrongs reasons and and it's important to take that into consideration so we can see that that happened right we can see that we went to the 50 we we got a bounce but that time it actually led to a higher high the even the intermediate bull market in 2019 had us bouncing off the 50 week at some point and so the 50 we today is at around 40K it's at 39.2k 39.3k which is interesting because again that is way below the current prices way below current prices and I have to imagine that if we do not evolve into a left translated top if we do not right so there's two op you know there's two options right we evolve into a left translated top where the peak occurs in 2024 or we evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 if we're going to evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 you really need to see Bitcoin cool off for a while and again as measured Peak to Peak you can see just how far quote unquote ahead of schedule this cycle is it's actually not that unfamiliar when you think about it the reason it seems like this time is different is because Bitcoin is at new all-time Highs but if you look at the last cycle there was a period where it too was well above its prior cycle but what eventually happened is it bled back down and basically got in line with the prior cycle and then still ended up showing diminishing returns okay and then it actually got ahead of that cycle again this is why a lot of people thought we were going to go to 300 K last cycle but it still was diminishing returns so I want to continue to put forth this idea that if we do not evolve into a left translated Peak sometime around the having and instead the market cools off going into the summer then you might just see something like this where it causes the cycle to just get back in line with prior Cycles now that of course could make a lot of people think that the cycle that the peak is over and and the Bull Run is is is completely done and and maybe they're right right but there is at least some evidence to suggest that that could be what is ultimately in store for us as we get lat into the cycle if you're not familiar with how the last cycle worked and why we what what happened when we bled back down here there's a number of things that really put Bitcoin back into a intermediate bare Market sort of you had a a quantitative tightening bull market and then a bare Market as rate Cuts arrived and then a QE bull market that topped in 2025 now take a a look at Bitcoin this cycle and see how it's doing something very very similar in the sense that it's had this major run during High interest rates you can see it's had this run during High interest rates and in fact if you were to look very closely at when the FED paused here and compare it to this you can see something very similar happened right it it fell just after the FED paused here it fell just after the FED paused and then it went up quite a lot but ultimately what happened is that it it found a local top as just before rate Cuts arrived and then it bled for a while before getting another bull run into the post having year now by the way the having is only four four days away so if we do come up and put in a new local high before the having or maybe around the having that still doesn't necessarily invalidate the idea of the market cooling off sometime after the having if the left translated Peak is not going to occur okay so again there's two thoughts you have a left translated Peak where us Deens just can't help ourselves and everyone just front run runs everything until until the consumer caves or the other idea which would support the idea of this time not being different would just for the cycle to get back in line now if the cycle gets back in line then maybe this view from four years ago of around a you know 40 to 50K Bitcoin by the fourth having isn't that far off I know right now if we were to go back to 40 to 50 okay it would probably feel like the world's falling apart for a lot of people but one thing to consider is that when when e I'm you know I don't know how I made it this far in the video without talking about it one thing to consider last cycle is that the 30% drop Bitcoin had pretty shallow drops during this QT bull market right pretty shallow drops and then eventually it finally got a 30% drop that 30% drop corresponded precisely to the point when eth Bitcoin broke down and eth Bitcoin just broke down below the summer 2022 low so if you were to get a 30% drop sometime after the having that would actually put you kind of right around that range that we said way back over here and in addition to that it would also get you Loosely backed in line with where the prior Cycles were so going into this Bitcoin having is certainly different in the sense that we've never seen a new all-time high before the habing if you were to go look at the risk metric of Bitcoin you will see that the risk on bitcoin has never been this High going into the having in fact the last time we went into the the the 20 when we went into the 2020 having the risk of Bitcoin was at 04 when you look at the 2016 having in July of 2016 the risk on bitcoin was 0.4 today the Bitcoin risk is6 so it's actually quite a bit higher than it was during the last two 3 to4 this time we find ourselves at 639 and only a few weeks ago the risk was in the 7 to8 risk band to give you an idea of what the 04 risk band would look like which is where we were going into the last two that's where the 04 to 0.5 wristband is that's where the price of Bitcoin was at the last two Habs and you can see actually that Bitcoin when those rate Cuts arrived right here had that correction back to the 100 we moving average now what's fascinating about that is that it would correspond to the prior breakout zone so I I I feel like there's two different ways that we can look at the market here here that make the most amount of sense number one is that this is not different from the prior cycles and we're kind of on track with where we should be and that could be viewed by maybe looking at the ROI after the after the low if you look at the ROI after the low and you compare this cycle with two cycles ago this is exactly where we were but you can see that it at this point it did cool off for a while and then did get a drop kind of um you know this was day 520 or so about you know a month and a half from now or so so you can view it like that or you can view it from the peak and still say we're where we should be based on uh based on measuring it from the April top right if you take this out Peak to Peak if you measure it from the April top we're pretty much where we should be but again I can't help but think are we are we are we doing the same thing again where everyone tries to come up with a reason for why this time is different but in reality it's not so my thought process on the matter is this as we go into the Bitcoin having if Bitcoin accelerates into the having and post having and into June right if it is something like that where you know over here in 2019 in fact before rate Cuts arrived it actually did rally in until June last year we had a a local top in April but then we swept the high in June if we get something like that where Bitcoin continues to go up throughout the summer then I would be more in tune with the idea of a left translated top where you get a top in 2024 as opposed to say 2025 however on the other hand if you get a low Top by Bitcoin here as rate Cuts arrive and then instead of you know and that could still include sweeping the prior high right but if you get a look kind of like we did over here with the spot ETF we we put in a new high on the day of the spot ETF for the cycle if on the other hand we see the market cool off into the summer and go to say the 04 to 0.5 wristband or even the 0. 3 to point4 wristband and we get the market more back in line with the prior two cycles then I I think that perhaps the base case should still be that the cycle is playing out just as it always has and you still could get a top in in late 2025 and in fact it was this very intermediate bare Market that kind of scared a lot of people off in fact what happens if something like that happens again where rate Cuts arrive and you go back down scares a lot of people off and then because everyone gets scared off the FED starts printing money again and then you get a QE bow Market I've said this before and I'll say it again there's two types of bull markets in crypto there's quantitative tightening bull markets that occur during periods when the FED is lowering reducing the assets on their balance sheet that's what we got in 2019 and that's what we've got over here and during those periods during those periods eth Bitcoin goes down eth Bitcoin goes down during QT quantitative tightening bull markets how many people for the last couple of years have said that eth outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market that's not true not without any disclaimer because as you can see bitcoin's been going up since late November of 2022 and eth Bitcoin has been going down the entire time so that is why I still think there is some evidence to suggest the cycle may play out like it always does rather than a left translated top I'm not completely unsympathetic to the idea of a left translated Peak there's a lot of really smart people out there that frankly provide a compelling case for it and I could honestly provide a compelling case for it I just showed you guys some of the different charts but if Bitcoin does not run into the highest wristbands the 0. N to one wristband this summer and instead it just cools off like it did back over here after the having it might scare a lot of people off but perhaps it's just doing what it did last cycle and it the only reason that the top the local the midcycle top came later was because rate Cuts came later this cycle than they did last cycle so you have quantitative tightening bull markets where Bitcoin goes up as e Bitcoin bleeds all Bitcoin pairs bleed and then you have QE bull markets that go where Bitcoin goes up as eth Bitcoin goes up so eth outperforms Bitcoin in a QE Market but not a QT Market there's two different different types of bull markets so that is a very important distinction and I think we've only received more and more evidenced over the last year that Bitcoin really is dependent somewhat on monetary policy because last September when eth Bitcoin came back down to to this area right here there were there were a lot of people that thought that it had bottomed because that's when it had bottomed in the last cycle Q3 of the pre having year this development here which is what I said was likely going to happen this development of the the devaluation of eth against Bitcoin shows that the market is very much dependent on monetary policy whether we want to believe it or not so if that is the case right if that continues to be the case then you very well could see a a repeat of what happened over here sort of an intermediate Lull in the market followed by because of rate Cuts right that occur during rate Cuts followed by the last rate cut which leads to a QE bull market where you maybe top out when you normally do in the latter part of the post tapping year so two different theories if you're new here that's what is you know has really been discussed over the last uh year or so is this cycle different is it not I honestly think if you if you have a bias on it you're going to find the evidence that you're looking for um I I think we we'll know soon enough we we'll know soon enough if Bitcoin cools off into the summer which it very well could we we've seen gold breakout just like it did in mid 2019 we've seen eth Bitcoin break down just like it did in mid 20 M mid 2019 all Bitcoin pairs still haven't broken down yet but if it cools off into the summer then it just seems like it's the same thing as last cycle it's just that the the midcycle top was nine months later about about n nine months later if on the other hand after the having Bitcoin just accelerates to the upside once again then I will have to uh I will probably say that there's more Merit to the idea of of a left translated top but that's what I'm looking at right now and so to just revisit my prediction back in 2020 what would be the fair value of Bitcoin at the fourth having of 40 to 50k I find myself today seeing a $64,000 Bitcoin 4 days before the having and I I can't think I can't help but think to myself wow back then when I made that prediction I thought it was a lofty prediction that frankly was maybe not you know not that likely to come true because you know when Bitcoin is at 8K and and it really hadn't done anything for a couple of years I wasn't really that optimistic um of of you know exactly how accurate this prediction would be come to find out I was too conservative potentially right I was too conservative so it just goes to show how difficult these markets are to predict um four years ago price of Bitcoin was at 8K I said fourth having 40 to 50 instead we find ourselves at 64 and what's fascinating to me is that if we were at 40 to 50K I think it would you know a lot of people would think the the world's falling apart when in reality that would have been what the fair value sort of suggested it would be and that chart that chart that you see in that video is just this chart right here um these regression bands here so at the last taing we were at the fair value that's the other thing that why I said 40 to 50K back then because at every prior having Bitcoin was at the fair value so in no the fit to non-bubble data so in November 2012 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to non-bubble data in July of 2016 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to quote unquote non-bubble data in May of 2020 Bitcoin was at its fair value fit to again quote unquote non bubble data theoretically I should have updated this chart because it does I think need to get updated every cycle I haven't really done it yet if I did update it it would just shift it down very very slightly but right now according to this chart the fair value is around um 52k 52k but if you if you were to refit it based on this data over here it would actually probably put the fair value somewhere between 40 to 50K which is why I said back over here like we'll have to refit it um and and it'll be around 40 to 50K so we're above that level right now if on the other side of the having or something we see that level just know that that is is is what the um you know the regression band would have ultimately suggested for this part of the cycle so those are my thoughts going into the Bitcoin having we will see what happens uh as the having comes around it's only four days away and and we will do an update in maybe a month or so we'll see what happened you know after the having if we just contined to rally on into a left translated top or if it cools off like 2019 and and we just kind of come back down and and cool off until until the last rate cut arrives if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs

      "Hi, this is NFA live this should be a relatively exciting show for two reasons first of all we have the Bitcoin having coming up in just about a day and we also have a new guest with us today Max from because Bitcoin uh how you doing great thanks so much for having me Ben yeah and you started you started doing this a year or two ago is that right yeah probably about 18 months ago officially yep all right yeah so max is um I've known him basically since probably before he even started the YouTube channel or right around the time that he started it uh so make sure you guys go subscribe to him and Rob as well uh links to that are in the description below so make sure you guys check that out and we're just going to go through a lot of the different questions that I think would probably be on people's minds as we go into the having uh so let's just go ahead and jump in Rob we'll start with you on this one the having is tomorrow it's tomorrow we've been waiting forever here it is fourth having um and I'm guessing it's going to garnish some attention should be making some headlines different places I'm curious what what effects do you think the having will have on the larger crypto space um do you think it'll bring new eyes to the scene or are we still kind of just uh you know the same old same old people just kind of hanging out um do you think it'll it'll actually bring new new people to the space uh we saw a lot of new people come to the space last cycle sometime after the having um or do you think it'll be quiet for a while and do you see any narrative shifts after the Havoc that's a pretty loaded question first of all I would just like to say that Max has a great background I'm sure he got to the same place I did which is fivr and uh hopefully he didn't get ripped off but it looks great and uh I gotta tell you one of these days max we're gonna have to put that into an nft just me and you so yeah yes that is my old green screen but I'll be jumping in that green screen as soon as the uh as the Bitcoin hits 100K But to answer Ben's question which I think is is what uh everybody wants to really try to figure out is this Bitcoin having and I know like there's a lot of first of all that I still believe in the fouryear cycle some people say that it doesn't really register I still and some people will talk like Bob Lucas will say well it's just left translated and we're going to see a big blowoff top in 2024 which could very well happen but I still think that the narrative around it and there's still a lot of people say well there's Mass adoption coming and it's already here I still think it's I mean I don't think that we're at the same level like we should be and what we could be in like 2028 or 2032 or you know time comes up but Ben if you get to show my my screen real quick because everyone wants to know like well the Bitcoin having and you did a great I I watched your your video Ben about uh uh the ethereum evaluation ethereum ethereum valuation of Bitcoin about how you know Bitcoin dominance is going up and how it's wreaking havoc and it's true it is right now I know people will will also talk about you know like hey well you know these things happen leading up to the having but if we take a look back this is from Smart Valor it's a good website and if we take a look they did all the work for him which is great this is how Bitcoin behav in the year leading up to each having because we had one of course in 2012 2016 then 2020 and I know people will say well there's always a dip there's always this massive dip before the having and there could be I mean we saw one pretty massive one in 2020 but of course there's a reason for that and and we could either say like it's because of the of the almighty Corona virus or it was something else but yeah there was a dip in 2016 but again just take a look at this so with having with the having one in 2012 the year leading up to the having it went up to 385 per. and the year after of course because we always see alltime highs the year after so far it went up 5,000% having two in 2016 leading up to it 142% now there's dips along the way and we're seeing that right now but then a year after that in 2017 2 84% in 2020 even though there was a turbulent year like we talked about it was still up 17% for the year getting into that having in May I think it was May 12 2020 and then it went up almost five almost 600% the year after that and we can see here that that yeah same thing happened the year leading up to to the having on November 208th 2012 this is what Bitcoin was 250 and then of course we come up and then you can see right here that yes there is a a drop before that and then it comes up and there's a drop before but it's like the same thing as like a bull market so we're seeing the same thing kind of Replay I know it's a funny thing because like Ben you'll say like uh you say hey I I I told you that the Bitcoin ethereum evaluation was going to start to start to lose momentum or actually bleed away to ethereum and then people were going to blame a Black Swan event and they never would have saw it coming but here we are and again same thing happens here 2015 a year going into it yes it's not a straight line but we kind of I mean really rallied into it there's you know dips along the way but I mean it's going in that right direction and then of course 2019 to 2020 we started at 7325 we had it kind of flat and then we saw the almighty Corona virus right here but then we rallied into it so I still feel like the same thing's gonna Happ happen that's just how I see things and I'm I'm feeling pretty good about this having so far but the big question is and and we we'll talk about this later is what's the macro is there going to be quantitative easing or more quantitative Tiding are they actually going to cut rates are we going to have the liquidity that we absolutely need which we had beforehand even though we're in quantitative uh tightening right now I mean we still rallied pretty well but can we get that liquidity back in the market and that's I think that's the big question on top of the fact of are we going to see World War II so yeah that's where I got yeah it's interesting because you know at some point you would think we would need to make the shift from quantitative tightening to quantity to quantitative easing but what needs to trigger that shift is the is the is the thing that I I think we're kind of wrestling with um someone asked where a guy was I I should have mentioned that he's he's in Dubai and I mean there's obviously a lot of stuff going on right there going on right now there with the conference and um everything so he wasn't able to make it this week um so um Max I I'll put the same question to you I mean like what are your thoughts here on the Bitcoin having um is this just kind of the same old thing that we've seen before and everyone's trying to over complicate it uh do you see any kind of shifts coming after after the having what are your thoughts yeah I I would agree with the with the last part I think that a majority of people and it's very easy to do this I I tend to do it all the time is to sort of chronically over complicate something that has for over a decade now been a pretty reliable uh we'll just we'll call it a risk on event and in the simplest of terms all you need to do is you know pull up your trading view chart and Mark out every single Bitcoin having right you need at this point you know you need to draw four vertical lines whenever a Bitcoin having has occurred look at the the price action that has basically come almost immediately following so um you know I I try to look at this thing from Every Which angle you know I look at it from the side I look at it up side down I you know I try to include the macro and and fed policy in all of my decisionmaking but um you know the truth of the matter is this is a very unique time to be in the markets right Bitcoin is now on the global stage in my opinion for the first time um there is you know new on-ramps into crypto you know specifically being these you know nine ETFs um and it is you know there's more regulatory Clarity the accounting standards have shift did in a positive light and are working to you know become more friendly for corporations and big money to actually onboard into this digital commodity if they choose to do so um but again like Rob had mentioned and Ben like you commented on there also are some macro headwinds which can only be ignored for so long unfortunately I am of the belief that we do still have some time I believe we're maybe on borrowed time some people probably don't like to hear that but but I do believe that there is this this unique pocket of time where it's all coming together and we can really see risk perform um positively of course I don't have to tell you guys this and I probably don't have to tell the audience this but historically during a Fed pause until something has quote unquote kind of broken and we see Unemployment uh you know trending above 4% and the FED actually has to step in and begin easing through you know interest rate cuts and other measures um we can actually see risk you know being stocks and now crypto performed tremendously well and you know going back to you know to the last cycle you know we actually kind of went through a little mini fed cycle here and you know 2018 2019 and 2020 um you know where Bitcoin actually the floor kind of gave out we dropped to about 3K and then we had that famous rally into June of 2019 when we topped um you know there was actually hikes going into that and then of course right as Bitcoin basically topped in June of 2019 the FED began to actually cut rates um more or less right after that and it did dramatically affect Bitcoin some will say you know it was a reflexivity and you know we had to you know we we sprung hard off of that local floor so you know of course the market corrects to the downside some will say it's covid some will say it was in the charts the whole time some will say it's not I don't know you know nobody knows whether it would have happened with Co or or without um but again I don't think that this time really is that much different I think that every cycle has some distinct differences from from a previous one I mean for example last cycle we had a double top we haven't had a true double top before we have had a cycle like the 2013 one where we had you know two pronounced Peaks but a true double top had never happened before and additionally in the bare Market we had never spent as much time below the 200 WEA as we just did coming out of this most recent bear so there are you know of course Very recognizable and notable differences of every cycle but you to answer the question Point Blank I don't think that this time is much different and I I'm trying my best to not overthink it um and say you know what there is no reason for the FED to intervene at this point we're trending in that direction and we are on borrowed time there is a Day of Reckoning coming but I do believe at the earliest it's probably sometime in Q4 we have the having you know in less than two days and I do believe that there's plenty of room for risk to run in the short to Middle term maybe going out six months okay yeah no I mean it's great to get you guys opinions um and the market has been on an absolute tear I mean essentially after since October right I mean it was pretty boring summer last year but then since October uh the market has basically just been up only up until the last few weeks but um you know the next thing I'd like to talk about is of course Rob's absolutely favorite topic and it's of course Bitcoin dominance um and you know I you know you guys know My Views but I always like to get other other views because you know I'm I it's it's a good idea not to live in an echo chamber so Bitcoin dominance has once again broken a new highs I I we saw 57% actually it came really really quickly really quickly you know that that move to 57% it's kind of cooled off back you know it's back down to like the 55 like 55 and a half or so so it has cooled off quite a bit since that rally up to 57% uh so uh Max I'll start with you first on this one do you think it's going to keep going up after the having um you know it was it it was going up into the spot ETF and then it kind of waned a little bit following the spot ETF but then it just kind of picked right back up so what do you think is gonna happen this time and and this kind of goes to the whole like the last question as well like will there be a narrative shift and what people are focused on will they will they start focusing on more things besides you know sticking with Bitcoin um do you see you know what are your thoughts on that Max well first I have to give you a compliment Ben because you were one of the few people that with a big following publicly called Bitcoin dominance rallying to this point I didn't expect it to get up to I think it topped at what 57 recently or wherever did you you deserve a lot of credit for that well I'm known for riding Trends too long see well we'll see right nobody knows besides the market right like you know we we all have our our inclinations but uh you deserve a lot of credit because I remember months and months AG I don't it was probably six months ago plus we did a space together or you came on on my my channel because Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance was significantly lower and eth BTC was significantly higher and much has changed since then so kudos to you where do I think it goes from here so I think that Bitcoin dominance is in the process of we'll call it distribution okay I believe believe that the meat of the move is over um but that does not preclude it from going a little bit higher than here maybe maybe 60% that's not my base case but you know let's let's look left on the chart and you know use that to you know maybe forecast what could happen next so ignoring the you know whether this is a left translated cycle or an expedited cycle let's look at it contextually for where Bitcoin is at um you know from from a a p perspective right so Bitcoin actually has gone on to get above the previous cycle all-time high of 69k so most comparably again ignoring everything else but just pure levels on the chart pure you know where was the cycle High where was the cycle low you could probably compare Bitcoin right now to like December of 2020 okay if we just ignore everything else and say okay Bitcoin in December of 2020 went on to sweep the previous cycle all-time high of 197 it paused there for what maybe a month or or something like that it was chopping around altcoins got destroyed during that time right Bitcoin uncertainty like you always preach Ben uh when Bitcoin is uncertain alts get absolutely eviscerated and we are seeing that once again right so um again comparing this period of time to December of 2020 there is turbulence under the previous cycle all-time high which is not uncommon we saw that again last cycle and then also two cycles ago it seems to be sort of the same thing happening again what did we see in December of 2020 well what we saw was Bitcoin dominance basically put in a deviation or bull trap High where on when Bitcoin finally decided it was time to push through with conviction above the previous cycle all-time high of 197 you saw Bitcoin dominance put in an explosive move which ultimately ended up being sort of a bull trap you know for for the Bitcoin Maxis um so I I think it's possible we are seeing that Devi that deviation high right now only time will tell um I do have hedges in place you know like I'm I'm holding some Bitcoin l2s like STX and some Bitcoin ordinals and things like that that I think would be beneficiaries of you know Bitcoin dominance continued rally maybe above 60% um but of course you know I I really I am of the belief that contextually with Bitcoin chopping under the previous cycle all-time high seeing similar signs of Bitcoin dominance putting in you know this this last explosive push I do believe that over the next six months or so it would probably makes sense to see Bitcoin dominance Trend down dramatically and additionally and and I don't mean to you know bring this up because I don't know if this is on the agenda today exactly I imagine that that would translate to eth BTC finding a bottom sooner rather than later but that doesn't again preclude it from going down a little bit more and only time will tell yeah no I mean it's great and I mean I I I think it's always worthwhile to hear these other views because um you know no one really knows right I mean you know no one really knows and you know one thing that I've wrestled with a lot before and I've seen other people do this too is like you know just because someone gets something right doesn't mean they're going to be right they're going to keep being right right and also just because someone gets something wrong doesn't mean they're GNA be keep being wrong I mean you know markets change no one knows what's going to happen and I I I could see eth Bitcoin carving out a bottom this summer um that's kind of my base case I could see that actually happening so we'll see if that happens Rob what are your thoughts I mean I know you're you're more of a you're more of a Bitcoin Maxi yourself right Bitcoin dominance to 100% I yes exactly go ahead Ben what was your question I'm just kidding I'm just kidding what what are your thoughts here on on on dominance do you think it's uh you think we're getting pretty close to the uh to the top well first of all let me just say that I I I was like listening to to Max especially on like the Twitter spaces and things like that he's very smooth in his delivery and very smart and and what he talks about so I gotta tell you it's good to hear like different sets of opinions it's great to have a Max here so to talk about I mean Bitcoin dominance I got to tell you like when you were talking the 60% I'm like yeah you know I can kind of see it you know I was I was I was under the assumption like well you know it always kind of comes back that way right something happens there's something that happens in the market a Black Swan event or you know something that's just that kind of has disruption and then people get scared and they're they're like okay I'm risk on but not that risk on to go into like you know Pepe coin I'm gonna go into the safest asset in the most volatile industry which would be Bitcoin and I I could see that for sure but then like there's a narrative that that people are always talking about especially in in in the crypto space being the Bitcoin maxos are going to say Bitcoin only right but there are narratives that are out there one of those is dpin Right centralized physical infrastructure Network the other one are dexes because we see what's going on with the centralized exchanges getting sued getting their pants sued off by the SEC and then leaving of course so we have to have dexes and then of course there's another big one which is web 3 so we talk about that but there's one that I feel is on an undertone and Max alluded to it when he was talking about it when he talked about runes and he talked about ordinals and he talked about things like stacks and l2s and I think what's gonna really push Bitcoin dominance up I know Ben loves this part too is uh the the l2s or even l1s that are going to be built on bitcoin Ben if you just throw this this chart up I always talk about this website it's l2. watch so imagine this and I and and and even like Adam back has talked about this how he's talked about he hates the fact that everybody's building off of Bitcoin people should just build on bitcoin because he says it's like it's it's like the tcpip layer for for the internet so why can't they just build on the most the safest most secured Network or computerized Network ever built in the entire world and he was right so when I take a look at these these l2s that are coming out and they're all new so you I to understand like this some most of these are trash let's just let's just call it SP Spade but like when we talk about things that are coming out that are actually doing pretty good like a Stax who's been around for quite some time I can really see things actually happening for sure and then like I just dropped a a video on my second Channel where I talked about core core is a top uh 50 well it's 56 now but it's essentially an L1 L2 type of uh uh token which is built right on top of Bitcoin using delegated proof of work and delegated proof of stake together to actually make dexes nfts and a whole host of things you can only do with smart contracts so when I see stuff like this happening I'm like why can't we take away the nonsense that's going on over in ethereum world and they're massive gas fees like just like with with core and stacks right now if you use it or the things that are being built on top of it they're just going through their Satoshi initiative it's super cheap and it's super fast so for me to see that Bitcoin dominance could go up why couldn't it especially with the different institutions that are here and how they've been drilled into it now they can say oh there's something else I can do and also smart I see it could actually go above 60% but again I'm not always right no I mean I I've it's possible it's certainly possible um I think the answer is going to probably come in the next few weeks because you know there's two prior examples where we had these kind of these like closes below the 8we ese 2021 and 2019 and in 2021 after it happened Bitcoin got a rally eth Bitcoin went up but in 2019 when Bitcoin got that rally eth Bitcoin went down so I think if we see Bitcoin get some type of relief I don't know maybe sometime after the having into may I I don't know exactly when it would be but whenever that comes whatever happens to eth bitcoin should be very telling about where we are in the cycle so I I'm going to be focused a lot on that um over the next few weeks but we will see um next question Rob I'm GNA start with you on this one to rotate and you know I remember last year you saying something like this um and and you ended up being correct it was basically you know sell and man go away um like I mean no one's D Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear since October I mean you know I mean it was basically like 25 to 30k not even that long ago um and I I think sometimes we forget just how quickly it has moved so I'm curious like do you think it's going to be similar to last summer where we just get the market gets boring before maybe moving up again like later in the year or something you think it's just going to get boring for a few months um do you think or on the other hand do you think everyone's gonna get think it's boring and then we just get another you know face what's it called like a face melting Rally or something that's exactly face yeah I mean like so so what are your thoughts going into the summer because I mean again I know last summer you you thought it was going to be boring do you think it's going to be boring again this summer or you think it's going to be different Matt well first of all I I hope so I I really do because everybody who's in the chat right now answer a question for me uh tell me if you think that you've accumulated enough where you're like you know what I've bought plenty of Bitcoin and I just cannot handle any more bags I just I don't want to buy anymore especially if it goes down and gets cheaper just let me know in the comment section because it seems like when these types of things Ben when you say things are boring this is great because this is when people who like the dollar cost average is fantastic or if you're Dynamic DCA is things go down which I think where we at the risk levels now 0.6 0.59 somewhere around there a little yeah I think a little above 0 six so like if we're in this place we're like well I mean for me this is a good time to just accumulate a little bit but as we start to like if it goes sideways well great I have more time to bring things in but then if you if you want to talk about selling May and go away there's this great chart on this website that I steal from constantly and if you just take a look because it's it's yeah it's a nice website it's very nice I think there's a sale going on until like tomorrow and then it goes away so but if if you say sell in May and go away it it actually works out pretty well I mean historically speaking but then if you really want to break it down because people say but Rob you don't get it because this is the having year so it's all it doesn't really it count well if you take a look at it I mean if you sold at the end of May of 2020 I mean you had a 30% increase on January a couple of drops there 34 and 10% and then you're down here and you just kind of stay away until October and then you buy in and then October rallies November rallies and December rallies that's not bad I mean I'll take that year right and if we go back to 2016 I mean it's the same type of thing if I want to sell in May okay well June's gonna go up but I have red red I take I stay away September as well and I I buy back in October November December I'm doing pretty good so I still think it can work out all right the thing that you have to understand though and one more thing is is this there's a presidential election I think this is going to be pretty tumultuous as we get into it so there was this piece from hbk's wealth and it talked about the presidential election years versus the non-election as far as returns and this is just taking a look at the S&P 500 you can see that in the presidential election years which this is that year it sends to like kind of peek off around March April and then just kind of fall away until we get into junisha may go away October is here you buy back in and then we have a nice little rally of course drop here and then off we go but 10% for that year is not too bad now does that mean that I'm going to sell everything no no I'm just telling you these are just the data points that we can say take a look at me personally I'm just here to accumulate and uh get into some early round type of cryptos that could either make a lot of money or go to zero one of those two will always happen yeah I was looking at this um this is uh this is the S&P 500 in 2024 compared to the average of all election years right I mean so you can see like it has come down a lot recently but it also went up a lot too like way more than it does on average so there's just been a lot more volatility this cycle than I think we've seen in a lot of Prior Cycles um but yeah I I thought that was interesting and that chart sort of reminded me of that uh Max what are your thoughts here I mean I know earlier you said you expected uh risk to do pretty well um over the next six months but you know even with that do you think that the market could cool off before that phase or do you think it's not going to really get much of a breather or do you think the Breather is almost over yeah that's it's a it's a great question of course we're all from relatively familiar with the uh maybe cliche but overused but also kind of accurate saying of sell and may go away um one thing that I've been preaching for a while going back to I mean even I would say Q4 of last year is that I was seeing signs early on of a maybe expedited cycle for crypto um and it's probably off of of you know the back of this this fed paw and there isn't quite as much in my opinion economic deterioration as a lot had thought myself included and we're in this you know kind of Goldilocks window where risk can rally really unencumbered um you know so so do I think that selling may go away will come to fruition I I would think that worst case in my opinion from what I'm seeing right now and again of course subject to change it's just one man on the internet's opinion I think that similarly to how this cycle for crypto is being a little bit front Rand and we've actually seen for the first time a Bitcoin all-time high before a having which of course had never happened before um I also think it's possible that selling may go away is being front ran a little bit and we're seeing that right now with this April correction so similarly to Rob I am not I am not in the camp of you know drisking or selling spot because again like I mentioned in you know during our first question here if you just draw four vertical lines on your trading View and Mark out every Bitcoin having look what typically happens in the six to nine months following Additionally you know for a lot of us that have been slowly you know and thoroughly meticulously dcing into our digital digital assets and our unregistered Securities over the past year you know a lot of us have tax consequences for selling right now and I'm I'm not really interested in incurring any uh you know tax consequences trying to reposition because May perhaps is a little bit choppy so in my opinion you know and again going back you know the past 18 months for Bitcoin we haven't seen more than a 22% correction on bitcoin so from our local high recently take it down 22 to 25% maybe you get 57 56 worst case that's not enough for me to incur you know a taxable event to try to reposition so uh maybe it happens maybe it doesn't but for me ultimately it doesn't make a big difference because the having is in a couple days um and typically what happens after a having is months and months of prosperity and hopefully price discovery yeah no it's a fair point I mean I think like all the corrections that we've had by Bitcoin for the entire bull market have only been about 20 to 22% yeah we've already seen it go down about what 18% or so um so that I think that'll be the the area I mean if we get down there see if it turns around and if it does maybe the time's not different you know but yeah what do you think Ben do you think selling May and go away will come to ahead um I think now I mean so I so we went into the 7 to point8 risb in March so that I think was the time to to drisk some kind of like during the spot ETF um at this point it's kind of like when we went back to 39K after the spot ETF um we then it was it was a 22% drop and then we just rallied after it right and and so I was like you know this could be our preh having year dip and then the rally just continued and so now it's kind of the same thing it's like you know the the area to do it if you were convinced about it would have been in in March you know um when gold broke out because that's actually in 2019 when Bitcoin topped was when gold broke out um so I think that would have been the time to do it now I do think there is a risk of if you've waited if you've waited till this point and now bitcoin's down 20% we did see both in after the 20209 or the 2019 top and the 2021 top the first weekly close bow of the 8we SMA we then had a rally back up you know to the we right which is around 67k we actually went slightly above it in both cases so I think what what's more important is not exactly what happens here at the range lows but it's what happens whenever we get a relief move does it sustain or does it just put in a lower high I think that is kind of the thing to look for because back in after the spot ETF it wasn't a lower high we just you know had another face ripping rally fire um the the reason why I am more cautious on this one than than the last one is because eth Bitcoin has now broken down and gold is broken out which both of those events marked the 2019 local top and it wasn't the market cycle top and this kind of goes back to what Rob was saying you know there is this idea of a left translated peak in 2024 and I can sort of like I'm like 30% maybe 40% aware of that like you know thinking hey this is this could actually happen you know if if we were to Rally into the summer to higher prices without cooling off then I would be very more so convinced of a left translated Peak but what if what if if you think about what happened after the 2019 top after gold broke out and after e Bitcoin broke down Bitcoin went into a six to n month bare Market in fact now imagine you get that after the having and everyone thinks the cycle is over by the end of 2024 because it just hasn't done anything since the having and then we just get another move in 2025 and then the cycle Peaks when it always does and once again everyone over complicated it you know like there is a chance that that that happens um so I would I think I would just watch to see what happens whenever we get any type of relief does it form into a lower high or does it lead to a higher high and then you probably have your answer to whether it's a left translit cycle or not at that point I can see absolutely yeah and again even in 2019 it was it was just a local top we bled for a while we actually bled back to the 100 we SMA um and then and then we started to go back back up and then we had the we had the pandemic crash but if you ignore that it was just sort of a bleed after all Bitcoin pairs broke down and then and then once we got that back you know we start to go back up those are my and and by the way I mean you've always said this going back when you know before I started my business and I was watching all of your videos you know years ago Ben you used to always say something kind of along the lines of you know the longer it takes you know the higher will ultimately go something along those lines and you know I think a uh this idea of a prolonged sort of midcycle Correction freaks a lot of people out because everybody wants to be rich overnight myself included right of course i' I'd love for us to just go straight up in a straight line and I hope that we do but ultimately I don't think it would be a death sentence for Bitcoin to kind of reestablish value between 55 and 75k for even a full quarter um you know I think ultimately would probably lead to more constructive uh price action to the upside in the long run but people you know their patients will be tested no question yeah yeah I mean I think the the the thing to look for in the cycle I think is is the Bitcoin dominance I I really do think it's the key for the cryptoverse and I think I think that dominance will Top before Bitcoin Falls below the 20we SMA that's my guess is that it's going to top before Bitcoin Falls below it and I think between now and then Bitcoin gets occasional rallies that just take off Bitcoin pairs even lower is my guess um so that's why I just say like you know if you want exposure to crypto Bitcoin I mean you know Bitcoin is is a relatively safe bet if you want to take on more risk there's obviously the altcoin market there's the full DJ mcoin Market um but you have to be careful with those and I I I think the winning strategy with the altcoin market and and even if you are in the riskier memec coin stuff is just to remember like in five years that Meme coin is probably not going to exist No One's Gonna care about it because they're going to be worried about the next stage of mean points right so the way the way to navigate it is it's okay to have exposure to various parts if you want to take more risk but just occasionally convert it back to bitcoin if you make a lot of money right because at least you know you then know hey Bitcoin is still going to be around in 10 years I don't know if this random meme coin is Ben how could you say that how dare you my a meme coins oh my I think I've converted most of my audience to bitcoin Maxis at this point but I will say by the time I convince the last person to be a Bitcoin Maxi that's when the dominance tops out and we go back the other way I don't think we're that far away I think maybe this summer dominance tops out we'll see though but you are correct like what anybody out there like if we're being completely honest Would You Bet Your Life that Your Meme coin or your altcoin is going to be around in 50 years would You Bet Your Life on it I probably would not would I bet my life I mean it's an extreme example right would I bet my life or something valuable that Bitcoin will be around bet your would you bet all your money on it or something right that's much more friendly right so and I would for Bitcoin I have a high degree of confidence and that's why your strategy ultimately it's conservative you know relative to a lot of other people that you know talk about crypto publicly but it is ultimately a long-term winning strategy and people need to recognize that profits from altcoins ultimately do have to flow back into Bitcoin that is the sustainable strategy for sure yeah I mean I think Rob I think Rob was talking about this what last week on NFA live we were talking about like what do you do when you get an airdrop and I think what was your strategy like just 50% you take profits on it right away 50% back to bitcoin or USD and then you let there oh no no it was you let let it go up 2X or something or if it goes up 2x then you sell 50% was that what you said yeah I I call it well two things I call it the half and half method so you get into meme coins or something crazy and then let's say you put it you know 100 bucks in and then it goes $200 so then you sell half immediately and you put the other hundred bucks let it ride because that's house money then when it doubles or triples or or quadruples then you take half again or you take two or three or 4X what do you want to do and then you let the ride and you do that until there's no more riding and it just goes away and then you're like well okay I I did 8X but it went to zero so I don't feel so bad because a lot of people just let it go all the way up and all the way down but if you just play with house money there's a reason why like like I I can see people in the in the chats going well this sucks because you know now we're gonna sideways and you know this isn't what I want to be there's a reason why all three of us are pretty much just like on all of our videos on all of our Twitter spaces we're pretty much the same person whether it goes massively up or way way down me's a little bit of excitement but it's because we der risked enough to like well if this happens then we do this if this happens we do that and I think that's where people should would want to be as opposed to just going okay I sold my kidney I hope this memec coin goes up it's one of those things have a plan no matter what and then enjoy your life don't stress about it right I mean have a plan like you know if Bitcoin goes to 50K or even lower so what have a plan if it goes up have a plan I mean it I I think you know I used to navigate crypto without without thinking about like what do I do if this happens I only would navigate it based on one particular outcome I never hedge myself but once I started hedging My Views then it makes things easier you know you're like all right well this is what I think but if I'm wrong I don't want to be you know completely left out of whatever that next trend is um and when I when I get air drops um well I don't I don't really get air drops anymore because I'm not really that active in in the space but when I did when I used to get air drops my strategy was immediately convert half of it to bitcoin at least half to bitcoin and then let whatever else ride because like half the time they would just go to zero anyways um so at least you get some of that value out in inss um why don't we goe and move on because we do have two more questions and then I'd also like to get to audience questions at the end if you post your question now I probably won't see it so maybe wait like 10 minutes and then post it um this is an interesting question and I to be completely honest most people aren't going to care but gold is is one of these things where like it doesn't do anything for like 10 years you know and like if you think about this entire bitcoin's like like it's entire history essentially since 2009 gold has essentially gone nowhere in that in that entire phase but we just saw gold break to new all-time highs and it seems to be a somewhat explosive rally so I'm curious about what your thoughts are on gold um I I often think that people who like gold are are more alike to people who like Bitcoin than they would care to admit I think the main difference is the generation that we are right so if I were born one or two generations ago I probably would have been really into gold you know but because I'm born into more of the digital age I'm more into Bitcoin so I think we're more alike than different um so I'm curious like what your thoughts are on gold here it is now 2300 2400 um max where do you you know do you think that uh this is going to continue I me Silver is also not too far behind it in its own move um and I guess the other question is like why do you think gold is rallying so that's probably the bigger question is is why do you think it's rallying rather than like what do you think it's going to go to sure yeah the gold strength is um pronounced it's very impressive um and and I would say I mean why do people buy gold historically right it's sound money it was sound money before Bitcoin it was a store of value when you know our our parents generation was nervous about the state of the world they would you know convert their into gold and uh you know a lot of it is more of a um it's a mental thing it's a it's a mental insulation it's not like if your country was invaded you're going to put you know 500 pounds of gold on your back and somehow travel to another country right but it's a it's a peace of mind thing you know and you know again historically it is you know a sound currency uh there is a scarcity aspect to it there's a lot of commonality and overlap between gold and Bitcoin and I think everything you mentioned Ben is correct um I would say that my bias on gold um really stems more on my perspective and my my forecast on where I think dxy is headed and similarly where I think Bitcoin is headed I've already shared my opinion on where I think Bitcoin is going we have the Bitcoin having just around the corner um I expect Bitcoin to you Trend upwards aggressively over the next six to nine months subsequently I do believe that dxy is forming a sort of distribute you know a distribution here I do anticipate dxy topping very soon and again if you just overlay gold with dxy on a weekly chart you can see that there is a pretty prominent negative correlation between dxy and gold so I don't think we're I'm not of the opinion that we're going to see a decoupling where there's suddenly a a prolonged period of a positive correlation where gold rallies and dxy rallies I think that one of them is lying so either gold is lying or dxy is lying I think that gold is leading and going to see dxy of course sort of reclaim that negative correlation and begin to take a dive over the next quarter so um I do expect gold to continue upwards and I think it's probably off the back of the you know dxy weakening okay yeah fair enough um it has it has been really strong you know and I I can't help but look at it I'm like wow you have like a 10-year base I the bigger the base the more explosive the rally and for I mean for I know like all the crypto you know Deens are like you know it's up what like 10% or something and like people are like you know like 10% is like a minute candle on a meme coin right but for gold you know for an asset that's that high market cap like that is a big move in a really short period of time and so like that's why it it it means something Rob what are your thoughts here um are you are you are you watching this gold move I'm not watch I mean but I own it I own gold and silver and I I think and I don't I never UND and we talk about this many times I never understood why the old maximalists and this and the precious metal maximalists hate Bitcoin so much because like you said we're trying to all do the same thing we're trying to get out of the Matrix which is relying on paper Fiat and it just seems like I there's there's that one gold bug guy that is what we all talk about for some god- awful reason but in reality I think for the majority of people that are into precious metals I think they can see the value behind it and of of of Bitcoin itself and like I I like I never understood with this guy like why don't we have a debate between that guy and like Mike Maloney Mike Maloney is huge into gold he's put out a great series on precious medals and he's he likes Bitcoin as well so like when I take a look at this I I think you know why why not own why not old gold why not diversify like you know uh we've got I diversify not just in the crypto but the stocks precious metals and and real estate and I think everybody should do the you know kind of do the same thing but to talk about why gold went up so much let me I I don't know but how did gold do in 2022 was there any kind of rally during that time I mean it it it it still mostly stayed below the high I don't really think it did that well um it's only recently really started to show strength I mean I can I can pull it up and see but 2022 was kind of split it rallied in the first half of the year and then didn't really do too much and actually corrected a little bit looks like yeah I mean it looks like it topped in March of 2022 and then basically just went down yeah till November and then it rallied again into December kind of there there's a theory going around about why Gold's rallying so much it's because the Nations that are going to war they are trying they're fearful of us sanctions so how do how do you get away get around those sanctions well you stockpile Alternatives and one of those would be of course gold so people are talking about how Iran could be could have stockpiled after the Damascus situation and the and the bombing and the reason why I ask about 2022 is because for the Ukraine Invasion I think was February 2022 and the same type of thing was being said about Russia stockpiling gold at the same time so I can see I can kind of see that that valuation I don't know why they don't just use Bitcoin it's a heck of a lot easier to transfer and zip around value but that's where we're at yeah I always like I always think those posts by the gold bugs are so disingenuous because I mean like I I own both like I own Bitcoin and gold but like if you go to trading View and you look at the Bitcoin or you look at the Gold valuation against Bitcoin it's down so much since Bitcoin launched that it rounds it to negative 100% like like that's how far the valuation of gold has fallen against Bitcoin since Bitcoin has been around so again like it's not it's just look I mean the the Bitcoin valuation as far exceeded gold for a long time um I mean my guess is over the next 20 years Bitcoin will still outperform gold you know maybe in the short term gold could outperform uh Bitcoin but and I I mean I guess it has been since March right ever since gold broke out Gold's been doing better than even the S&P 500 even the NASDAQ um it's been having my view is that I I I think that gold is breaking out because it senses that um rate cuts are coming sooner than the market is potentially thinking and so that's kind of why I think I I think it's sort of sniffing something out just like it did in 2019 and and um but we'll see I mean you know we'll see if it if it plays out in the same way last question and I mean I you know this is more so geared towards Max um because I mean Rob is I mean you know you've been around here forever we' probably even asked this question you before yeah but I mean if you want to take it if you want to answer you can Max Max yeah so since you're new here um why did you start your YouTube channel I mean like what what was your motivation what are you helping to accomplish with it uh what brings you here well Ben you you actually played a big role in in bringing me here I was a very early follower of yours actually before you even had your website I bought your Google sheet way back in the day and I'm still locked into my original price thank you very much because I got in early pays to get in early um you know I I learned a lot from you in the very beginning and I went through last cycle and you know Ben and and Rob also this you know this is a compliment to both of you guys amongst a sea of grifters and thieves and people looking to prey on unsuspecting retail you know guys like yourselves you you conducted yourselves in a manner that you know I mean I can't even imagine how many millions of dollars you guys turn down from shill deals and you know crap like that and you know I I wanted to in the beginning play my you know play my part in that I felt as though I had opinions that you know um I could share something to offer I have you know I have an ability to lead I have you know an ability to organize a team um and I wanted to play my my part my equal share in the sort of collective hive mind of you know CT and and YouTube and help educate that's sort of the underpinning of of what I'm doing is I like to teach I like to collaborate and you know making money certainly feels nice right but there's a certain there's a certain sense of fulfillment that I personally get out of somebody messaging me saying hey because of what you said it made a difference in my life and something clicked for me and that feels really good and you know I I started because Bitcoin and it was it's a small Channel still um we're growing quickly certainly which of course if you go to Ben's beautiful website and you overlay social media growth with uh you know the price of Bitcoin you can see why I'm starting to grow quicker it's it's I'm doing the same thing I was doing all bare Market it's just suddenly more people care about crypto so um you know I am a i a result of good times and I pray that they continue on because of course it's you know a nice Tailwind for for my young business but yeah I mean really to answer the question Point Blank I love to teach I love to to collaborate and I love to debate you know like I have a differing opinion than you know you guys for some things and there's some overlap but that's what makes a market beautiful is that you can think one thing I can think another and we can come together and just talk about it politely and nobody knows what's going to happen right like we can't I have my hunch I have conviction just like you guys do but Bitcoin dominance could go to 90% And you know even over flip it and put that on on Twitter don't do that don't do that or or it could literally nuke down to 10% we could have like the crypto equivalent of the NASDAQ bubble between 1995 and 2000 where altcoins bubble like people you know can't imagine everybody's thrown money at altcoins speculating anything that's crypto and then 99 out of 100 of them don't exist in a couple years you know so who who knows what's going to happen but yeah I love to to collaborate and teach and debate and uh generally it's it's just a passion of mine how many subscribers are you guys at now like 13 14k or something yes on YouTube somewhere in between there yeah well there's 3,600 people watching so if everyone here goes and clicks the link in the description below and goes over to Max's Channel and subscribes then uh I I'm sure he would appreciate that and I think he deserves that he's been they've been putting out they it's not just Max by the way I mean it's a team of people um so go check that out you guys do like daily live streams right we Yeah we actually have a show coming up at uh 10:00 a.m. eastern time we do a Daily Show we've got a panel of Five Guys we're all just Traders wrap this one up then if you got it coming up in 10 minutes that's okay I got a big team they got it all right well before we before we end it here I I did want to take at least a couple of questions um and one of the questions I saw was um what is the best way to learn about crypto and to do your own research so I mean I don't know if they're talking about like from a fundamental perspective but I if someone were getting into crypto like like what do you guys use to do your research and I mean and maybe talk about like all the different tool or some at least some of the bigger tools that you guys have been using especially for all the different things that are happening in the cryptoverse there seems like there's a thousand different narratives that you could you know that you could follow and whoever wants to take that one is fine go ahead Max yeah um I would start on uh one of our three channels I think that's a really good place not to not to spew the obvious but um I would say I would say learn to do very basic ta right and understand Cycles like there's some very awesome free indicators out there like I mean you can even just look at like you know Ben has a a you he's kind of coined a very famous one he's combined a 20 week SMA and a 21 we EMA which has been sort of uh marketed as the bull market band for good reason right so you can determine when you know Bitcoin is trending upwards High time frame or trending down by just a simple you moving average band there's also things like the P Cycle top which I think people should keep an eye on which is again a free trading view indicator someone someone made it it's also on Ben's website there's also some some good onchain stuff like you know Bitcoin terminal price hoddle waves things like that I would as a beginner I would stay off the hourly time frame like literally just go daily time frame and above um and whenever you see Bitcoin down you know 50% from its its all-time high that's time to start paying attention to maybe consider entering the market but you know learn very very basic ta and and some of the more popular onchain indicators can really help you just DCA at the right time you know but stay off of the hourly time frames mainly the py cycle top just to give credit is uh was developed by Philip Swift um a while back and I the the idea was to predict the top with within 3 days and it did a really great job of doing that in the first uh the first 2021 Peak um and it actually happened I remember it happening and like no one really believed it you know um but I think it was retrofit right it was fit after yeah it was created in 2019 it was created in 2019 okay but it did it did get the first top in 2021 I feel like a lot of these like metrics that everyone created in 2019 uh it they called the first top but then most of them like didn't really call the second top because it was just sort of like a it was like a dead cat bounce that just somehow made it to New highs you know yeah um so yeah that was kind of an interesting one um Rob did you have anything to add just yeah just one thing Max makes all great points the thing I would say is that if you really knew you really really knew you have to understand that it's not how much you make it's how much you keep and the big thing is that you have to watch out for scams and things to watch out for and if you're gonna get into like hot storage wallets stuff like that there's a there's a video in the in the link of in the description of all my videos and it says you know things you the the big mistakes in crypto and it has like 20,000 views and of course it's the most important video I probably have ever put out because that's what people get screwed out and they get scammed out and if they watch that video they wouldn't happen to them another video I did when I'm gonna sell on my crypto has over 100,000 views so it just goes to show you like where the priorities are the priorities are make money but really the priority should be keep money someone's asking a um this the Market's not pricing it in right now but I did see like last night there's been a couple of times here where like there's at least some in investors like thinking about a rate hike um that is not like my base case at all like I think they're done I I think five and a half percent is the terminal rate for this cycle they might go higher next cycle uh but I I think five and a half percent at the top I'm not going to ask you if you think they're gonna hike again because I don't really think any of us think they're going to um if you do think that let me know but I guess my main question is what do you think would happen if they did hike again um because that be I mean that would talk about markets not pricing it in right I mean like I guess the the implication would be like if if the economy just accelerates into you know again and and there's not a cool down and we just keep on moving up uh what would a rate what would another rate hike do well what was real quick what was what is what has Jerome Powell said about fighting inflation do they say that they're on the right track or do they say like there's it's more more stubborn what he they've kind of like the progress has slowed a lot and I I think they've kind of specul that it it might influence their the number of rate Cuts this year because previously they had said three rate Cuts this year and I'm I'm wondering if they're starting to walk I mean now the market is pricing in only two rate cuts through April of 2025 so I my view is that you know I thought higher for longer but now that everyone else believes it I think I think it's going to go back the other way because once the market fully prices in no rate Cuts that's when people give up and you need to start having some rate cuts um but yeah I don't know I mean pal Po's basically said the same thing he said for the last three years if you know they're they're going to keep rates higher for longer until inflation's durably going back to 2% yeah I I think that 3% is is the new 2% truthfully I I I appreciate their narrative and their consistency and and how they haven't wavered on that and I think it's a great goal um but it seems like three is kind of a magnet actually a little above three um like you mentioned they are currently pricing in now it looks like you know our first 25 basis point cut on the uh September 18th meeting and then through April 2025 and and these percentages change all the time right uh you know we'll see what happens um you know potentially taking us down 50 basis points off of where we're currently at um let me answer your question what would happen if we got another 25 basis point hike because you know inflation decides it's going to rear its ugly head again and and start trending up above you know headline four 5% God forbid it's over I mean like we are going to absolutely nuke if we get another rate I'm gonna be as as clear as I can be if we get another rate hike markets are going to capitulate like that will be awful horrible for risk like sell all of your assets honestly like if that happens I'm not joking I think it'd be terrible I don't know if you guys agree with me but that would be horrible for markets but I don't think that's going to happen to be clear I think you could have the same thing happen if they just refuse to cut soon enough too because like it it you know like a tightening cycle is not just raising rates but it's also keeping rates too high for too long and the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and eight would have been in March um so we've already gone nine I think there's still you know there's still a window where talks about a soft Landing right it's so hard to thread that needle to a soft Landing because you have to stay high enough to make sure inflation doesn't come back in a second wave because if you don't and you get an inflation a secondary wave like the 70s you get a hard Landing but if you stay high for too long like let's say they stay at five and a half percent for another six months then you start to run the risk of of a deflationary crash right so that's why everyone sort of rolls their eyes about a soft Landing is because it's so difficult to thread that needle and I don't I do not envy their job I I do not envy their job because it's not and and they're also operating with long and variable lags like how can they know all the effects of prior monetary policy um so yeah it's it's a tough place for them to be and and we are oh sorry Rob go ahead no no go ahead Max I was going to say you know we are seeing some smaller economies in my opinion forecasting when our rate cuts are coming like we have seen the Czech Republic actually start to cut we've seen Poland cut um so it you know historically it's not perfect right but you are starting to see some of these smaller countries actually they they LED through the hik so they began to hike first they paused first and they've actually started to cut so I I do anticipate that you know in similar fashion to what has happened historically we will see the US begin to I guess cut rates hopefully uh later this year um but I do agree with you Ben like if they held rates where they're currently at through you know all of 2024 that would also put some pressure um on our economy and our markets but with that said like I don't know what you you guys think but I mean really the the final you know real dagger or Domino to fall is going to be of course unemployment creeping up above four four and a half percent do you guys think that if they just held rates where they're currently at all through 2024 um but we didn't see the labor market really deteriorate could financial markets hold up in that instance I mean if if the labor market doesn't deteriorate sure I just think that um I mean it seems like the unemployment rate is trending up um and the the problem with with that is that it doesn't tend to move in a linear fashion right it it goes slow and then it starts to accelerate at some point and we haven't reached the acceleration phase right so there's still a chance that we can avoid it but the longer they wait the the the riskier that's going to be I think I think there's a higher probability of a rate cut this summer than the market is giving credit for I don't think it has to happen this summer but I think the right thing to do is to cut at least 25 basis points uh this summer 50 basis points something like that just uh provide something you know are you thinking in the June meeting or July meeting I mean look last cycle I know that that the altcoin market was a lens into the consumer and I know that that when alts broke down against Bitcoin and when eth broke down against Bitcoin the FED basically cut one month later um and we we have seen eth fall against Bitcoin it had a weekly close below the June low we saw madic Bitcoin uh crash below it's June 2022 low we've seen adaa Bitcoin and Dot bit coin we've seen Litecoin Bitcoin and a Bitcoin I mean so many of these altcoins are are falling off their Bitcoin support levels and you can see it with the Bitcoin dominance so I think that the pricing out of all these rate Cuts is going to cause them to get priced in because the FED does not base their decisions on what our altcoins are doing right un they don't care what I what I what I find unfortunate is that a lot of the small like companies like Mom and Pop shops a lot of them are going out of business business right now because you know rates are going up and and and times are getting harder like inflation is so high so people just can't afford as much and but the FED has to do it because all of us Deens in the in the space can't help ourselves from bidding up jpegs you know and and and leading inflation uh to to where it was so I think that it's it's kind of a tough spot to be and the FED has to stay long enough to kind of break the animal spirits but if they do it too long then you then then you run the other issue of of a deflationary um unwind and that's not really fun either I know like people are like oh I'd love to go to the store and not spend as much money but if you if prices go down that's probably not good for risk assets terrible just yeah so everybody everybody who's watching the videos remember this when when you think like okay the Bitcoin Market or the crypto Market has to do this thing it has to do this thing because it's it's been the cycle that's always done this doesn't actually work like what we just talked about just how fragile the markets actually are and just to think how things have to really go in line before you realize that oh maybe I should have taken some profits when there was uh everything was overheated just it's just something to think about because I hate people who roundtrip and uh they really should again take some profits when everything gets too hot and and one thing just to mention about rate cuts and I mean you guys probably know this rate Cuts inherently are not bearish right it's it's the underpinning as to why they are cutting rates and you know if you actually on a granular level you go and you overlay the effective federal funds rate with you know the NASDAQ or S&P 500 markets actually tend to rally for like 30 to 60 days give or take following the First Rate cut until they wake up and they realize oh crap there's economic deterioration under the surface which is why they're cutting rates and then we see these major Corrections so I think whether the first 25 basis point comes in June or the end of July meeting or I guess hopefully September um that's probably your 30 to 60-day warning truthfully whenever it comes and I don't know when it will and what about no go ahead I was going to say you're right I mean like the rate Cuts inherently are are are bullish for risk assets if they're cutting for the right reasons in 2019 while Bitcoin topped out when rate Cuts arrived the S&P 500 kept going up and you know because the mark like the the economy was not in a recession right it wasn't going into a recession they were sort of like preliminary rate Cuts You could argue that Bitcoin is more tied to financial markets today traditional markets today than it was back then because of the spot ETF so maybe it would track the S&P 500 a bit closer than it did last cycle once rate Cuts arrive but the issue is why the FED is cutting are they cutting because they're trying to get ahead of something bad that's coming or are they cutting as a reactionary thing because they just saw a really bad labor market prance and that is is when they're not bullish like that's when rate cuts are be so it all depends on Max is right it all depends on why they're cutting and and I think that it's also risky to I I I do believe that there's just as much risk to the UPS side truthfully where you know assuming that they're going to cut because there is severe economic deterioration can also be you know a very harmful strategy long term because like you mentioned the first batch of rate cuts that we saw in 2019 um you know the S&P 500 rallied out of those cuts like 15% and then of course we had our Co nuke in March which took us below you know where that that first uh cut occurred right but you know again it's like you have to be very careful you kind of threading your own needle per se because just because they're cutting doesn't mean sell everything right because they could cut you know the labor market could be more resilient than anybody's expecting the S&P 500 could go up 50% over the next year and then something bad happens and you get a correction but that correction doesn't take you down to as low as the point in which the first cut happens so you just have to be a little bit careful truthfully you know you have to really understand why they're cutting and and it's a tough thing to do it's very tough I me with the S&P you know there there's been all sorts of like crises throughout all the decades but if you just pull up a chart over a 100 years I mean you know the the the overall trend is clear you know um the markets generally go up because the money supply yeah yeah you know why did prices of houses go up 40% because the supply of money went up 40 per. you know it's not it's not I it's not really that complicated so yeah no I mean I think like as always right like time in the market often beats time the market um because it's impossible to to actually time the market for under most circumstances and I think sometimes people get lucky with it and then assume that they're like a genius and can do it again and again and again um but the reality is that the market will humble us all at some point why don't we go ahead and wrap it up there um we we'll have NFA live back I guess next week next week I think it'll be on Rob's Channel um so we'll see you guys over there next week and again if you're not subscribed uh to to Max or Rob links for their channels are in the description

      "Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin the having approaches if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe crypto.com links in the description below make sure you guys check that out we're going to end the sale after the having sometime this weekend I don't know exactly when but I would go ahead and get it now if you want the subscription at the lower rate before we jump in I I would like to say thank you to everyone who is a subscriber here I like to kind of take a step back when I hit these major milestones and just say you know I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing it means the world to be at 800,000 subscribers you know when I started the channel I had no idea that it it would grow to be this big uh but here we are and I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing to the channel and I know I don't get everything right and I I do get things wrong um but I do appre appreciate you guys sticking with me uh either way so I just wanted to to acknowledge that and to say thank you to everyone for being a subscriber also the the having is is almost here and in fact by the time you watch this video the having's probably already happened um I'll try to get the video out here uh in a in a in you know 30 minutes or so um if we take a look when it's going to occur at least from when I'm recording this video it's going to be about 5 hours um but by the time you're watching this video it's probably going to be a lot less and it could already be behind us if you go look at the um at the the how many blocks it looks like we only have about 30 blocks to go so it is coming up really really soon and I I just think it's such a big event I'm going to try to live stream it that's my goal is to try to live stream the event uh it is in about again 5 hours it's going to be a little tricky cuz that's going to sort of correspond with some uh bedtime routines for my kids uh but I will try to to to live stream it if I can uh so do look out for that here in the next four or I guess by the time you're watching this video it'll be a different time but ideally I'm going to try to get get on here live by 8:30 Eastern um is my goal but again no promises so Bitcoin is is currently at at 64k we're going to keep this pretty short um because I mean you guys know my thoughts on the market but I do just want to say you know there there's a couple of different scenarios that could play out and I'm sure you've seen me talk about him a thousand times you've probably seen everyone else talk about him a thousand times the the sort of the two main short-term things so sort of the most likely outcomes in the short term are either you go straight to the 20we SMA following the habing or you get a bounce first to go just north of the 8 week moving average and then you resolve to a a lower low in May um off of off of whatever low this is you know so those are the sort of the two most likely shortterm outcomes to me again I I don't know which one will play out I I could certainly find evidence for both I will say you know with the S&P 500 at its own bull market support ban I I really do Wonder like well if if the S&P can go to it 20we SMA why can't Bitcoin you know I mean it's been a long time and with the S&P it had been really since November since it had been at its 20we SMA and now it's there once again and I wonder like you know with Bitcoin what's to keep it from going to its own 20we SMA it hasn't seen it since really mid October so if the S&P 500 can go there why can't Bitcoin in fact it's not even just the S&P if you were to look at at eth you can see it's been wicking down to its 20we moving average already you can see the riskier assets are already hitting it um if you look at at total three you can see that it's already been wicking down to its bull market support band so as you go you know further up the risk curve it's easier for those assets to hit that 20we SMA because when Bitcoin sneezes the the the altcoin market gets annihilated and you can see that I mean Bitcoin is still well above its 20we moving average in fact I mean in fact for it to go to its 20we SMA it would require about another 15 % drop from the current prices the problem with that for things like eth and and alts is that if Bitcoin were to do that then they likely go below their bull market support bands and this is exactly what we saw in 2019 right we saw eth go below its bull market support band after that local top just after eth Bitcoin broke down before Bitcoin did so that when Bitcoin bounced off of its 20we ese in the short term even didn't hold it as support eventually it bounced off of it ethusd basically just held resistance at the bull market support band so I I do think there there's some some reason to think it could play out like that you know as much as there there very well could be sort of a relief into late April early May um just keep an eye on on the 20we SME because you know the hard part with it is that you know you can look at at at prior local tops right you can look at things like 2021 and and 2019 and see that they had these rallies back up to the 8-week moving average on their first weekly close below the 8we moving average right so the first weekly close below the 8we right here in 2019 we rallied right back above the 8we and then formed a lower high in 2021 right same type of thing right go below the 8 we and then rally on back up the thing is is like we could see a weekly close below the 8we but we haven't necessarily even seen it yet also note that in 2019 after you had that rally back above the 8we it was after a 34% drop you know at this time Bitcoin has really only dropped about the same amount that it has been about 20% right I mean you know as much as it might feel like it's it's been more brutal this time that's only because the altcoin market is getting hammered but that's what alts do best in you know when Bitcoin sneezes alts get annihilated so you can see that so far this is a pretty standard drop for Bitcoin right 20% nothing too different from what we've seen um but do note that while it is 20% the the rally back to the 8we SMA in 2019 occurred after it had gone down you know closer to 30% which would actually get you near that 20we moving average so it's really hard to say and and while it is convenient of course to compare to 2019 and early 21 because you know I'm sure everyone would like that rally back up to the8 week SMA there's also other examples uh like like 20 late 2021 where you get something like this where you you know you're putting in these weekly closes where the Wicks are lower right you can see that right the Wicks are lower there as well just like they were over here um but you ended up just getting a capitulation down right so there's no guarantee right there's no guarantee with the market and I think like I I think honestly we're not going to you know next week will be sort of the decision point on on if you're going to bounce off of it or not um this week I imagine it's not going to you know we're not going to fully know I mean this you know it's already Friday anyways but yeah I I think it's just I mean it's certainly interesting because you're not only looking at at Bitcoin sort of slowly fading back in uh but you can see that a lot of other markets are as well right like the S&P is down to its bull market support band eth is down to its bull market support band or at least it has been wicking there it's not there at the current moment but it has been for the last couple of days off and on and then you have some altcoins that are below their 20we SMA already right I mean um I'm sure a lot of them are right I don't know if link is yeah link is Ada is Litecoin is not surprisingly madic is um dot is I mean a lot of them are already below their Market sport band so you can see that like the stronger assets are still above it Bitcoin is still above it right now but you know I I look at these other markets you know even the Russell the Russell is below it right so this is a great example of how the S&P is at the 20 we but the Russell is below it so you could see something happen very very similar in crypto where Bitcoin goes to its 20 we and when it does if and when it does then maybe alts go below it right that could could very well play out sometime after the having whether you get a rally to the 8we SMA or not right and again I don't know um if we're going to go to the 8 week ese next week or if it's going to be like you know a month later I could easily come up with a reason for either scenario easily easily it it's going to depend on what your bias is um so I I really I really can confidently say I don't know which one's going to play out but I will say that regardless of whether you get a relief to the 8we or not my expectation is that Bitcoin will go to the 20we moving average within the next few weeks right you know within probably either this month or next month is my guess I mean it's been a long time right I mean it seems like we're due for it in 2019 you know it it took about 25 weeks you know something like that in you know 2020 or so all the way through 2021 we fell back into it in in May in fact and that was about 32 weeks we're currently at what 26 weeks right so my guess is you know sometime in the next 6 weeks we're going to find ourselves at the bull market support band and then we'll see what's up again my guess is that if if Bitcoin sort of chops around in this range for a few months that's what should send the Bitcoin dominance to 60% right so if it goes down to the 20e Ese and then it bounces back up for a little bit to the 8we ese or vice versa goes to the a week first and then goes to the 20 week it's that chopping process that should break the altcoin market down and I mean you can see it already happening you know with eth Bitcoin which is something we've been following you know for a long time you know it's now at 0482 now it is you know talking about this sort of stuff on the the sort of the cusp of a major Bitcoin event you know there could be counter Trend rallies for this stuff but again you know my guess is that eth Bitcoin is is just sort of doing something like this after breaking down where it it sort of TR to hold on for a week but inevitably it keeps on bleeding into into the summer months where maybe it finally can potentially bottom so that is my view here going into into the having remember if there is a larger drop in the crypto verse uh following the having whether it's immediately after or whether it's delayed by a few weeks one thing to remember right one thing that I I I think you should remember is that when you measure things from the peak and you go Peak to Peak Bitcoin is ahead of schedule by a lot right it really is it can afford to give back a lot of that and still be in line with prior Cycles we've said that forever this is why I've said Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio because it's going to outperform the altcoin marketing till QE Returns the problem for alts you know I'll tell you the problem for alts is that if Bitcoin just drops back down here to get back in line with the prior Cycles just like last cycle it dropped back in line to get to get back in line with its prior cycle if Bitcoin drops here to get back in line with the last two cycles guess what alts can go back down to their lows or they can put in new lows because they're not that far off of their lows to begin with whereas Bitcoin is right you know Bitcoin is already well off its low whereas the alts a lot of them are not now some of them are but a lot of most of them are not really that far off of their low so I mean you know if you see a situation where Bitcoin just simply goes back to where it you know where it was in the last two cycles at this point that's how the altcoin market can put in you know a lot of alts can put in new lows even in the having year and we saw that happen last cycle as well and and I know there's always going to be some type of reason for it or justification or rationalization but that is just what I've seen you know cycle after cycle after cycle is that alts can get that bounce in the prehab year but inevitably as you get later on in the business cycle and we get you know as the Market is really starting to digest all those rate hikes and and the FED refusing to Pivot sufficiently that's where alts you know the order books are thin and that's where they just continue to slowly bleed uh not only on their USD pairs but also their Bitcoin Pairs and then my guess is that once you start getting multiple weekly closes by Bitcoin below its 20we moving average I think there's a good chance that at that point Bitcoin dominance has topped but between now and then I think that you're going to see it you're going to see Bitcoin USD sort of chop around in this range for a couple of months um and during that time I I think the Bitcoin dominance will go uh to 60% as eth Bitcoin goes to 003 to 04 and and all Bitcoin pairs go all the way back down from 0 42 to where they currently are down to about .25 best case scenario and that's if you want to say that they're oscillators right so back down to 0.25 or so so that is is really my view right now on the market um there are also sort of other views that you could look at that sort of revolve around if it wants to follow some of the prior you know the prior Trends with some major geopolitical events we did see Bitcoin over here you know put in some scary Wicks back in early 2022 um and then they still swept the local high after that so there is always a chance that something like that happens as well um so be ready for anything uh but I I do think that the market would greatly benefit from a a summer lull where it just kind of gets boring for a little while and all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out that's what I think would be the best case for the cryptoverse is a a summer where all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out because no one cares anymore you know all the hype is behind us and then then you start to see them find their true lows on their Bitcoin pairs you know for everyone who is who's laughed at the idea of the devaluation of all Bitcoin pairs they just put in a new low last week right they just put in a new new low last week so don't laugh at it I mean this is just what happened last cycle you know it's just exactly what happened and and if they do come back down here like over here then I I think there's no debating anymore that it it really is following sort of what 2019 was it's just that the reason why it was delayed until the having year was because rate Cuts occur potentially now in the having year as opposed to the preh having year like last cycle so to me it all looks like it's playing out in a very similar manner where all Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows just before rate Cuts arrive the onset of rate Cuts potentially as early as this summer should allow a Bitcoin pairs to bottom out and then a USD pairs can find whatever low they're going to find um based on how how low Bitcoin goes and then perhaps by the last rate cut uh then you start to see it go the other way the biggest Counterpoint to all these views is if it's a um you know if we just get some manic blowoff top or something this summer uh following some type of left translated cycle I mean you could have a left translated cycle where the top is is March right I mean that's what happened in the dot crash right I mean that the top was in March of the election year that's not really my base case though um but I I would say I would say that if you are to get a left translated cycle where Bitcoin just goes parabolic into all the um into all the bad news and everything then you know then that would sort of invalidate the views that I'm expressing um my base case though is that we are just simply repeating what we saw uh back over here and all Bitcoin pairs should come down as we get into this summer and and by you know maybe by June July something like that I I could see all Bitcoin pairs finally bottoming out not withstanding Maybe some future Bitcoin parabolic rally which we saw over here but that is is you know really my view on the market right now and we will see if it if it continues to pan out or not in the meantime bitcoin's at 64k um and we'll see if it if it goes to the 20we estimate in the next couple of weeks or if instead it first rallies back up to just above or just around its 8we moving average um uh first but either way I do think we are due for a test of the bullmark sport band here in the next you know month month and a half if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the crypts premium at intothe crypto.com we have tons of charts thousands of different charts for a lot of different cryptocurrencies if there's a lot of cryptocurrencies that you have that you wish I spoke about or you wish you could see the charts for those cryptocurrencies we have a lot of them on the website you know a lot of people call me a Bitcoin Maxi how many Bitcoin Maxis have website a website with thousands of charts for altcoins right so I I'm not I just I I'm I I put my maxi hat on when Bitcoin dominance is in a macro uptrend and I I don't really think you should blame me for that um but do check it out links in the description below that sale will end uh this weekend after the having so make sure you lock in the low rate between now and then and I will see you guys uh hopefully tonight for the uh for the live stream of the having which is only a few hours from now but I can't make any promises that I'll be there it's going to depend on on how some uh some of the family stuff goes but I will do my best to be there to live stream the having anyways I'll see you guys next time bye\n",

      "Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the having if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom the sale will be ending just after the having so make sure you check it out and lock in the lower rate let's go ahead and jump in the Bitcoin having is probably one of the most significant events in our industry I often find people debating every cycle you know whether the having is priced in or not whether it has an effect on pric or not my view is that you know we've had three having before we had one in 2012 one in 2016 and of course one in 2020 and I I certainly do think that the having does play a role in the cycles of the crypto verse um I also think that monetary policy plays a role but I don't really fall in either Camp completely I don't think that it's only based on supply side stuff and I don't think it is only based on you know monetary policy I think it's a combination of of different things markets are complex um they're they're based on a lot of different things and so because the having is one of the most important events I wanted to do a video where we talk about it and talk about where where I have previously said that theit the price of Bitcoin may be now price predictions are honestly something that I'm not super into um because usually you know usually price predictions don't really turn out that great if if you put in a price prediction and it goes above it then you know the comments aren't so nice and if you put a price prediction and we don't quite get there you know people are also upset but I wanted to to revisit something that I said four years ago and kind of see like where are we with respect to that so four years ago I put out this video Bitcoin Fair valuation at the next tabing in 2024 I put out this video in 2020 in May of 2020 the price of Bitcoin was around $8,000 and what I said back then was that if we follow the fair value logarithmic regression trend line then by the fourth having which is the having that's about to occur the price to bitcoin would be between 40 to $50,000 okay that's what I said back then clearly we are above that price right clearly if we go back and look at the video that I put out a year ago or no this was at the end of 2022 um or mid 2022 just before the the the um the final collapse occurred I also sort of Drew it out going to around a 40 to 50K so with Bitcoin right now at 63k it's ahead right I mean there's no denying it it's ahead of where I said it was going to be back then now of course back then putting out a price prediction four years later um and and hoping that it would be accurate at all was probably something I was fairly naive about uh but here we are 4 years later and the price of Bitcoin is actually above the target range that I put and it's also above this area that I put as well going into the having and so with that in mind I I want to discuss a couple of things that that may come up after the having um that could very well uh take some people by surprise now there's a lot of different thoughts to this current cycle with it being you know so hot at this point in the cycle we've never seen the market put in new highs before the having right this is the first time ever that Bitcoin has put in new highs before the having and so that was you know probably one of the reasons why back then I I didn't think it would be quite so high but we are at new highs before the having and so I just want to talk about what you know what to potentially expect after the happing now there's two different trends of thought here one of which is a left translated Peak okay now to be completely honest I'm not really in the left translated Peak camp but it does have like maybe 40% of my attention and the reason for that is if you were to take the ROI of Bitcoin from Peak to Peak and you take it from the April Peak Peak instead of the November 2021 Peak and you compare it to last cycle it sort of looks like it potentially could form into a peak sooner rather than later in which case you would get a left translated top meaning the the the actual top occurs way before anyone thinks it will historically Bitcoin has topped out in the fourth quarter of the post having year so if you look at Major Peaks that Bitcoin has had in the past if I were to get an arrow here you can see that this top was in Q4 of the post having year this one was in Q4 of the post having year and this one was in Q4 of the posst having Year we're currently in Q2 of the having year so you know that is is still about six quarters away when Bitcoin typically tops but again so far this cycle is anything but typical with Bitcoin putting in new before the having so if it is to translate into a left translated Peak a left translated cycle then it would be more likely that the top would occur in 2024 as opposed to 2025 if we are going to follow that then I have to imagine that we would follow potentially what happened last cycle now it's not really my base cas but again it would be foolish not to at least acknowledge the similarities but on the other hand where I would say 60% of my attention is right now is what if this cycle is just like prior cycles and we are all over here jumping through hoops trying to explain why this time is different when potentially it just Peaks when it normally does and one way that we could go about getting to that point would be that if we had a cool off in the summer okay now there's no guarantee and if we follow this path then you might see the exact opposite of a summer lull but if there is a summer lull then one thing to keep in mind when you look at the last two cycles as measured Peak to Peak you can see that at this point in the cycle Bitcoin was only up or it was it was actually still about 60% down from its all-time high now I want you to think about that for a minute in both prior Cycles at this point as measured Peak to Peak Bitcoin was 60% below the all-time high 60% below it now right now Bitcoin is not 60% below the prior high in fact 60% below the prior High would put Bitcoin all the way down at around $26,000 that's how accelerated we are this cycle look at the last cycle 60% down from that Peak you can see that by May of 2020 that was when the having occurred Bitcoin was down 60% from the high and then if you go back to the cycle before that this the that the having occurred in July if I remember correctly and if you go to July of 2016 you will see that Bitcoin was approximately down 60% from the high this having it's not right it's not 60% down from the high in fact it is at the high it's at the high which has never happened before so this has caused a lot of people to view this cycle as different from the prior ones and I have to tell you they make a fair point they make make a fair point and if you measure it from the April top you can kind of see that Bitcoin is doing just about what it always does at this point in the cycle if you take the April top as the more important top and of course there is evidence to suggest that the April top is the more important top for instance some of that evidence to suggest the April top is the more important top is to look at views to a lot of different cryptocurrency YouTube channels and to note that there were more views in the first half of 2021 than there were in the second half where Bitcoin basically just put in a lower high in terms of social activity but somehow a higher high in terms of price if you look at Bitcoin with respect to its 50e moving average one of the things that it does after every major cycle top is that it goes back down to the 50 we and then gets a bounce a dead cap bounce before ultimately capitulating we saw that happen over here as well go back to the 50 we get a dead bounce and then go all the way down this past cycle we did not see that exactly what happened was we went back to the 50 we and instead of it just being a dead cap bounce to a lower high which is what potentially that would have been we ended up getting a higher high which took a lot of people off guard now I was optimistic of a higher high but honestly I think because of for for wrong reasons you know and sometimes you get things right for the wrongs reasons and and it's important to take that into consideration so we can see that that happened right we can see that we went to the 50 we we got a bounce but that time it actually led to a higher high the even the intermediate bull market in 2019 had us bouncing off the 50 week at some point and so the 50 we today is at around 40K it's at 39.2k 39.3k which is interesting because again that is way below the current prices way below current prices and I have to imagine that if we do not evolve into a left translated top if we do not right so there's two op you know there's two options right we evolve into a left translated top where the peak occurs in 2024 or we evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 if we're going to evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 you really need to see Bitcoin cool off for a while and again as measured Peak to Peak you can see just how far quote unquote ahead of schedule this cycle is it's actually not that unfamiliar when you think about it the reason it seems like this time is different is because Bitcoin is at new all-time Highs but if you look at the last cycle there was a period where it too was well above its prior cycle but what eventually happened is it bled back down and basically got in line with the prior cycle and then still ended up showing diminishing returns okay and then it actually got ahead of that cycle again this is why a lot of people thought we were going to go to 300 K last cycle but it still was diminishing returns so I want to continue to put forth this idea that if we do not evolve into a left translated Peak sometime around the having and instead the market cools off going into the summer then you might just see something like this where it causes the cycle to just get back in line with prior Cycles now that of course could make a lot of people think that the cycle that the peak is over and and the Bull Run is is is completely done and and maybe they're right right but there is at least some evidence to suggest that that could be what is ultimately in store for us as we get lat into the cycle if you're not familiar with how the last cycle worked and why we what what happened when we bled back down here there's a number of things that really put Bitcoin back into a intermediate bare Market sort of you had a a quantitative tightening bull market and then a bare Market as rate Cuts arrived and then a QE bull market that topped in 2025 now take a a look at Bitcoin this cycle and see how it's doing something very very similar in the sense that it's had this major run during High interest rates you can see it's had this run during High interest rates and in fact if you were to look very closely at when the FED paused here and compare it to this you can see something very similar happened right it it fell just after the FED paused here it fell just after the FED paused and then it went up quite a lot but ultimately what happened is that it it found a local top as just before rate Cuts arrived and then it bled for a while before getting another bull run into the post having year now by the way the having is only four four days away so if we do come up and put in a new local high before the having or maybe around the having that still doesn't necessarily invalidate the idea of the market cooling off sometime after the having if the left translated Peak is not going to occur okay so again there's two thoughts you have a left translated Peak where us Deens just can't help ourselves and everyone just front run runs everything until until the consumer caves or the other idea which would support the idea of this time not being different would just for the cycle to get back in line now if the cycle gets back in line then maybe this view from four years ago of around a you know 40 to 50K Bitcoin by the fourth having isn't that far off I know right now if we were to go back to 40 to 50 okay it would probably feel like the world's falling apart for a lot of people but one thing to consider is that when when e I'm you know I don't know how I made it this far in the video without talking about it one thing to consider last cycle is that the 30% drop Bitcoin had pretty shallow drops during this QT bull market right pretty shallow drops and then eventually it finally got a 30% drop that 30% drop corresponded precisely to the point when eth Bitcoin broke down and eth Bitcoin just broke down below the summer 2022 low so if you were to get a 30% drop sometime after the having that would actually put you kind of right around that range that we said way back over here and in addition to that it would also get you Loosely backed in line with where the prior Cycles were so going into this Bitcoin having is certainly different in the sense that we've never seen a new all-time high before the habing if you were to go look at the risk metric of Bitcoin you will see that the risk on bitcoin has never been this High going into the having in fact the last time we went into the the the 20 when we went into the 2020 having the risk of Bitcoin was at 04 when you look at the 2016 having in July of 2016 the risk on bitcoin was 0.4 today the Bitcoin risk is6 so it's actually quite a bit higher than it was during the last two 3 to4 this time we find ourselves at 639 and only a few weeks ago the risk was in the 7 to8 risk band to give you an idea of what the 04 risk band would look like which is where we were going into the last two that's where the 04 to 0.5 wristband is that's where the price of Bitcoin was at the last two Habs and you can see actually that Bitcoin when those rate Cuts arrived right here had that correction back to the 100 we moving average now what's fascinating about that is that it would correspond to the prior breakout zone so I I I feel like there's two different ways that we can look at the market here here that make the most amount of sense number one is that this is not different from the prior cycles and we're kind of on track with where we should be and that could be viewed by maybe looking at the ROI after the after the low if you look at the ROI after the low and you compare this cycle with two cycles ago this is exactly where we were but you can see that it at this point it did cool off for a while and then did get a drop kind of um you know this was day 520 or so about you know a month and a half from now or so so you can view it like that or you can view it from the peak and still say we're where we should be based on uh based on measuring it from the April top right if you take this out Peak to Peak if you measure it from the April top we're pretty much where we should be but again I can't help but think are we are we are we doing the same thing again where everyone tries to come up with a reason for why this time is different but in reality it's not so my thought process on the matter is this as we go into the Bitcoin having if Bitcoin accelerates into the having and post having and into June right if it is something like that where you know over here in 2019 in fact before rate Cuts arrived it actually did rally in until June last year we had a a local top in April but then we swept the high in June if we get something like that where Bitcoin continues to go up throughout the summer then I would be more in tune with the idea of a left translated top where you get a top in 2024 as opposed to say 2025 however on the other hand if you get a low Top by Bitcoin here as rate Cuts arrive and then instead of you know and that could still include sweeping the prior high right but if you get a look kind of like we did over here with the spot ETF we we put in a new high on the day of the spot ETF for the cycle if on the other hand we see the market cool off into the summer and go to say the 04 to 0.5 wristband or even the 0. 3 to point4 wristband and we get the market more back in line with the prior two cycles then I I think that perhaps the base case should still be that the cycle is playing out just as it always has and you still could get a top in in late 2025 and in fact it was this very intermediate bare Market that kind of scared a lot of people off in fact what happens if something like that happens again where rate Cuts arrive and you go back down scares a lot of people off and then because everyone gets scared off the FED starts printing money again and then you get a QE bow Market I've said this before and I'll say it again there's two types of bull markets in crypto there's quantitative tightening bull markets that occur during periods when the FED is lowering reducing the assets on their balance sheet that's what we got in 2019 and that's what we've got over here and during those periods during those periods eth Bitcoin goes down eth Bitcoin goes down during QT quantitative tightening bull markets how many people for the last couple of years have said that eth outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market that's not true not without any disclaimer because as you can see bitcoin's been going up since late November of 2022 and eth Bitcoin has been going down the entire time so that is why I still think there is some evidence to suggest the cycle may play out like it always does rather than a left translated top I'm not completely unsympathetic to the idea of a left translated Peak there's a lot of really smart people out there that frankly provide a compelling case for it and I could honestly provide a compelling case for it I just showed you guys some of the different charts but if Bitcoin does not run into the highest wristbands the 0. N to one wristband this summer and instead it just cools off like it did back over here after the having it might scare a lot of people off but perhaps it's just doing what it did last cycle and it the only reason that the top the local the midcycle top came later was because rate Cuts came later this cycle than they did last cycle so you have quantitative tightening bull markets where Bitcoin goes up as e Bitcoin bleeds all Bitcoin pairs bleed and then you have QE bull markets that go where Bitcoin goes up as eth Bitcoin goes up so eth outperforms Bitcoin in a QE Market but not a QT Market there's two different different types of bull markets so that is a very important distinction and I think we've only received more and more evidenced over the last year that Bitcoin really is dependent somewhat on monetary policy because last September when eth Bitcoin came back down to to this area right here there were there were a lot of people that thought that it had bottomed because that's when it had bottomed in the last cycle Q3 of the pre having year this development here which is what I said was likely going to happen this development of the the devaluation of eth against Bitcoin shows that the market is very much dependent on monetary policy whether we want to believe it or not so if that is the case right if that continues to be the case then you very well could see a a repeat of what happened over here sort of an intermediate Lull in the market followed by because of rate Cuts right that occur during rate Cuts followed by the last rate cut which leads to a QE bull market where you maybe top out when you normally do in the latter part of the post tapping year so two different theories if you're new here that's what is you know has really been discussed over the last uh year or so is this cycle different is it not I honestly think if you if you have a bias on it you're going to find the evidence that you're looking for um I I think we we'll know soon enough we we'll know soon enough if Bitcoin cools off into the summer which it very well could we we've seen gold breakout just like it did in mid 2019 we've seen eth Bitcoin break down just like it did in mid 20 M mid 2019 all Bitcoin pairs still haven't broken down yet but if it cools off into the summer then it just seems like it's the same thing as last cycle it's just that the the midcycle top was nine months later about about n nine months later if on the other hand after the having Bitcoin just accelerates to the upside once again then I will have to uh I will probably say that there's more Merit to the idea of of a left translated top but that's what I'm looking at right now and so to just revisit my prediction back in 2020 what would be the fair value of Bitcoin at the fourth having of 40 to 50k I find myself today seeing a $64,000 Bitcoin 4 days before the having and I I can't think I can't help but think to myself wow back then when I made that prediction I thought it was a lofty prediction that frankly was maybe not you know not that likely to come true because you know when Bitcoin is at 8K and and it really hadn't done anything for a couple of years I wasn't really that optimistic um of of you know exactly how accurate this prediction would be come to find out I was too conservative potentially right I was too conservative so it just goes to show how difficult these markets are to predict um four years ago price of Bitcoin was at 8K I said fourth having 40 to 50 instead we find ourselves at 64 and what's fascinating to me is that if we were at 40 to 50K I think it would you know a lot of people would think the the world's falling apart when in reality that would have been what the fair value sort of suggested it would be and that chart that chart that you see in that video is just this chart right here um these regression bands here so at the last taing we were at the fair value that's the other thing that why I said 40 to 50K back then because at every prior having Bitcoin was at the fair value so in no the fit to non-bubble data so in November 2012 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to non-bubble data in July of 2016 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to quote unquote non-bubble data in May of 2020 Bitcoin was at its fair value fit to again quote unquote non bubble data theoretically I should have updated this chart because it does I think need to get updated every cycle I haven't really done it yet if I did update it it would just shift it down very very slightly but right now according to this chart the fair value is around um 52k 52k but if you if you were to refit it based on this data over here it would actually probably put the fair value somewhere between 40 to 50K which is why I said back over here like we'll have to refit it um and and it'll be around 40 to 50K so we're above that level right now if on the other side of the having or something we see that level just know that that is is is what the um you know the regression band would have ultimately suggested for this part of the cycle so those are my thoughts going into the Bitcoin having we will see what happens uh as the having comes around it's only four days away and and we will do an update in maybe a month or so we'll see what happened you know after the having if we just contined to rally on into a left translated top or if it cools off like 2019 and and we just kind of come back down and and cool off until until the last rate cut arrives if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs

      "\n",
      "1. There are two main possibilities discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "a) Bitcoin could see a \"left-translated peak\" where the top occurs in 2024 rather than the typical Q4 of the post-halving year (2025). This would be an accelerated cycle compared to previous ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "b) Bitcoin could follow a more typical cycle pattern, where it cools off after the halving and then rallies into a top in late 2025, similar to previous cycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The key factors that will determine which path bitcoin takes are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If bitcoin accelerates higher after the halving and into the summer, that would support the left-translated peak idea.\n",
      "- If bitcoin cools off and consolidates for a few months after the halving, that would be more in line with a normal cycle playing out.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The video notes that bitcoin is currently ahead of the \"fair value\" projection made 4 years ago, which was $40-50k at this halving. The current $64k price is above that range.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Overall, the analyst sees two plausible scenarios - an accelerated left-translated cycle, or a more typical cycle playing out. The key will be how bitcoin behaves in the months after the halving.\n",

       "[Document(page_content='The video discusses a pattern that has emerged in the early phase of the Bitcoin halving year, where Bitcoin has historically dropped to its bull market support band in February. The speaker notes that this has occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and suggests that a similar drop of around 15% could happen again this year, potentially bringing Bitcoin to the 21-week or 20-week exponential moving average. The speaker acknowledges that the outcome may depend on the state of the economy, as in 2020 the support level did not hold due to the pandemic-induced recession. The overall sentiment is cautiously bearish, as the speaker highlights the potential for a significant short-term drop, while also acknowledging the possibility of a bounce-back scenario. The main message is that Bitcoin may experience a substantial dip in February, potentially reaching its bull market support band, which could serve as a buying opportunity or a concerning signal depending on the broader economic conditions.', metadata={'Author': 'Benjamin Cowen', 'Publish_Date': '2024-01-16 00:00:00', 'Type': 'Youtube video', 'title': 'Bitcoin: Early Halving Year Pattern', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7RECVl0k_U'}),\n",

The presenter suggests this pattern could repeat, potentially leading Bitcoin to test the bull market support band around $36K or the 100-week moving average around $29K. However, the presenter acknowledges this is not a guarantee and that Bitcoin could also avoid a significant dip.The video also discusses the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin often improves a few months after the Bitcoin having. The presenter believes that Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin will eventually break down, with this likely occurring sometime in the first half of the current having year.Overall, the sentiment is cautiously bullish, acknowledging potential downside risks in the near-term but maintaining a positive long-term outlook. The presenter suggests that a diversified, Bitcoin-heavy portfolio may be the best approach to navigate the potential volatility, rather than attempting to time the market perfectly. The presenter emphasizes the importance of having a clear investment strategy and sticking to it, rather than trying to predict the market's exact movements.\", metadata={'Author': 'Benjamin Cowen', 'Publish_Date': '2024-01-20 00:00:00', 'Type': 'Youtube video', 'title': 'Bitcoin: Halving Year Returns', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4vwS_U2OfM'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The video provides a detailed technical analysis of the Bitcoin market, focusing on the historical patterns observed during the early stages of the halving cycle. The speaker notes that Bitcoin typically experiences a 15-30% pullback in Q1 following the halving, and the current correction appears to be within this historical range. The video discusses potential support levels, including the 20-week EMA and the 100-week EMA, and suggests that the high 30k range could be a key level for the bulls to defend. The overall sentiment is cautiously bullish, with the speaker advising viewers to have a plan in place to navigate potential larger drops, while also noting that the market can surprise and that it's important to stick to a strategy based on risk levels rather than trying to time the market. The main message is that the current correction is within the expected range for the early halving year pattern, and that investors should have a plan in place to manage the potential risks and opportunities in the market.\", metadata={'Author': 'Benjamin Cowen', 'Publish_Date': '2024-01-24 00:00:00', 'Type': 'Youtube video', 'title': 'Bitcoin: Early Halving Year Pattern (Update)', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeLu4VoASCg'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The discussion covers several key topics related to the cryptocurrency market. The speaker expresses a bearish sentiment, noting that the altcoin market has struggled significantly against Bitcoin. They highlight the potential for Bitcoin dominance to continue increasing, potentially reaching 60% or higher, at the expense of altcoins.The speaker discusses the potential impact of rising interest rates and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy on the crypto market. They suggest that the narrative after the Bitcoin halving event may shift towards the market screaming at the Fed to give us rate cuts. The speaker believes that if the Fed maintains a higher-for-longer stance on interest rates, it could lead to a pricing back in of rate cuts, which could be a positive catalyst for the market.Regarding altcoins, the speaker cautions that the altcoin market is heavily reliant on Bitcoin's performance and that altcoin pairs often bottom before their USD pairs. They suggest that investors should be cautious about converting Bitcoin to altcoins, as the altcoin market may continue to bleed against Bitcoin during this phase of the cycle. The speaker provides historical examples, such as the performance of ADA/BTC and LINK/BTC, to illustrate the potential risks of holding altcoins during periods of Bitcoin dominance.The speaker also touches on the potential for a cooling-off period in the crypto market, similar to the previous cycle, and the importance of managing risk and preserving the Satoshi valuation of one's portfolio. They recommend a Bitcoin-heavy strategy with some cash and fixed-income exposure to navigate the current market conditions.Overall, the main message is that the crypto market may face challenges in the near future, with Bitcoin dominance likely to continue increasing at the expense of altcoins, and the potential for a more prolonged cooling-off period before the next altcoin season. The speaker emphasizes the importance of focusing on Satoshi valuation rather than USD valuation, as this can help investors better navigate the market dynamics.\", metadata={'Author': 'Benjamin Cowen', 'Publish_Date': '2024-04-18 00:00:00', 'Type': 'Youtube video', 'title': 'Bitcoin Halving Eve', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjHe5KLT1W8'})]"

       "[Document(page_content=\"The discussion covers several key topics related to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and the broader cryptocurrency market. The speakers provide technical analysis and share their views on the potential impact of the halving, as well as the influence of macroeconomic factors and the Federal Reserve's policies.The speakers acknowledge the historical pattern of Bitcoin price rallying in the year following a halving event, but also caution that the current market conditions and macroeconomic environment could introduce some uncertainty and volatility. They discuss the concept of sell in May and go away, analyzing past market cycles and the potential for a similar pattern this year, while also noting that the halving year may disrupt this traditional seasonal trend.The discussion also touches on the importance of Bitcoin dominance as a key indicator for the overall crypto market, with the speakers suggesting that Bitcoin dominance may peak before Bitcoin itself falls below its 20-week moving average. This leads to a broader conversation about the risks and opportunities in the altcoin and meme coin markets, with the speakers emphasizing the importance of having a diversified strategy and regularly converting gains back into Bitcoin as a more stable and long-term investment.Additionally, the speakers explore the recent strength in the gold market, discussing the potential reasons behind the rally and the relationship between gold, the US dollar, and Bitcoin. They note the similarities between gold and Bitcoin as stores of value and the potential for gold to continue its upward trend as the US dollar weakens.The speakers also provide insights on the importance of understanding basic technical analysis and on-chain indicators to help identify the right times to enter the market, emphasizing the need to focus on higher timeframes and avoid getting caught up in the volatility of the hourly charts. They highlight the value of educational resources, such as their own YouTube channels, in helping newcomers to the crypto space navigate the market and avoid common pitfalls like scams and mistakes in managing their funds.Finally, one of the speakers, Max, shares his motivation for starting a YouTube channel, highlighting the desire to contribute to the crypto community in a positive and educational way, drawing inspiration from the approach taken by the other speakers.Overall, the discussion provides a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the current state of the cryptocurrency market, the potential impact of the Bitcoin halving, and the broader macroeconomic factors that may influence the market's performance in the coming months.\", metadata={'Author': 'Benjamin Cowen', 'Type': 'Youtube video', 'day': 18.0, 'month': 'April', 'title': 'NFA Live!

       " Document(page_content=\"Bitcoin dominance has put in a new cycle high of 57%, contrary to expectations that it had already topped. The speaker argues this is due to the timing of the dominance top being more closely tied to monetary policy than the typical 4-year market cycle. As the Federal Reserve continues quantitative tightening and delays rate cuts, the speaker expects Bitcoin dominance to continue rising, potentially reaching 60%. The speaker acknowledges the process is not linear, with potential pullbacks, but believes the general resolution will be to the upside.The speaker analyzes Bitcoin dominance excluding stablecoins, noting a similar pattern of lower highs followed by a sweep of the previous high, just as occurred in the previous cycle. This suggests Bitcoin dominance could see one more pullback before resuming its ascent towards 60%. The speaker believes this is due to the close relationship between Bitcoin dominance and monetary policy, as opposed to the typical 4-year market cycle.Regarding Ethereum against Bitcoin, the speaker suggests it could bottom around June if there is no bounce, aligning with historical seasonal weakness for Ethereum in the summer months. However, the speaker cautions against relying too heavily on trend lines, as altcoins can sometimes break below them before finding a bottom. The speaker expects altcoin pairs against Bitcoin to continue bleeding, with the potential for a 42% drop to the range lows around 0.25 BTC, as they have historically oscillated between 0.25 and 1 BTC.The speaker further elaborates on the relationship between Bitcoin dominance and monetary policy, noting that Bitcoin dominance tends to rise even after assets like gold break out, as seen in the previous cycle. The speaker suggests Bitcoin dominance could top out in the summer months, as that is typically when retail investors are less active in the market, allowing altcoins to bleed back to Bitcoin.The speaker also discusses the potential for a scenario where altcoin pairs against Bitcoin and altcoin pairs against the US dollar could bottom at the same time, if a larger capitulation in the traditional markets leads to a significant Bitcoin drawdown. However, the speaker's base case remains that altcoin pairs against Bitcoin will bottom first, before altcoin pairs against the US dollar continue to bleed for a period.Overall, the sentiment remains bullish on Bitcoin dominance and bearish on altcoins, particularly Ethereum, based on the speaker's analysis of monetary policy and market cycles.\", metadata={'Author': 'Benjamin Cowen', 'Type': 'Youtube video', 'day': 21.0, 'month': 'April', 'title': 'Bitcoin Dominance', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrEdDZ94Od0', 'year': 2024.0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The video discusses the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which is expected to occur within the next few hours. The host acknowledges reaching a major milestone of 800,000 subscribers and expresses gratitude. Regarding the market outlook, the host presents two potential short-term scenarios - either Bitcoin goes straight to the 20-week simple moving average (SMA) following the halving, or it sees a bounce to the 8-week moving average before resolving to a lower low in May. The host notes that if the S&P 500 can reach its 20-week SMA, there is no reason why Bitcoin cannot do the same, as riskier assets like Ethereum and the total crypto market index have already been testing their bull market support bands. The host suggests that a period of Bitcoin consolidation and altcoin underperformance could lead to Bitcoin dominance reaching 60%. The host believes that regardless of the short-term outcome, Bitcoin is likely to test its 20-week SMA within the next 6 weeks, which could trigger a further altcoin sell-off, as alts may put in new lows even during the halving year. The overall sentiment is cautiously bearish, with the host anticipating a period of Bitcoin consolidation and altcoin underperformance in the coming months.Summary: The video presents a cautiously bearish outlook on the crypto market, with the host expecting Bitcoin to test its 20-week SMA in the next 6 weeks, potentially leading to further altcoin sell-off and Bitcoin dominance reaching 60%.', metadata={'Author': 'Benjamin Cowen', 'Type': 'Youtube video', 'day': 19.0, 'month': 'April', 'title': 'Bitcoin: The Halving Approaches', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhJFtaXaYxE', 'year': 2024.0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The discussion covers several key topics related to the cryptocurrency market. The speaker expresses a bearish sentiment, noting that the altcoin market has struggled significantly against Bitcoin. They highlight the potential for Bitcoin dominance to continue increasing, potentially reaching 60% or higher, at the expense of altcoins.The speaker discusses the potential impact of rising interest rates and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy on the crypto market. They suggest that the narrative after the Bitcoin halving event may shift towards the market screaming at the Fed to give us rate cuts. The speaker believes that if the Fed maintains a higher-for-longer stance on interest rates, it could lead to a pricing back in of rate cuts, which could be a positive catalyst for the market.Regarding altcoins, the speaker cautions that the altcoin market is heavily reliant on Bitcoin's performance and that altcoin pairs often bottom before their USD pairs. They suggest that investors should be cautious about converting Bitcoin to altcoins, as the altcoin market may continue to bleed against Bitcoin during this phase of the cycle. The speaker provides historical examples, such as the performance of ADA/BTC and LINK/BTC, to illustrate the potential risks of holding altcoins during periods of Bitcoin dominance.The speaker also touches on the potential for a cooling-off period in the crypto market, similar to the previous cycle, and the importance of managing risk and preserving the Satoshi valuation of one's portfolio. They recommend a Bitcoin-heavy strategy with some cash and fixed-income exposure to navigate the current market conditions.Overall, the main message is that the crypto market may face challenges in the near future, with Bitcoin dominance likely to continue increasing at the expense of altcoins, and the potential for a more prolonged cooling-off period before the next altcoin season. The speaker emphasizes the importance of focusing on Satoshi valuation rather than USD valuation, as this can help investors better navigate the market dynamics.\", metadata={'Author': 'Benjamin Cowen', 'Type': 'Youtube video', 'day': 18.0, 'month': 'April', 'title': 'Bitcoin Halving Eve', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjHe5KLT1W8', 'year': 2024.0})]"
