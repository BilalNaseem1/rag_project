Fallen!' by 'Benjamin Cowen' released on 2024-04-16 00:00:00\\nvideo url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLkNGuLT38E\\n\\nHi, the eth Bitcoin ratio has fallen if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom links in the description below we have a website with thousands of charts for hundreds of different cryptocurrencies so make sure you guys check that out again the sale will end at after the having let's go Ahad and jump in so the eth Bitcoin ratio is something that I have been tracking about as long as my channel has been around I find the eth Bitcoin ratio really useful in terms of navigating various phases of the market cycle if you have an edge on where you think think e Bitcoin on where e Bitcoin is going to go then theoretically you have an edge on where then Bitcoin dominance is going to go and how to adjust your portfolio to maximize your risk adjusted returns we have just had a major event happen in the cryptoverse but I think it is largely gone unnoticed so far but I do think it will become more evident in the coming weeks so this video is going to first go through the eth Bitcoin ratio and my prior views on it we will then talk about the implications on you know the USD valuation of eth and then finally I will talk a little bit about a potential path for eth Bitcoin to finally bottom out so before we get too far into this you know one of the things that inevitably happens when I post these videos is you know the the Bitcoin Maxi talk comes out they just say oh he's just a Bitcoin Maxi but let me just go through you know a few of my prior thoughts in the video are on on on eth bitcoin so I actually the the first video you will find on my channel the first two in fact are primarily on the eth Bitcoin valuation here's one here's the first one this is the oldest video on my channel e ethereum timing the longterm momentum shifts we are in a very strong by region so so in the video I talk about how eth Bitcoin was significantly undervalued at 02 and that it was a strong by region and that we were likely going to spend the next sever several years seeing the eth Bitcoin valuation go up I Then followed it up in my next video where I said it I just made the title eth Bitcoin is severely undervalued you can see that right before ethereum takes off you know at least in the last cycle it likes to hug this 20we moving average for a bit and that's what we're so we were making all the same comparisons for the prior cycle and talking about how it was likely going to enter into a major uptrend so it's important for me to say this because inevitably whenever I post a video on the eth Bitcoin valuation what people will say is that zoom out you know and and look at the chart and and they sort of point out these higher lows and my only point you know is that it's a market right and yes I was I was bullish on it over here but just like anything in the market nothing ever goes straight up straight up nothing goes straight down it's okay to Pivot your view if the market changes and so then I pivoted my view when we started to notice that ethereum's Bitcoin valuation was looking awfully similar similar to the Bitcoin USD woff distribution so why are we talking about this well the problem is that you could argue the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is so is showing some similarities right these so we talk about how the eth Bitcoin valuation was showing similarities to the Bitcoin USD wof distribution woff distribution and this was when it was at 073 now after that we saw it collapse all the way down 2.05 this collapse is actually a very common collapse that happens between two major Peaks so if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about look at the eth Bitcoin valuations weekly candles and you will see a very familiar pattern that has happened now a third time and is in the process of of still happening and that pattern namely is that you get a Peak you then set a low you then get a slightly lower high you then come back down to the low spend some months trying to hold it as support but ultimately you fail and then we go into final capitulation that lasts for two or three months you will see the same thing happened over here you set a peak you set a low then you set a secondary Peak where it is a lower high you come back down to the low you try to hold it for a few months but you fail to and then you capitulate for two to three months before setting the bottom the same thing has happened once again where you have a peak you set a low you then set a secondary Peak that's a lower high you then bleed back down to the low and you try to hold it for a few months but you fail and then you bleed below that that low and then you capitulate for a few months this is the general Trend the general path that the eth Bitcoin valuation takes and so in this video when we talked about this this distribution phase what ended up happening is we did go back down we went down we set a low then we went right back up to set a secondary distribution phase we can see similarities in these two charts for instance you not only do you have the wof distribution phase but you also have this this potential double top that's occurr so we talked about how the E Bitcoin valuation back then was essentially mimicking the Bitcoin USD secondary distribution phase where it had a double top in late 2021 right so you can see that it had these four tops and then a double top over here sort of your one two p and then it bled back down to the range lows tried to hold it and then once it failed to hold it it capitulated and we said back then that it looks like the same thing is happening where eth Bitcoin had a secondary distribution phase right you had your first distribution phase here and then a secondary distribution phase up here where you have your little one2 top bleed back down to the range lows and then finally capitulate just like Bitcoin USD capitulated here in June of 2022 so this whole process that we've been talking about has been playing out but it's been playing out over a very long period of time so we started off with saying timing this long-term momentum shift at at at 0.02 saying it's severely undervalued at 0.0019 or whatever it was at here then acknowledging look it looks like a distribution phase up at Point 73 and then at the merge when it was at 0083 saying look this looks to be like a secondary distribution phase do you guys remember what it was like at the merge all the eth Maxis were calling for the flipping some of them were calling for it to double up bitcoin's market cap it was absolutely delusional right and every step of the way I mean every throughout this entire process we've seen nothing but lower high after lower high and every time that it happens it draws more people back in it leads to a lot of like taunting and mocking but they've all just been lower highs right they've all just been lower highs and now after watching eth Bitcoin bleed for two and a half years from this high it has finally broken support this is a major milestone in the crypto verse for those who care to pay attention to it I wish I had paid closer attention to it in Prior Cycles now there's something we have to talk about here okay and that is what are the implications of it going forward and what are the implications of it on its USD valuation because while I have tried to spend hours and hours and hours convincing people that the Bitcoin valuation of these cryptocurrencies is the only thing that matters I've failed at convincing everyone and so a lot of people still do care about its USD evaluation and I'm not going to necessarily I mean I will provide my opinion but I'm just going to show you what happened the last two times that e Bitcoin closed below this major support level it's happened twice before okay it happened here in November of October of 2016 October November of 2016 and then it happened over here in June July of 2019 so it's happened two times before what did ethusd do during that time so if you were to Overlay ethusd onto this chart what we're going to do is just say what did it do after the breakdown occurred okay So Below when it when it went first below the range low from this Wick right here so you can see that it went below the range low in October of 2016 if we zoom in we can maybe see it a little bit closer so you can see it right right here it went below the range low in October of 2016 when it went below the range low in October of 2016 you can see that October was down 18% November it was down 21.5% and then December it went down 5. 6% by the week by the monthly close however the whole move here from October through December Sal ethusd dropped 54% 54% all right that's one example now following that drop we know what happened next right this is one example by the way in this example when ethusd dropped Bitcoin actually went up if you were to Overlay Bitcoin USD onto this chart you'll see that Bitcoin didn't really care about what eth was doing during that time it just went up okay now look at the second time this happened where eth Bitcoin fell below support it happened in July of 2019 now what happened to ethusd starting then well you can see that on this USD pair at dropped out 1 month before and then it bled down 75% now I know what you're thinking that was a pandemic drop that caused it to drop 75% I would say it gives you insight into what could happen if a recession occurs right regardless of what triggers it whether it's a Black Swan or whether it's just a slow long progression of the yield curve and all that stuff if we ignore that let's just suppose we get a landing and there's no recession right which is a big assumption but let's just for a minute suppose that that's true even in that case even before the pandemic was a thing eth still dropped 68% from the highs when eth Bitcoin broke down so you have two examples of eth breaking down and really measured from this top here in September it actually dropped around 60% so you have two examples where when eth Bitcoin broke down as measured from the previous local top on ethusd eth dropped 60% if you actually take it from this top over here you can see it was closer to a 72% drop and this one remember was about a 75% drop so what do you notice when eth Bitcoin breaks down it has never been good for ethusd even when Bitcoin went up now in the second case over here Bitcoin actually went down right so so in this case Bitcoin went down in 2019 in 2016 Bitcoin went up so what does that show you it shows you that no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD Bitcoin dominance went up during those times and eth Bitcoin went down e Bitcoin went down and so the question is is what does that mean this time because so many people out there right and I I it's almost scary how how how many people are saying it right so many people out there are Shilling memes and and outright scams and they're being paid to do it and they do it over and over and over again and their followers follow them and they get wrecked and then they just keep on doing it because there's always some other 100x gem that they're going to recommend that they were paid to recommend okay now for a while people just assume it's okay and that nothing is nothing bad is happening but this is a major event that eth Bitcoin has fallen it's a major event and I think not enough people are are paying attention to it they're focused on other things they're focused on the the latest meme coin craze they're rationalizing why their altcoins are down 30 to 40% over the last couple of weeks this is a major event I know it's a meme guy I me get it I get it but if you look at the logarithmic regression trend line for eth fit to to non-bubble data you will see that after eth Bitcoin broke down here and here eusd went to the lower logarithmic regression trend line or home if you will that's what happened and I can't help but wonder why should this time be any different because as we saw over here eth USD dropped from the local high 72% over here even if you don't worry about the pandemic it still dropped about 66 67% if you include the recession 73 or 72% or so if you take this from here from 4K a 70% drop puts you exactly at the fair value logarithmic aggression trend line that's where it would put ethereum and I don't know why we should assume this time is any different one thing to consider is that you know I know a lot of people are talking about a left translated cycle and so as I've said before I'm not completely unsympathetic to that view I'm not but I don't for for me I still think if you want exposure to crypto I I think Bitcoin makes more sense than ethereum right now now that doesn't mean that Bitcoin can't collapse I think it probably will get a pretty big drop um at at some point especially as as the yield curve un inverts but I don't know exactly when that's going to be um we do know that last cycle Bitcoin topped out about a month before the First Rate cut I know the First Rate cut is getting priced further and further out but I think that the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in I've explained what I mean by that before I really want to spend a ton of time explaining that again so ethusd potentially is starting to turn the corner here and what's actually fascinating about ethusd when you look at it on its USD pair when it broke down against Bitcoin last time the pattern is almost identical we have this wedge that ethusd broke out of right we have this wedge ethusd broke out of it topped eth Bitcoin broke down right there eth USD then fell back through the wedge right it fell back through the wedge now look at it over here it's the same thing you have a wedge that ethusd was in for a long time and now eth Bitcoin has broken down ethusd is starting to correct and it looks like it's potentially going to correct right through the wedge just like it did over here which by the way occurred as those rate Cuts finally arrived so I don't really care what the CME Market tool thing is is showing for when rate cuts are going to occur I look at this and say if this keeps on dropping like this it represents a consumer that is starting to falter and therefore it will likely not take until November or September for a rate cut I could see a rate cut coming this Summer Okay so this pattern to me looks like it's playing out once again I have said forever that after eth Bitcoin breaks down we will likely see ethusd fall back through this wedge to me it looks like it is finally happening so I think that it makes a lot of sense to view the market view ethusd through the lens of eth Bitcoin and the reason for that is over the last two and a half years if you wanted exposure to crypto then you have to figure out what you're going to buy and of course if you're if you're a full Deen and you're you're buying micro cap stuff you're probably not really interested in what I have to say anyways but if you're not as risky if you don't want to take on as much risk um if you're dealing with say a significant amount of money um a large percentage of your of your funds are going into high you know some of these risky assets and you don't want to speculate too much out of the top you know top cup two or three maybe the top 10 then understanding these patterns are I think very important to navigate the cryptoverse in a successful way and so over the last two and a half years if you wanted exposure to crypto and you decided what do you want to buy do you want to buy Bitcoin or eth my view for the last two and a half years is that Bitcoin is the better play because it will likely hit new all-time highs first which it did it will likely not be subject to as much regulation risk as ethereum and also guess what during quantitative tightening e Bitcoin bleeds and it's as simple as that and you know I've seen all sorts of narratives out there that are saying that well proof of stake has failed or that you know there's all these other things there's no evidence of that yet actually there really isn't this is all just monetary policy stuff there's no evidence of any of that yet I think Bitcoin has stood the test of time well and I hope that ethereum does but everything that you've seen happen since November 202 1 is an artifact of monetary policy nothing more so it might lead people to believe that proof of stake is failing when in reality it's just an artifact of tighter monetary policy which is exactly what we saw last cycle in fact during quantitative tightening last cycle we saw the eth Bitcoin valuation bleed in fact if you were to Overlay Bitcoin USD onto this chart you will find that we had a bull market in 2019 and during that bull market Bitcoin did not put in a new high but eth Bitcoin went down because the Fed was still doing quantitative tightening what marked the bottom for eth Bitcoin what marked the bottom it was precisely when the fed pivoted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing that was the bottom it wasn't any more complicated than that it wasn't the narratives that you could have come up with back then it had nothing to do with what some YouTuber was saying about whether it was going to just go to zero or something all it had to do was was was the FED printing money or not was the FED reducing the size of the balance sheet or were they increasing the size of the balance sheet that's what it came down to and once again everyone's trying to over complicate it and come up with a thous different narratives for why it's happening and I said a long time ago that this was what's going to happen when it breaks down people will find a reason and of course the reason that people are looking at is regulation risk which is what we said a long time ago some of the reg regulation news that we've seen recently and also the potential rejection of the spot ETF for ethereum none of that stuff matters none of it matters ethereum has been fine without a spot ETF forever it's not going to die if it if it's rejected I think ethereum's valuation against the US dollar is going down but not because of the spot ETF eth went to $4,800 without a spot ETF I think eth USD is going to go down because eth Bitcoin has broken support it is broken below the June 2022 low and that is the important thing to consider you know if you if you don't follow it too closely we can look very closely at it here the low in June of 2022 for eth Bitcoin was 0.409 so if you draw a line across the page at 0409 so we're going to get a line here 040 well let me get it exact right here there you have it 0049 that was the low and what I said was that we will get a weekly close below the range low and when we do that is when ethereum finally starts to go down on its USD valuation and you can see eth Bitcoin is capitulating below the range low ethusd is starting to capitulate as well last cycle the first month that ethusd fell after e Bitcoin topped a 25% drop by the monthly close a 25% drop by the monthly close for eth this time would put it at around 2700 give or take a 100 or so you know because I didn't really get that accurate there about 27 let's just say 27 2800 something like that 26 2800 because it's not going to be exact anyways just because it was 25 here doesn't mean it has to be 25 here but then where it became brutal was while a lot of people assumed that it would be a buy the dip opportunity the following month after eth Bitcoin broke down it dropped another 21% right so imagine if ethusd first drops that 25% to get it down to 2700 and then drops another 21% from there where does that put e coincidentally it puts it at $2,000 right at 2K and what you'll notice is after it had this drop it then tried to hold that as support for a little while right and that support level that it tried to hold was also the the resistance level back over here it was the resistance level this resistance level was 2K right so my guess is that this summer and probably as maybe even as soon as May in fact May or June I think we will see there's a there's a high likelihood we will see eth at 2K if I'm wrong it's because Bitcoin is getting some type of left translated cycle and it's just dragging eth up with it right and in that case case while technically I would be wrong about about ethusd you would still be better off with Bitcoin than ethereum okay I wish I had known this stuff in Prior Cycles it's not like anyone told me I learned the hard way and I was hoping to help other people not go through that and that's why I've been talking about the Bitcoin dominance forever and all Bitcoin pairs forever so 2K is the level that I think eth is going to correct down to after the Bitcoin having from there it will probably try to hold it as support is my guess but I also think that it will fail to hold it as support and I do think it will eventually go to the lower logarithmic regression trend line if you look at a lot of these bottoming processes for ethereum what you'll notice notice is that it doesn't just tend to put in one low and then never revisit it right you can see over here it put in a low and then it got pretty close to testing it a while later if you just look at monthly closes you can see that these monthly closes we eventually Wicked below the monthly closes you can see over here these monthly closes we eventually went below them right so once again I think eth will eventually go back below these levels and and go back to the lower logarithmic regression trend line especially now that eth Bitcoin has fallen so just as everyone is getting hyped up for the Bitcoin having and and all the things that come with it what happens if this plays out and instead of getting a left translated Peak like everyone's talking about what happens if we just bleed after it for 6 months and we just see ethusd go back to the lower logarithmic aggression trend line we had a we had a 9month bare Market over here after eth Bitcoin broke down if you ignore the pandemic we had a six-month bare market after eth Bitcoin broke down why can't that happen again Bitcoin when Bitcoin sneezes the rest of the market gets extremely sick take a look at where Bitcoin is this cycle okay as measured Peak to Peak as measured Peak to Peak you can see how far ahead of schedule we are I mean we are so far ahead of schedule right now Bitcoin has never been this heat of going into the having it's always been the last two cycles Bitcoin was 60% below its high when we went into the having if Bitcoin falls back into line with the last couple of Cycles what happens to eth you know I mean you can see that eth Bitcoin is going down right so if Bitcoin USD goes back to where it was previously let's say Bitcoin goes back to where it was just say like I don't know half a year ago but instead of eth Bitcoin being up here it's all the way down here then ethusd gets hit a lot harder right that's the reason why the Bitcoin valuations are important if you take the inverse of one over if you take the inverse of e Bitcoin so you're looking at the Bitcoin eth valuation what do you notice over here one Bitcoin would have gotten you about 11 to 12 eth now it gets you 20 eth I think it's going to go out pretty high here and potentially get you know 32 E when it's all said and done now when you look at eth Bitcoin there's a case to be made that it's either on a logarithmic regression path or it's an oscillator okay so the logarithmic regression path would be viewed like this something like that meaning even if you're a long-term Bull on the eth Bitcoin valuation which I've said many many times like I can understand why you might be I mean these are technically higher lows but even if you are it's still likely is going to go down to the 03 to 04 range before you figure out if the higher lows are important or if the lower Highs are more important because everyone on X whenever I post anything about the eth Bitcoin valuation they will tell me well you're ignoring the higher low I'm not ignoring anything you know I've pointed them out a million times but the reality is that you have higher lows here but eth Bitcoin has also not seen a new high since 2017 that's a long time you know imagine if like Bitcoin hadn't seen a new all-time high since 2017 you know how people give uh the gold bugs a hard time because gold took like 10 years to put on a new all-time high I mean who are you talking to if you're an eth maxi you have no room to stand really here because it's been bleeding against Bitcoin since 2017 yes eusd has gone to new Highs but so what you still you know it still was lower highs against Bitcoin sure as measured from the bottom e outperforms Bitcoin in a QE bull market how many people have said over the last two and a half years that you know just you wait e outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market it outperforms Bitcoin in a QE bull market but in a qt bull market e Bitcoin gets annihilated in fact if you look at quarterly returns for eth Bitcoin the last if you include this quarter which is just started the last six quarters have been red you know that's not the definition of holding up well that's the definition of a slow and painful bleed where retail investors keep capitulating because they they're changing their mind about it and I think that eth Bitcoin has entered into the final capitulation phase so I don't know exactly how long it's going to take to find a bottom I can tell you that the last couple of times it took about two to three months okay so here you can see we broke down in like October it bottomed out about two months later here it broke down in Ju July it bottomed out about 2 months later about 8 weeks in fact so there is a case to be made that it could bottom in June right there's a case to be made that it could um again it's probably going to be dependent on when the FED pivots If the Fed doesn't pivot until later then it could take longer for it to bottom in fact while it did bottom in June it still or sorry over here while it bottomed in August and then basically put in a double bottom in December now a lot of people will say that I've seen on on X when I post about this they'll say oh so you're just telling me in two more months eth is you know they'll say that they'll their interpretation of me saying that eth Bitcoin might find a bottom this summer their interpretation of that is to then immediately assume that that means eth is going to Skyrocket following that the reality is that even after eth Bitcoin bottomed in August of 2019 eth us D even after eth Bitcoin bottomed ethusd still dropped 47% after that and if you ignore the pandemic it dropped about 30% okay that is going to be the next phase of the market cycle which I think is going to be a difficult phase because do you know how over the last two and a half years I've said that that eth Bitcoin will go down no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD the next phase of the cycle as we get into rate cuts is especially when the FED pivots from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing and E Bitcoin finally finds a bottom probably between 03 to 04 the next phase is me saying that eth Bitcoin goes up no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD the reason why that's going to be challenging is because a lot of people are going to assume that if eth Bitcoin is going up they're going to assume that ethusd is going up but in reality that's not what happened last cycle eth Bitcoin started to go up and put in higher lows and I mean this was a higher low here but ethusd was still going down that's why the last year has been frustrating because Bitcoin dominance has gone up and I said many times that e Bitcoin will bleed no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD and it has but ethusd has gone up so people feel like they missed out my only point was if you want crypto bitcoin's better play than eth so yes maybe you feel like you missed out on eth you still just would have been better off with Bitcoin so you didn't really miss out on anything in fact if you were to go look at a DCA strategy if you had bought Bitcoin $100 of it even since the beginning of 2022 through today you're currently up about 125% had you done the same thing for ethereum you're only up 68% right and if you actually take it from say November of 2022 right if we actually take it from the the the capitulation region or whatever you can see that with eth you'd be up about 69% but with Bitcoin you'd be up 120% so this is why I mean I've learned my lesson you know I've tried really hard to sort of preach the the the talk about Bitcoin dominance and all Bitcoin Pairs and and thinking that I could get to through to some people and I think I have reached some people but I can assure you the next cycle this will not be my goal okay it will not be my goal anymore because I've learned the hard way that people do not care about Bitcoin valuations for the most part they mostly focus on USD valuations and they don't see that eth Bitcoin has dropped 40% from the highs all they care about or 45% from the highs all they care about is the fact that it's gone up recently but I think people are about to find out why the Bitcoin valuation matters it's been fun in games up until this point but eth Bitcoin had not broken support it has broken support now the last two times this happened ethusd had a considerable drop and it lasted for at least a few months over here and then the last cycle it lasted for about half a year so please understand that this is not you know do you think I I mean look guys I really enjoyed talking about e Bitcoin back over here when I was bullish on it in 2019 I really enjoyed it and and everyone liked you know everyone liked me and then I became the bad guy in you know in in 2022 when I pointed out the fact that eth Bitcoin was in a distribution phase and it was very hard for me mentally because I had a lot of friends back then in the ethereum community that essentially turned their back on me and and started you know they they were once people that I communicated with in a good way and in a positive way and because I Chang my view they you know essentially completely changed their opinion about me and it's been very hard dealing with that um and and you know even this video over here I talked about the coming collapse you know talking about it coming back down here and and and continuing to to sort of break down um you know looking at at these various Trends and I you know Market the market is a difficult thing you know because if you're bullish on something and I mean this is maybe some advice for for any of you guys that search your own YouTube channel um it's hard because I I I feel like as as and this is maybe just some Reflections but think as a as a influencer for back lack of better word in the crypto space naturally you're going to be if you're making videos about something you're going to be bullish on it more for for a lot of people right if you're going to start a YouTube channel on an asset class it's not like you're going to start it just to say you know say bad things about it right when you start it you're naturally bullish on it right I started mine in mid 2019 I was bullish on eth bitcoin I saw the opportunity there but as an influencer you either stop making videos as the hero or you do it long enough to become the villain and it's not a fun place to be um it's really not and I I'm I'm happy that this process is is likely almost over but I still think it needs at least a couple more months okay June at the earliest is my guess that eth Bitcoin bottoms out June at the earliest about mid June could be when it finally bottoms out which would be interesting because that's when it bottomed out in 2022 in fact so if you look at it from that perspective what if it just bottoms eight weeks after breaking support just like it did here and just like it did here and if it bottoms eight weeks later after breaking support that puts the bottom in mid June basically maybe early June early let me get this exact because I don't I don't want to tell you guys something this wrong um from the low so we broke it last week so eight weeks later would be the week of June 3 right so I mean if it if it happened by the end of the week right it would be you know June 10th right June 9th June 10th so I could see a compelling case for it essentially bottoming out as early as June but it's also going to be dependent on monetary policy right if we get to June and the FED is still not cutting rates and and they're still not going from quantitative easing to quantitative or quantitative tightening to quantitative easing then it might go on longer and you know it's very possible we just go into a recession um but I I do think my base case at this point in time is that eth Bitcoin bottoms this summer ethusd bleeds a little bit longer and then at some point later this year or early next year the FED will will turn the money printer back on and then you will see a bull you know a a bull phase for the E Bitcoin valuation but I don't think we're there yet I don't and you know this is a long process you can't really rush it we can come up you know everyone's had a thousand different narratives for the last two and a half years as to why I was wrong on the eth Bitcoin valuation the deflationary aspect of it the tokenomics right all the merge proof of stake all these things they said I'm not considering the spot ETF right even after the spot ETF for Bitcoin was launched what happened eth Bitcoin got a pretty big pump and do you guys realize how many people dunked on me then where are they now right because it just keeps on bleeding and now I'm seeing the same thing now people are saying well after the having you know e Bitcoin will will show you what's up but I I don't think so I think it's going to keep on bleeding for the next couple of months maybe bottoming out by mid June at the earliest maybe early to mid June um potentially later depending on on what the FED does those are my views it's been hard expressing them for a while but to be completely honest I I don't apologize for them um this is the entire reason I I mean I I just wanted to help right I just wanted to help the Bitcoin dominant stuff I know it's made me a ton of enemies but I I was just trying to help and and now it's you know it's a it's it's broken out right it really has broken out and I think it's about to go to 60% that's where I think it's going 60% so it can't get to 60% easily if eth Bitcoin doesn't drop and I I do think that eth Bitcoin is going to drop to the 03 to 0.04 range and the reason why you should heed this warning if you don't hold ethereum is because the altcoin market gets wrecked even worse okay so if you look at altcoins from last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down the altcoin market got destroyed frankly um you know if you were to look at at total three and I know everyone's just saying this is a is a dip buying opportunity but I'm I'm over here thinking that this is this right this is when you know this was just before the FED pivoted what if this is the same thing and everyone's just buying the dip on alt as they just slowly bleed back down for the next several months so when eth Bitcoin collapsed last cycle all USD valuations fell 72% so I guess it was actually about the same um as as as eth us so about 72% so 72% drop would actually put alt at a new low can that happen maybe I often come back to this idea that everyone you know that no one's going to like but if their Bitcoin valuation can put in new lows right like if A's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if Dot's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if litecoin's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if maddox's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if all of these different altcoins can put in new lows on their Bitcoin valuations then they can put new lows on their USD valuations too I didn't want to believe it last cycle I really didn't and and that's what happened they put in new lows a lot of them put in new lows so I think that is is is something that is worthwhile to think about you know and I I know I I know these I I hate putting these videos out frankly because then I'm just inundated with with um you know with with people who who troll me back but I don't want to I don't want to say things that don't believe and I learned the lesson the hard way the last cycle and the reality of the situation right the reality the altcoin Reckoning was was always based on their Bitcoin valuations I said that in basically every altcoin Reckoning video the altcoin Reckoning re refers to the devaluation of alt Bitcoin pairs alt Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows what does that mean it means the altcoin Reckoning never ended that's what it means that's my interpretation of it so those are my thoughts about ethereum I've tried to you know to be diplomatic about the US Dev evaluation um in terms of hey it's going to go up if Bitcoin goes up but with eth Bitcoin breaking down I I do feel some very strong conviction that it is is time it is time for ethereum to make the Journey Back to the lower regression band admittedly it has taken a lot longer than I thought I'm not going to pretend like I predicted this perfectly because I haven't and I've been wrong about many many things but the last two cycles that e Bitcoin broke down that is when eth went to the lower logarithmic progression trend line and I just I don't think this time is going to be any different if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe crypt.of this either way um but as we you know as we do get further into the cycle um you know I know a lot of you guys are are wanting me to talk a lot more about altcoins especially as they bought them out against Bitcoin but frankly I don't know I mean I I do want to talk about at least the larger you know the the Bitcoin and ethereum I will talk about those but there's so much there's just so much garbage being shilled everywhere right now that that that people are being paid to do it and it's just it's such a you know such such a disheartening thing honestly like I will get people asking me to uh shill a a micro cap you know a meme coin and they'll offer you know money to do so and I will say no and I will ignore them and I I honestly just typically block them because I I don't really want to talk to those people and then a few days later I will see people on on X Shilling that coin and and I know and they pretend like they just think it's a good coin when in reality I know that they're being paid to do it and they're not disclosing it and then their followers are following them and then they're selling those those they they they were given these allocations in these projects and they're selling those coins to their followers as they promote them and those people get all the accolades because that's what people want they want the 100x gems they want to gamble right but that usually doesn't work right get rich quick schemes really don't work and um you really have to be careful and you know the issue that I found is that so many people in crypto they just they they they forget about it right they'll they'll fall for the scams and then and then they'll get mad at those people that Shield them and then six months later they'll forget about it and fall for the same thing over again so I I really do hope that people stop doing it I hope that people stop following the people that do it because it it makes a joke of the entire industry and I I think that if we're ever going to grow as an industry we really have to get past all the meme coin stuff I'm not saying that you can't have some form of of the Mee coin there's always going to be something there but guys I mean there's like thousands of them right now and and that's why you're seeing Bitcoin dominance go up everyone who was bullish on altcoins this year for the most part told me that Bitcoin dominance had topped so yes some of the altcoins went up on their USD valuations but not because the reasons they thought right Bitcoin went up more um and now if Bitcoin does cool off after the having then then they find out why their altcoins went up and it wasn't because there was anything fundamentally great about it it was just because Bitcoin went up and people were chasing the next great thing but just be careful uh be careful with all those accounts that are are shilling that garbage um out there I want to be clear I don't think ethereum Falls in that category I think ethereum is a legitimate project and my views on its Bitcoin valuation are not a reflection on my fundamental views of ethereum they're just a reflection on monetary policy and that's what makes it so difficult is because you know being bearish on eth bitcoin makes a lot of people assume I'm antie when in reality the very first videos on my channel were bullish on the eth Bitcoin valuation so I've learned a lot I mean as you know just as as a person making content in the crypto space um over the last couple years I'm not really sure if I want to go through that process again next cycle but um that's where we stand we'll see if this if it plays out kind of like it did the last couple of Cycles if I'm wrong which there's a chance I've been wrong about plenty of things I do think that if I am wrong about eusd going back down there it must be because we're getting some type of left translated cycle that's not my base case I my base case is not for a translated cycle it's not um I just think that if we do go uh if it doesn't follow this path then I I think it must be because of a left translated cycle any we'll go and wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in Please Subscribe if you're not subscribe give a video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on IND the cryptoverse premium and inth crypto.com and I'll see

Page Views' by 'Benjamin Cowen' released on 2024-02-05 00:00:00\\nvideo url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2m8ou_0oB0\\n\\nHi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing Wikipedia page views if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse docomo that will hopefully help you navigate the crypto verse just a bit better one interesting thing is that we can track social interest I mean we we've done videos on the social risk before but we can track social interest quite easily by looking at you know views to to to YouTube channels and and new followers on Twitter to people that talk about cryptocurrency this is just simply looking at new Wikipedia page views to the to the Bitcoin page and what what's fascinating is that you can see that during the 2017 Peak it spiked quite high and in fact it went a lot higher in 2017 than it did over here in 2021 now there is an explanation for that I think and that is that as crypto has grown as an asset class there's obviously a lot of other cryptocurrencies as well and so while we did not get a spike on the search term or the Wikipedia page for Bitcoin in 2021 if you were to go look at cryptocurrency you can see that there was a very similar spike in 2021 around that first Peak just like there was in 2017 and in fact if you look even recently we've seen it slowly trending back up it looks like it found um at least for the the search the page of cryptocurrency you can see that it found some these lows back in April and it has been trending higher although at least in recent days it's starting to go back down now that the spot ETF stuff is behind us of course with the with the having around the corner we could still see that interest come right back but it might be interesting to Overlay all of them right so now what we're looking at is the sum of you know these pages that look at not only Bitcoin page and the cryptocurrency page but also ethereum as well as many others and when you do that you get a chart that looks like this which is interesting from the perspective of major Peak here on Wikipedia page views in 2017 very similar thing in 2021 but there hasn't really been a whole lot of interest for a while right I mean now price has gone up the price of Bitcoin has gone up but there's not a lot of people searching for cryptocurrency right now so the social interest Still Remains relatively relatively low it's like when we talk about the social risk and you know what is it going to take to get people interested right what is it going to take retail participants interested in crypto again that are not already here you might say well hey I'm interested but there's a difference between say someone that stuck around for all of 2022 and all of 2023 and they're just still here right there's a difference between that type of person and the person that only joined in the first peak of 2021 lost all their money in the summer crash and then just left right and you can see I mean it's it's pretty clear that those people have not returned right you can see that they have not in terms of in terms of search interest and of course this is also seen in in YouTube views and and and throughout various metrics but I think it's an interesting way to look at the cryptoverse to just get an idea of of of where we are in terms of the social sentiment in the space and you know is it trending up is it trending down or is it relatively sideways I think you could argue that uh it was trending down in 2022 or late 2021 trending down throughout most of 2022 but it seems like it's it's been relatively flat um you know for about a year now I mean it it did get some spikes over here going into the spot ETF stuff but it is still it has still been relatively flat a couple of things to note is that this Spike over over here in 2021 of course occurred after the having and it it occurred during loose monetary policy same thing over here this Spike occurred in 2017 it occurred after the having and it occurred during loose monetary policy so perhaps one of the reasons we haven't seen a you know a a similar type of spike is because we are before the having and we have also not seen the shift to looser monetary policy so perhaps those are the two ingredients that you need and it could be sort of representative of the idea that price is not the only thing that brings brings people back I mean Bitcoin has gone up what 3x from the from the from the 2022 lows and and still the search interest for all these cryptocurrencies Still Remains relatively flat so to me it implies that there's something more to it and and that you need you know you need looser monetary policy which conveniently also often corresponds to the having which Maybe by chance maybe by maybe not also happens to be an election year right we talk about like that cyclical behavior of of crypto and and you can kind of see it pretty clearly on this chart that you you get that interest at least in terms of Wikipedia page views to these assets after the having but it also tends to correspond to lose to monetary policy and even in 2019 you can see there was all sorts of positive price action where Bitcoin actually went up more in 2019 than it has throughout this entire rally over here because back over here it went up more than 3x from the lows and you can see that interest still didn't really come back until the very end of the having year right in the early part of the post having year and even over here you can see that while Bitcoin was going up for a while even in the having year it didn't really start to go up until halfway through the post having year so just interesting you know some interesting ways to look at the market hopefully this has been you know insightful uh to you guys to be the market like this again if you

of...' by 'Benjamin Cowen' released on 2024-01-26 00:00:00\\nvideo url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUWpziOMk-4\\n\\nHi, today we're going to talk about market cap hypotheticals for various cryptocurrencies if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse tocom I do mention into the cryptoverse decom into the cryptoverse premium quite a bit uh but I do want you to be aware that there is a free tier in fact and on that free tier is the DCA simulation tool um and we've also recently added this tool so if you like what you see in the video and you would like to explore what I'm doing but for say um an asset that you hold then you can do that okay you can do that and it and it doesn't cost anything you can just go to the website and sign up I think having some tools available for free uh is is great because it can help people better understand market dynamics it can better understand help people understand you know various strategies that they should they should focus on now this is bit a bit more of of of a fun video someone someone suggested yesterday that I should make some more fun videos occasionally um and I I understand that my my content can get pretty repetitive I know the Bitcoin dominance views are repetitive like you know Bitcoin will basically chop up chop up the altcoin market until the dominance is is much higher and unfortunately I can't speed things along right like those are my views and I don't think those views are going to change until we're on the other side of of rate cuts which probably are going to come within the next few months so at least we have that to look forward to which is nice but in the meantime I I wanted to at least show this chart basically what it is is it's just saying if this cryptocurrency had the market cap of another cryptocurrency what would the price be right what would the price be I think a lot of people have thought about that before you know like if if altcoin a had the market cap of altcoin B then where would the price be and so what this video allows you to do or sorry not what the chart allows you to do is it allows you to select an asset right and going through the first several hundred right maybe a couple hundred almost couple hundred cryptocurrencies now I don't know 99.9 I mean I don't I probably don't even know what like 95% of those cryptocurrencies are or even do that's just where they're located by market cap so the default asset is Bitcoin but this one might not it might not make the most sense to spend a lot of time looking at because if you're daydreaming about Bitcoin going to you know to a higher price then you're probably not looking at it compared to other assets because it's number one by market cap okay but it does show you like if Bitcoin had the market cap of other cryptocurrencies where would the price be so like if Bitcoin had the market cap of eth then the price of Bitcoin would be at like 14k but I don't really think a lot of people are are interested in that aspect of this chart you could go to ethereum and see what would the price of ethereum be if it had the market cap of Bitcoin and the hypothetical price would be 6.83k now one thing I will remind you is that even if ethereum ever went to the market cap of Bitcoin today which I think it probably would eventually note that bitcoin's market cap would likely be higher if ethereum's market cap is where Bitcoin is today I don't believe that ethereum is going to flip Bitcoin at least not in the in the near future right I know a lot of people are are very um Pro that but you you think about ethereum it it has been putting in higher lows against Bitcoin since you know basically since it's been around macro higher lows when you think about it but this also been putting in lower highs since 2017 and so if it were to ever do something like that which I'm really skeptical of but if it were then I I I I would imagine it would be you know many many years away for something like that to happen so if a the were ever at the market cap of Bitcoin in my mind it would imply that bitcoin's market cap is actually quite a bit larger but I I think where this gets more interesting is if you go down the list right and and you you really go down the list and look at various cryptocurrencies and and kind of see where they fit in for instance like if we were to go down to say salana it'll show you where you know I mean it'll show you basically what the price would be if it had the market cap of various assets so essentially it shows you the latest price and so you know if salana had the market cap of xrp then the price of salana would be $65 therefore it implies that the market cap of salana is greater than xrp if salana had the market cap of BNB then it would be $107 if I had the market cap of Ethan it' be $631 if it had the market cap of madic it would be $16 if you were to look at xrp right you can go through the same type of exercise um cardano right same type of exercise like if it if Ada had the market cap of of avalanche then it'd be at 34 cents but if it had the market cap of xrp then it would be at 81 cents so we know that ADA then comes right in between here xrp and Avalanche and again I mean you can you can go all the way up the list right like if a had the market cap of salana then it'd be a buck 15 if it had the market cap of B&B than it' be 133 just to provide maybe one more example a couple more examples maybe Avalanche right like so if Avalanche had the had the market cap of ADA then it would put it at $46 if it had the market cap of B&B then it' put it at $126 if it had the market cap of Litecoin then it'd put it all the way down at $13 so I think a lot of us get so focused on on sort of the price and and what is price doing um but it's important to remember that like when you put out a price prediction if your price prediction for that asset is much higher than bitcoin's current you know if if the price suggests a market cap of that cryptocurrency that is orders of you know that's multiples above bitcoin's current market cap then it's likely not going to happen right it's like back in early 2021 when a lot of people were were calling for you know cardano for Ada to go to $50 and it's like guys like that's that's not going to happen that would imply it going to higher much higher than bitcoin's market cap and you know it's like I I know that you guys are bullish but I mean you also have to be grounded in your expectations you know there's there's all sorts of predictions out there that they sort of come out to play even even Bitcoin you know there were all sorts of predictions of calling for 300K back in the last cycle I'm sure a lot of people remember all those 300K predictions that were you know everywhere in early 2021 and then what happened right what happened to all those predictions they were wrong and Bitcoin didn't even go anywhere near 300K and the reason that you know I suspected that it wouldn't go there was because of the idea of diminishing returns right from one cycle to another to go to 300K that cycle would have implied that it had the same Roi in the last cycle as it did the cycle before and that hasn't happened before not saying it can't ever happen but that was the reasoning behind thinking it wouldn't go to 300K was because it would imply the returns for two cycles in a row would be the same that doesn't really make sense when the market cap was so much higher and we know it just takes you know exponen exponentially more money to move the asset if you look at at at polka dot you know the the current price of polka dot is is 670 if it had the market cap of of ADA then the market cap would be about $13 so I mean it shows you that A's market cap is about twice that of polka dots and it shows you you know which which assets have been stronger over the last few years right like if it had the market cap of xrp it'd be $21 if it had the market cap of BNB it'd be $35 if it had the market cap of ethereum it'd be $26 right it shows you where the where the price would be if it had the market cap of this other cryptocurrency so when you think about about things like price and like if something looks cheaper to you just because it's like a smaller value it's more important to look at at the market cap right like it doesn't make sense to go say Hey you know you know this cryptocurrency has a lower price than another cryptocurrency therefore it's going to catch up no I mean you should look at market cap now I know a lot of people will go out and say well you know there's going to be some people that will buy the asset just because it it has a lower price but I mean while there may be some elements of that that are true I I I still think in the end market cap is much more important and market cap will give us a better guide as to as to whether that is theoretically possible now remember it also depends on where bitcoin's market cap is so if you're at a position where you think that Bitcoin has topped out right let's say at some point you think all right Bitcoin is topped out and and my altcoin is going to run for a few weeks before everything comes you know crumbling back down right like let's imagine this scenario in the future if bitcoin's market cap is at a certain level and you don't think it's going to go any higher but you think your altcoin is going to go to a price that would mean 5x of bitcoin's current market cap then you know that's an outrageous prediction right and you know that if you hold out for such a price you will likely end up holding those bags for a long time and then hoping that the altcoin eventually returns to to new alltime highs most of the time a lot of altcoins don't there are some altcoins that do I know a lot of altcoins have had sizable rallies over the last few months and congratulations to those who have who have made gains on them but how many of them have put in new highs how many of them are anywhere remotely close to their prior highs right I mean bitcoin's kind of close um all things considered like it's not I mean it's in the' 40s and the high was at 69k but a lot of altcoins are still down you know 60% or more and unfortunately a lot of altcoins will they'll stay like that right there will be some that that likely reclaim their their all-time highs and there will likely be a lot of new altcoins that end up being the focus of of you know of of future Cycles but this is one tool that I think can be helpful for people um to navigate the market right and and and maybe just to provide a couple more examples uh here's chain link so if chain link had the market cap of ADA then chain Link's market cap or chain Link's price would be at $30 if it had the market cap of of salana then it would be at $71 and if Cosmos if Adam had the market cap of avalanche it would put it at $31 if it had the market cap of salana it would put it $15 if it had the market cap of Litecoin it would put it at $13 so this is a tool that just lets your imagination run for a little bit right to think about like what is possible right you know if you think about like an altcoin and and you're you know you're you're comparing it let's say it's like number 15 or 16 by market cap and you want to know is it possible for this you know for this asset to go to this price maybe just go look at some of the other altcoins that you think are you know relevant competition and if those assets have market caps that correspond to that price you're wanting then maybe it's possible but if the market cap of that that corresponding price corresponds to you know to bitcoin's market cap right then it's not it's likely not happening because as as much as you want your altcoin to be a competitor to bitcoin it's not it's just not and the truth is it likely never will be that's just the way the market works you know Bitcoin has been number one the entire time and yeah I mean I get people are going to say well you know what if it's the you know sort of the the AOL of the internet right like what if it's it's like the the Myspace of of social media I mean you can make those comparisons if you want to but I don't think this falls into that into that comparison a lot of those other things only were at the top for a few years I mean Bitcoin has been at the top since 2009 I mean you're you're talking about 15 years right at what point at what point do we just say hey it's it's it's unlikely that your altcoin is going to flip Bitcoin right and and again like it that seems like the the the the most logical conclusion to come to right like it's unlikely that's going to happen therefore if you're daydreaming about a price that you want your altcoin to go to look at bitcoin's market cap and say hey if bitcoin's market cap is there then probably not going to make it there right and in reality you know it probably won't even make it to you know to half of bitcoin's market cap right you know some have gotten close at various points um especially ethereum but um that's sort of the reality of of the situation is that you know most of them aren't going to go to like 80 90% of bitcoin's market cap even that and and they'd be lucky to get to 50% right I mean ethereum has has reached that Milestone and I think a few other altcoins have various points as well but it's just something to keep in mind so again this tool it's

      "Hi, the eth Bitcoin ratio has fallen if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom links in the description below we have a website with thousands of charts for hundreds of different cryptocurrencies so make sure you guys check that out again the sale will end at after the having let's go Ahad and jump in so the eth Bitcoin ratio is something that I have been tracking about as long as my channel has been around I find the eth Bitcoin ratio really useful in terms of navigating various phases of the market cycle if you have an edge on where you think think e Bitcoin on where e Bitcoin is going to go then theoretically you have an edge on where then Bitcoin dominance is going to go and how to adjust your portfolio to maximize your risk adjusted returns we have just had a major event happen in the cryptoverse but I think it is largely gone unnoticed so far but I do think it will become more evident in the coming weeks so this video is going to first go through the eth Bitcoin ratio and my prior views on it we will then talk about the implications on you know the USD valuation of eth and then finally I will talk a little bit about a potential path for eth Bitcoin to finally bottom out so before we get too far into this you know one of the things that inevitably happens when I post these videos is you know the the Bitcoin Maxi talk comes out they just say oh he's just a Bitcoin Maxi but let me just go through you know a few of my prior thoughts in the video are on on on eth bitcoin so I actually the the first video you will find on my channel the first two in fact are primarily on the eth Bitcoin valuation here's one here's the first one this is the oldest video on my channel e ethereum timing the longterm momentum shifts we are in a very strong by region so so in the video I talk about how eth Bitcoin was significantly undervalued at 02 and that it was a strong by region and that we were likely going to spend the next sever several years seeing the eth Bitcoin valuation go up I Then followed it up in my next video where I said it I just made the title eth Bitcoin is severely undervalued you can see that right before ethereum takes off you know at least in the last cycle it likes to hug this 20we moving average for a bit and that's what we're so we were making all the same comparisons for the prior cycle and talking about how it was likely going to enter into a major uptrend so it's important for me to say this because inevitably whenever I post a video on the eth Bitcoin valuation what people will say is that zoom out you know and and look at the chart and and they sort of point out these higher lows and my only point you know is that it's a market right and yes I was I was bullish on it over here but just like anything in the market nothing ever goes straight up straight up nothing goes straight down it's okay to Pivot your view if the market changes and so then I pivoted my view when we started to notice that ethereum's Bitcoin valuation was looking awfully similar similar to the Bitcoin USD woff distribution so why are we talking about this well the problem is that you could argue the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is so is showing some similarities right these so we talk about how the eth Bitcoin valuation was showing similarities to the Bitcoin USD wof distribution woff distribution and this was when it was at 073 now after that we saw it collapse all the way down 2.05 this collapse is actually a very common collapse that happens between two major Peaks so if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about look at the eth Bitcoin valuations weekly candles and you will see a very familiar pattern that has happened now a third time and is in the process of of still happening and that pattern namely is that you get a Peak you then set a low you then get a slightly lower high you then come back down to the low spend some months trying to hold it as support but ultimately you fail and then we go into final capitulation that lasts for two or three months you will see the same thing happened over here you set a peak you set a low then you set a secondary Peak where it is a lower high you come back down to the low you try to hold it for a few months but you fail to and then you capitulate for two to three months before setting the bottom the same thing has happened once again where you have a peak you set a low you then set a secondary Peak that's a lower high you then bleed back down to the low and you try to hold it for a few months but you fail and then you bleed below that that low and then you capitulate for a few months this is the general Trend the general path that the eth Bitcoin valuation takes and so in this video when we talked about this this distribution phase what ended up happening is we did go back down we went down we set a low then we went right back up to set a secondary distribution phase we can see similarities in these two charts for instance you not only do you have the wof distribution phase but you also have this this potential double top that's occurr so we talked about how the E Bitcoin valuation back then was essentially mimicking the Bitcoin USD secondary distribution phase where it had a double top in late 2021 right so you can see that it had these four tops and then a double top over here sort of your one two p and then it bled back down to the range lows tried to hold it and then once it failed to hold it it capitulated and we said back then that it looks like the same thing is happening where eth Bitcoin had a secondary distribution phase right you had your first distribution phase here and then a secondary distribution phase up here where you have your little one2 top bleed back down to the range lows and then finally capitulate just like Bitcoin USD capitulated here in June of 2022 so this whole process that we've been talking about has been playing out but it's been playing out over a very long period of time so we started off with saying timing this long-term momentum shift at at at 0.02 saying it's severely undervalued at 0.0019 or whatever it was at here then acknowledging look it looks like a distribution phase up at Point 73 and then at the merge when it was at 0083 saying look this looks to be like a secondary distribution phase do you guys remember what it was like at the merge all the eth Maxis were calling for the flipping some of them were calling for it to double up bitcoin's market cap it was absolutely delusional right and every step of the way I mean every throughout this entire process we've seen nothing but lower high after lower high and every time that it happens it draws more people back in it leads to a lot of like taunting and mocking but they've all just been lower highs right they've all just been lower highs and now after watching eth Bitcoin bleed for two and a half years from this high it has finally broken support this is a major milestone in the crypto verse for those who care to pay attention to it I wish I had paid closer attention to it in Prior Cycles now there's something we have to talk about here okay and that is what are the implications of it going forward and what are the implications of it on its USD valuation because while I have tried to spend hours and hours and hours convincing people that the Bitcoin valuation of these cryptocurrencies is the only thing that matters I've failed at convincing everyone and so a lot of people still do care about its USD evaluation and I'm not going to necessarily I mean I will provide my opinion but I'm just going to show you what happened the last two times that e Bitcoin closed below this major support level it's happened twice before okay it happened here in November of October of 2016 October November of 2016 and then it happened over here in June July of 2019 so it's happened two times before what did ethusd do during that time so if you were to Overlay ethusd onto this chart what we're going to do is just say what did it do after the breakdown occurred okay So Below when it when it went first below the range low from this Wick right here so you can see that it went below the range low in October of 2016 if we zoom in we can maybe see it a little bit closer so you can see it right right here it went below the range low in October of 2016 when it went below the range low in October of 2016 you can see that October was down 18% November it was down 21.5% and then December it went down 5. 6% by the week by the monthly close however the whole move here from October through December Sal ethusd dropped 54% 54% all right that's one example now following that drop we know what happened next right this is one example by the way in this example when ethusd dropped Bitcoin actually went up if you were to Overlay Bitcoin USD onto this chart you'll see that Bitcoin didn't really care about what eth was doing during that time it just went up okay now look at the second time this happened where eth Bitcoin fell below support it happened in July of 2019 now what happened to ethusd starting then well you can see that on this USD pair at dropped out 1 month before and then it bled down 75% now I know what you're thinking that was a pandemic drop that caused it to drop 75% I would say it gives you insight into what could happen if a recession occurs right regardless of what triggers it whether it's a Black Swan or whether it's just a slow long progression of the yield curve and all that stuff if we ignore that let's just suppose we get a landing and there's no recession right which is a big assumption but let's just for a minute suppose that that's true even in that case even before the pandemic was a thing eth still dropped 68% from the highs when eth Bitcoin broke down so you have two examples of eth breaking down and really measured from this top here in September it actually dropped around 60% so you have two examples where when eth Bitcoin broke down as measured from the previous local top on ethusd eth dropped 60% if you actually take it from this top over here you can see it was closer to a 72% drop and this one remember was about a 75% drop so what do you notice when eth Bitcoin breaks down it has never been good for ethusd even when Bitcoin went up now in the second case over here Bitcoin actually went down right so so in this case Bitcoin went down in 2019 in 2016 Bitcoin went up so what does that show you it shows you that no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD Bitcoin dominance went up during those times and eth Bitcoin went down e Bitcoin went down and so the question is is what does that mean this time because so many people out there right and I I it's almost scary how how how many people are saying it right so many people out there are Shilling memes and and outright scams and they're being paid to do it and they do it over and over and over again and their followers follow them and they get wrecked and then they just keep on doing it because there's always some other 100x gem that they're going to recommend that they were paid to recommend okay now for a while people just assume it's okay and that nothing is nothing bad is happening but this is a major event that eth Bitcoin has fallen it's a major event and I think not enough people are are paying attention to it they're focused on other things they're focused on the the latest meme coin craze they're rationalizing why their altcoins are down 30 to 40% over the last couple of weeks this is a major event I know it's a meme guy I me get it I get it but if you look at the logarithmic regression trend line for eth fit to to non-bubble data you will see that after eth Bitcoin broke down here and here eusd went to the lower logarithmic regression trend line or home if you will that's what happened and I can't help but wonder why should this time be any different because as we saw over here eth USD dropped from the local high 72% over here even if you don't worry about the pandemic it still dropped about 66 67% if you include the recession 73 or 72% or so if you take this from here from 4K a 70% drop puts you exactly at the fair value logarithmic aggression trend line that's where it would put ethereum and I don't know why we should assume this time is any different one thing to consider is that you know I know a lot of people are talking about a left translated cycle and so as I've said before I'm not completely unsympathetic to that view I'm not but I don't for for me I still think if you want exposure to crypto I I think Bitcoin makes more sense than ethereum right now now that doesn't mean that Bitcoin can't collapse I think it probably will get a pretty big drop um at at some point especially as as the yield curve un inverts but I don't know exactly when that's going to be um we do know that last cycle Bitcoin topped out about a month before the First Rate cut I know the First Rate cut is getting priced further and further out but I think that the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in I've explained what I mean by that before I really want to spend a ton of time explaining that again so ethusd potentially is starting to turn the corner here and what's actually fascinating about ethusd when you look at it on its USD pair when it broke down against Bitcoin last time the pattern is almost identical we have this wedge that ethusd broke out of right we have this wedge ethusd broke out of it topped eth Bitcoin broke down right there eth USD then fell back through the wedge right it fell back through the wedge now look at it over here it's the same thing you have a wedge that ethusd was in for a long time and now eth Bitcoin has broken down ethusd is starting to correct and it looks like it's potentially going to correct right through the wedge just like it did over here which by the way occurred as those rate Cuts finally arrived so I don't really care what the CME Market tool thing is is showing for when rate cuts are going to occur I look at this and say if this keeps on dropping like this it represents a consumer that is starting to falter and therefore it will likely not take until November or September for a rate cut I could see a rate cut coming this Summer Okay so this pattern to me looks like it's playing out once again I have said forever that after eth Bitcoin breaks down we will likely see ethusd fall back through this wedge to me it looks like it is finally happening so I think that it makes a lot of sense to view the market view ethusd through the lens of eth Bitcoin and the reason for that is over the last two and a half years if you wanted exposure to crypto then you have to figure out what you're going to buy and of course if you're if you're a full Deen and you're you're buying micro cap stuff you're probably not really interested in what I have to say anyways but if you're not as risky if you don't want to take on as much risk um if you're dealing with say a significant amount of money um a large percentage of your of your funds are going into high you know some of these risky assets and you don't want to speculate too much out of the top you know top cup two or three maybe the top 10 then understanding these patterns are I think very important to navigate the cryptoverse in a successful way and so over the last two and a half years if you wanted exposure to crypto and you decided what do you want to buy do you want to buy Bitcoin or eth my view for the last two and a half years is that Bitcoin is the better play because it will likely hit new all-time highs first which it did it will likely not be subject to as much regulation risk as ethereum and also guess what during quantitative tightening e Bitcoin bleeds and it's as simple as that and you know I've seen all sorts of narratives out there that are saying that well proof of stake has failed or that you know there's all these other things there's no evidence of that yet actually there really isn't this is all just monetary policy stuff there's no evidence of any of that yet I think Bitcoin has stood the test of time well and I hope that ethereum does but everything that you've seen happen since November 202 1 is an artifact of monetary policy nothing more so it might lead people to believe that proof of stake is failing when in reality it's just an artifact of tighter monetary policy which is exactly what we saw last cycle in fact during quantitative tightening last cycle we saw the eth Bitcoin valuation bleed in fact if you were to Overlay Bitcoin USD onto this chart you will find that we had a bull market in 2019 and during that bull market Bitcoin did not put in a new high but eth Bitcoin went down because the Fed was still doing quantitative tightening what marked the bottom for eth Bitcoin what marked the bottom it was precisely when the fed pivoted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing that was the bottom it wasn't any more complicated than that it wasn't the narratives that you could have come up with back then it had nothing to do with what some YouTuber was saying about whether it was going to just go to zero or something all it had to do was was was the FED printing money or not was the FED reducing the size of the balance sheet or were they increasing the size of the balance sheet that's what it came down to and once again everyone's trying to over complicate it and come up with a thous different narratives for why it's happening and I said a long time ago that this was what's going to happen when it breaks down people will find a reason and of course the reason that people are looking at is regulation risk which is what we said a long time ago some of the reg regulation news that we've seen recently and also the potential rejection of the spot ETF for ethereum none of that stuff matters none of it matters ethereum has been fine without a spot ETF forever it's not going to die if it if it's rejected I think ethereum's valuation against the US dollar is going down but not because of the spot ETF eth went to $4,800 without a spot ETF I think eth USD is going to go down because eth Bitcoin has broken support it is broken below the June 2022 low and that is the important thing to consider you know if you if you don't follow it too closely we can look very closely at it here the low in June of 2022 for eth Bitcoin was 0.409 so if you draw a line across the page at 0409 so we're going to get a line here 040 well let me get it exact right here there you have it 0049 that was the low and what I said was that we will get a weekly close below the range low and when we do that is when ethereum finally starts to go down on its USD valuation and you can see eth Bitcoin is capitulating below the range low ethusd is starting to capitulate as well last cycle the first month that ethusd fell after e Bitcoin topped a 25% drop by the monthly close a 25% drop by the monthly close for eth this time would put it at around 2700 give or take a 100 or so you know because I didn't really get that accurate there about 27 let's just say 27 2800 something like that 26 2800 because it's not going to be exact anyways just because it was 25 here doesn't mean it has to be 25 here but then where it became brutal was while a lot of people assumed that it would be a buy the dip opportunity the following month after eth Bitcoin broke down it dropped another 21% right so imagine if ethusd first drops that 25% to get it down to 2700 and then drops another 21% from there where does that put e coincidentally it puts it at $2,000 right at 2K and what you'll notice is after it had this drop it then tried to hold that as support for a little while right and that support level that it tried to hold was also the the resistance level back over here it was the resistance level this resistance level was 2K right so my guess is that this summer and probably as maybe even as soon as May in fact May or June I think we will see there's a there's a high likelihood we will see eth at 2K if I'm wrong it's because Bitcoin is getting some type of left translated cycle and it's just dragging eth up with it right and in that case case while technically I would be wrong about about ethusd you would still be better off with Bitcoin than ethereum okay I wish I had known this stuff in Prior Cycles it's not like anyone told me I learned the hard way and I was hoping to help other people not go through that and that's why I've been talking about the Bitcoin dominance forever and all Bitcoin pairs forever so 2K is the level that I think eth is going to correct down to after the Bitcoin having from there it will probably try to hold it as support is my guess but I also think that it will fail to hold it as support and I do think it will eventually go to the lower logarithmic regression trend line if you look at a lot of these bottoming processes for ethereum what you'll notice notice is that it doesn't just tend to put in one low and then never revisit it right you can see over here it put in a low and then it got pretty close to testing it a while later if you just look at monthly closes you can see that these monthly closes we eventually Wicked below the monthly closes you can see over here these monthly closes we eventually went below them right so once again I think eth will eventually go back below these levels and and go back to the lower logarithmic regression trend line especially now that eth Bitcoin has fallen so just as everyone is getting hyped up for the Bitcoin having and and all the things that come with it what happens if this plays out and instead of getting a left translated Peak like everyone's talking about what happens if we just bleed after it for 6 months and we just see ethusd go back to the lower logarithmic aggression trend line we had a we had a 9month bare Market over here after eth Bitcoin broke down if you ignore the pandemic we had a six-month bare market after eth Bitcoin broke down why can't that happen again Bitcoin when Bitcoin sneezes the rest of the market gets extremely sick take a look at where Bitcoin is this cycle okay as measured Peak to Peak as measured Peak to Peak you can see how far ahead of schedule we are I mean we are so far ahead of schedule right now Bitcoin has never been this heat of going into the having it's always been the last two cycles Bitcoin was 60% below its high when we went into the having if Bitcoin falls back into line with the last couple of Cycles what happens to eth you know I mean you can see that eth Bitcoin is going down right so if Bitcoin USD goes back to where it was previously let's say Bitcoin goes back to where it was just say like I don't know half a year ago but instead of eth Bitcoin being up here it's all the way down here then ethusd gets hit a lot harder right that's the reason why the Bitcoin valuations are important if you take the inverse of one over if you take the inverse of e Bitcoin so you're looking at the Bitcoin eth valuation what do you notice over here one Bitcoin would have gotten you about 11 to 12 eth now it gets you 20 eth I think it's going to go out pretty high here and potentially get you know 32 E when it's all said and done now when you look at eth Bitcoin there's a case to be made that it's either on a logarithmic regression path or it's an oscillator okay so the logarithmic regression path would be viewed like this something like that meaning even if you're a long-term Bull on the eth Bitcoin valuation which I've said many many times like I can understand why you might be I mean these are technically higher lows but even if you are it's still likely is going to go down to the 03 to 04 range before you figure out if the higher lows are important or if the lower Highs are more important because everyone on X whenever I post anything about the eth Bitcoin valuation they will tell me well you're ignoring the higher low I'm not ignoring anything you know I've pointed them out a million times but the reality is that you have higher lows here but eth Bitcoin has also not seen a new high since 2017 that's a long time you know imagine if like Bitcoin hadn't seen a new all-time high since 2017 you know how people give uh the gold bugs a hard time because gold took like 10 years to put on a new all-time high I mean who are you talking to if you're an eth maxi you have no room to stand really here because it's been bleeding against Bitcoin since 2017 yes eusd has gone to new Highs but so what you still you know it still was lower highs against Bitcoin sure as measured from the bottom e outperforms Bitcoin in a QE bull market how many people have said over the last two and a half years that you know just you wait e outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market it outperforms Bitcoin in a QE bull market but in a qt bull market e Bitcoin gets annihilated in fact if you look at quarterly returns for eth Bitcoin the last if you include this quarter which is just started the last six quarters have been red you know that's not the definition of holding up well that's the definition of a slow and painful bleed where retail investors keep capitulating because they they're changing their mind about it and I think that eth Bitcoin has entered into the final capitulation phase so I don't know exactly how long it's going to take to find a bottom I can tell you that the last couple of times it took about two to three months okay so here you can see we broke down in like October it bottomed out about two months later here it broke down in Ju July it bottomed out about 2 months later about 8 weeks in fact so there is a case to be made that it could bottom in June right there's a case to be made that it could um again it's probably going to be dependent on when the FED pivots If the Fed doesn't pivot until later then it could take longer for it to bottom in fact while it did bottom in June it still or sorry over here while it bottomed in August and then basically put in a double bottom in December now a lot of people will say that I've seen on on X when I post about this they'll say oh so you're just telling me in two more months eth is you know they'll say that they'll their interpretation of me saying that eth Bitcoin might find a bottom this summer their interpretation of that is to then immediately assume that that means eth is going to Skyrocket following that the reality is that even after eth Bitcoin bottomed in August of 2019 eth us D even after eth Bitcoin bottomed ethusd still dropped 47% after that and if you ignore the pandemic it dropped about 30% okay that is going to be the next phase of the market cycle which I think is going to be a difficult phase because do you know how over the last two and a half years I've said that that eth Bitcoin will go down no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD the next phase of the cycle as we get into rate cuts is especially when the FED pivots from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing and E Bitcoin finally finds a bottom probably between 03 to 04 the next phase is me saying that eth Bitcoin goes up no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD the reason why that's going to be challenging is because a lot of people are going to assume that if eth Bitcoin is going up they're going to assume that ethusd is going up but in reality that's not what happened last cycle eth Bitcoin started to go up and put in higher lows and I mean this was a higher low here but ethusd was still going down that's why the last year has been frustrating because Bitcoin dominance has gone up and I said many times that e Bitcoin will bleed no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD and it has but ethusd has gone up so people feel like they missed out my only point was if you want crypto bitcoin's better play than eth so yes maybe you feel like you missed out on eth you still just would have been better off with Bitcoin so you didn't really miss out on anything in fact if you were to go look at a DCA strategy if you had bought Bitcoin $100 of it even since the beginning of 2022 through today you're currently up about 125% had you done the same thing for ethereum you're only up 68% right and if you actually take it from say November of 2022 right if we actually take it from the the the capitulation region or whatever you can see that with eth you'd be up about 69% but with Bitcoin you'd be up 120% so this is why I mean I've learned my lesson you know I've tried really hard to sort of preach the the the talk about Bitcoin dominance and all Bitcoin Pairs and and thinking that I could get to through to some people and I think I have reached some people but I can assure you the next cycle this will not be my goal okay it will not be my goal anymore because I've learned the hard way that people do not care about Bitcoin valuations for the most part they mostly focus on USD valuations and they don't see that eth Bitcoin has dropped 40% from the highs all they care about or 45% from the highs all they care about is the fact that it's gone up recently but I think people are about to find out why the Bitcoin valuation matters it's been fun in games up until this point but eth Bitcoin had not broken support it has broken support now the last two times this happened ethusd had a considerable drop and it lasted for at least a few months over here and then the last cycle it lasted for about half a year so please understand that this is not you know do you think I I mean look guys I really enjoyed talking about e Bitcoin back over here when I was bullish on it in 2019 I really enjoyed it and and everyone liked you know everyone liked me and then I became the bad guy in you know in in 2022 when I pointed out the fact that eth Bitcoin was in a distribution phase and it was very hard for me mentally because I had a lot of friends back then in the ethereum community that essentially turned their back on me and and started you know they they were once people that I communicated with in a good way and in a positive way and because I Chang my view they you know essentially completely changed their opinion about me and it's been very hard dealing with that um and and you know even this video over here I talked about the coming collapse you know talking about it coming back down here and and and continuing to to sort of break down um you know looking at at these various Trends and I you know Market the market is a difficult thing you know because if you're bullish on something and I mean this is maybe some advice for for any of you guys that search your own YouTube channel um it's hard because I I I feel like as as and this is maybe just some Reflections but think as a as a influencer for back lack of better word in the crypto space naturally you're going to be if you're making videos about something you're going to be bullish on it more for for a lot of people right if you're going to start a YouTube channel on an asset class it's not like you're going to start it just to say you know say bad things about it right when you start it you're naturally bullish on it right I started mine in mid 2019 I was bullish on eth bitcoin I saw the opportunity there but as an influencer you either stop making videos as the hero or you do it long enough to become the villain and it's not a fun place to be um it's really not and I I'm I'm happy that this process is is likely almost over but I still think it needs at least a couple more months okay June at the earliest is my guess that eth Bitcoin bottoms out June at the earliest about mid June could be when it finally bottoms out which would be interesting because that's when it bottomed out in 2022 in fact so if you look at it from that perspective what if it just bottoms eight weeks after breaking support just like it did here and just like it did here and if it bottoms eight weeks later after breaking support that puts the bottom in mid June basically maybe early June early let me get this exact because I don't I don't want to tell you guys something this wrong um from the low so we broke it last week so eight weeks later would be the week of June 3 right so I mean if it if it happened by the end of the week right it would be you know June 10th right June 9th June 10th so I could see a compelling case for it essentially bottoming out as early as June but it's also going to be dependent on monetary policy right if we get to June and the FED is still not cutting rates and and they're still not going from quantitative easing to quantitative or quantitative tightening to quantitative easing then it might go on longer and you know it's very possible we just go into a recession um but I I do think my base case at this point in time is that eth Bitcoin bottoms this summer ethusd bleeds a little bit longer and then at some point later this year or early next year the FED will will turn the money printer back on and then you will see a bull you know a a bull phase for the E Bitcoin valuation but I don't think we're there yet I don't and you know this is a long process you can't really rush it we can come up you know everyone's had a thousand different narratives for the last two and a half years as to why I was wrong on the eth Bitcoin valuation the deflationary aspect of it the tokenomics right all the merge proof of stake all these things they said I'm not considering the spot ETF right even after the spot ETF for Bitcoin was launched what happened eth Bitcoin got a pretty big pump and do you guys realize how many people dunked on me then where are they now right because it just keeps on bleeding and now I'm seeing the same thing now people are saying well after the having you know e Bitcoin will will show you what's up but I I don't think so I think it's going to keep on bleeding for the next couple of months maybe bottoming out by mid June at the earliest maybe early to mid June um potentially later depending on on what the FED does those are my views it's been hard expressing them for a while but to be completely honest I I don't apologize for them um this is the entire reason I I mean I I just wanted to help right I just wanted to help the Bitcoin dominant stuff I know it's made me a ton of enemies but I I was just trying to help and and now it's you know it's a it's it's broken out right it really has broken out and I think it's about to go to 60% that's where I think it's going 60% so it can't get to 60% easily if eth Bitcoin doesn't drop and I I do think that eth Bitcoin is going to drop to the 03 to 0.04 range and the reason why you should heed this warning if you don't hold ethereum is because the altcoin market gets wrecked even worse okay so if you look at altcoins from last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down the altcoin market got destroyed frankly um you know if you were to look at at total three and I know everyone's just saying this is a is a dip buying opportunity but I'm I'm over here thinking that this is this right this is when you know this was just before the FED pivoted what if this is the same thing and everyone's just buying the dip on alt as they just slowly bleed back down for the next several months so when eth Bitcoin collapsed last cycle all USD valuations fell 72% so I guess it was actually about the same um as as as eth us so about 72% so 72% drop would actually put alt at a new low can that happen maybe I often come back to this idea that everyone you know that no one's going to like but if their Bitcoin valuation can put in new lows right like if A's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if Dot's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if litecoin's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if maddox's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if all of these different altcoins can put in new lows on their Bitcoin valuations then they can put new lows on their USD valuations too I didn't want to believe it last cycle I really didn't and and that's what happened they put in new lows a lot of them put in new lows so I think that is is is something that is worthwhile to think about you know and I I know I I know these I I hate putting these videos out frankly because then I'm just inundated with with um you know with with people who who troll me back but I don't want to I don't want to say things that don't believe and I learned the lesson the hard way the last cycle and the reality of the situation right the reality the altcoin Reckoning was was always based on their Bitcoin valuations I said that in basically every altcoin Reckoning video the altcoin Reckoning re refers to the devaluation of alt Bitcoin pairs alt Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows what does that mean it means the altcoin Reckoning never ended that's what it means that's my interpretation of it so those are my thoughts about ethereum I've tried to you know to be diplomatic about the US Dev evaluation um in terms of hey it's going to go up if Bitcoin goes up but with eth Bitcoin breaking down I I do feel some very strong conviction that it is is time it is time for ethereum to make the Journey Back to the lower regression band admittedly it has taken a lot longer than I thought I'm not going to pretend like I predicted this perfectly because I haven't and I've been wrong about many many things but the last two cycles that e Bitcoin broke down that is when eth went to the lower logarithmic progression trend line and I just I don't think this time is going to be any different if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe crypt.of this either way um but as we you know as we do get further into the cycle um you know I know a lot of you guys are are wanting me to talk a lot more about altcoins especially as they bought them out against Bitcoin but frankly I don't know I mean I I do want to talk about at least the larger you know the the Bitcoin and ethereum I will talk about those but there's so much there's just so much garbage being shilled everywhere right now that that that people are being paid to do it and it's just it's such a you know such such a disheartening thing honestly like I will get people asking me to uh shill a a micro cap you know a meme coin and they'll offer you know money to do so and I will say no and I will ignore them and I I honestly just typically block them because I I don't really want to talk to those people and then a few days later I will see people on on X Shilling that coin and and I know and they pretend like they just think it's a good coin when in reality I know that they're being paid to do it and they're not disclosing it and then their followers are following them and then they're selling those those they they they were given these allocations in these projects and they're selling those coins to their followers as they promote them and those people get all the accolades because that's what people want they want the 100x gems they want to gamble right but that usually doesn't work right get rich quick schemes really don't work and um you really have to be careful and you know the issue that I found is that so many people in crypto they just they they they forget about it right they'll they'll fall for the scams and then and then they'll get mad at those people that Shield them and then six months later they'll forget about it and fall for the same thing over again so I I really do hope that people stop doing it I hope that people stop following the people that do it because it it makes a joke of the entire industry and I I think that if we're ever going to grow as an industry we really have to get past all the meme coin stuff I'm not saying that you can't have some form of of the Mee coin there's always going to be something there but guys I mean there's like thousands of them right now and and that's why you're seeing Bitcoin dominance go up everyone who was bullish on altcoins this year for the most part told me that Bitcoin dominance had topped so yes some of the altcoins went up on their USD valuations but not because the reasons they thought right Bitcoin went up more um and now if Bitcoin does cool off after the having then then they find out why their altcoins went up and it wasn't because there was anything fundamentally great about it it was just because Bitcoin went up and people were chasing the next great thing but just be careful uh be careful with all those accounts that are are shilling that garbage um out there I want to be clear I don't think ethereum Falls in that category I think ethereum is a legitimate project and my views on its Bitcoin valuation are not a reflection on my fundamental views of ethereum they're just a reflection on monetary policy and that's what makes it so difficult is because you know being bearish on eth bitcoin makes a lot of people assume I'm antie when in reality the very first videos on my channel were bullish on the eth Bitcoin valuation so I've learned a lot I mean as you know just as as a person making content in the crypto space um over the last couple years I'm not really sure if I want to go through that process again next cycle but um that's where we stand we'll see if this if it plays out kind of like it did the last couple of Cycles if I'm wrong which there's a chance I've been wrong about plenty of things I do think that if I am wrong about eusd going back down there it must be because we're getting some type of left translated cycle that's not my base case I my base case is not for a translated cycle it's not um I just think that if we do go uh if it doesn't follow this path then I I think it must be because of a left translated cycle any we'll go and wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in

      "Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing Wikipedia page views if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse docomo that will hopefully help you navigate the crypto verse just a bit better one interesting thing is that we can track social interest I mean we we've done videos on the social risk before but we can track social interest quite easily by looking at you know views to to to YouTube channels and and new followers on Twitter to people that talk about cryptocurrency this is just simply looking at new Wikipedia page views to the to the Bitcoin page and what what's fascinating is that you can see that during the 2017 Peak it spiked quite high and in fact it went a lot higher in 2017 than it did over here in 2021 now there is an explanation for that I think and that is that as crypto has grown as an asset class there's obviously a lot of other cryptocurrencies as well and so while we did not get a spike on the search term or the Wikipedia page for Bitcoin in 2021 if you were to go look at cryptocurrency you can see that there was a very similar spike in 2021 around that first Peak just like there was in 2017 and in fact if you look even recently we've seen it slowly trending back up it looks like it found um at least for the the search the page of cryptocurrency you can see that it found some these lows back in April and it has been trending higher although at least in recent days it's starting to go back down now that the spot ETF stuff is behind us of course with the with the having around the corner we could still see that interest come right back but it might be interesting to Overlay all of them right so now what we're looking at is the sum of you know these pages that look at not only Bitcoin page and the cryptocurrency page but also ethereum as well as many others and when you do that you get a chart that looks like this which is interesting from the perspective of major Peak here on Wikipedia page views in 2017 very similar thing in 2021 but there hasn't really been a whole lot of interest for a while right I mean now price has gone up the price of Bitcoin has gone up but there's not a lot of people searching for cryptocurrency right now so the social interest Still Remains relatively relatively low it's like when we talk about the social risk and you know what is it going to take to get people interested right what is it going to take retail participants interested in crypto again that are not already here you might say well hey I'm interested but there's a difference between say someone that stuck around for all of 2022 and all of 2023 and they're just still here right there's a difference between that type of person and the person that only joined in the first peak of 2021 lost all their money in the summer crash and then just left right and you can see I mean it's it's pretty clear that those people have not returned right you can see that they have not in terms of in terms of search interest and of course this is also seen in in YouTube views and and and throughout various metrics but I think it's an interesting way to look at the cryptoverse to just get an idea of of of where we are in terms of the social sentiment in the space and you know is it trending up is it trending down or is it relatively sideways I think you could argue that uh it was trending down in 2022 or late 2021 trending down throughout most of 2022 but it seems like it's it's been relatively flat um you know for about a year now I mean it it did get some spikes over here going into the spot ETF stuff but it is still it has still been relatively flat a couple of things to note is that this Spike over over here in 2021 of course occurred after the having and it it occurred during loose monetary policy same thing over here this Spike occurred in 2017 it occurred after the having and it occurred during loose monetary policy so perhaps one of the reasons we haven't seen a you know a a similar type of spike is because we are before the having and we have also not seen the shift to looser monetary policy so perhaps those are the two ingredients that you need and it could be sort of representative of the idea that price is not the only thing that brings brings people back I mean Bitcoin has gone up what 3x from the from the from the 2022 lows and and still the search interest for all these cryptocurrencies Still Remains relatively flat so to me it implies that there's something more to it and and that you need you know you need looser monetary policy which conveniently also often corresponds to the having which Maybe by chance maybe by maybe not also happens to be an election year right we talk about like that cyclical behavior of of crypto and and you can kind of see it pretty clearly on this chart that you you get that interest at least in terms of Wikipedia page views to these assets after the having but it also tends to correspond to lose to monetary policy and even in 2019 you can see there was all sorts of positive price action where Bitcoin actually went up more in 2019 than it has throughout this entire rally over here because back over here it went up more than 3x from the lows and you can see that interest still didn't really come back until the very end of the having year right in the early part of the post having year and even over here you can see that while Bitcoin was going up for a while even in the having year it didn't really start to go up until halfway through the post having year so just interesting you know some interesting ways to look at the market hopefully this has been you know insightful uh to you guys to be the market like this again if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium

      "Hi, today we're going to talk about market cap hypotheticals for various cryptocurrencies if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse tocom I do mention into the cryptoverse decom into the cryptoverse premium quite a bit uh but I do want you to be aware that there is a free tier in fact and on that free tier is the DCA simulation tool um and we've also recently added this tool so if you like what you see in the video and you would like to explore what I'm doing but for say um an asset that you hold then you can do that okay you can do that and it and it doesn't cost anything you can just go to the website and sign up I think having some tools available for free uh is is great because it can help people better understand market dynamics it can better understand help people understand you know various strategies that they should they should focus on now this is bit a bit more of of of a fun video someone someone suggested yesterday that I should make some more fun videos occasionally um and I I understand that my my content can get pretty repetitive I know the Bitcoin dominance views are repetitive like you know Bitcoin will basically chop up chop up the altcoin market until the dominance is is much higher and unfortunately I can't speed things along right like those are my views and I don't think those views are going to change until we're on the other side of of rate cuts which probably are going to come within the next few months so at least we have that to look forward to which is nice but in the meantime I I wanted to at least show this chart basically what it is is it's just saying if this cryptocurrency had the market cap of another cryptocurrency what would the price be right what would the price be I think a lot of people have thought about that before you know like if if altcoin a had the market cap of altcoin B then where would the price be and so what this video allows you to do or sorry not what the chart allows you to do is it allows you to select an asset right and going through the first several hundred right maybe a couple hundred almost couple hundred cryptocurrencies now I don't know 99.9 I mean I don't I probably don't even know what like 95% of those cryptocurrencies are or even do that's just where they're located by market cap so the default asset is Bitcoin but this one might not it might not make the most sense to spend a lot of time looking at because if you're daydreaming about Bitcoin going to you know to a higher price then you're probably not looking at it compared to other assets because it's number one by market cap okay but it does show you like if Bitcoin had the market cap of other cryptocurrencies where would the price be so like if Bitcoin had the market cap of eth then the price of Bitcoin would be at like 14k but I don't really think a lot of people are are interested in that aspect of this chart you could go to ethereum and see what would the price of ethereum be if it had the market cap of Bitcoin and the hypothetical price would be 6.83k now one thing I will remind you is that even if ethereum ever went to the market cap of Bitcoin today which I think it probably would eventually note that bitcoin's market cap would likely be higher if ethereum's market cap is where Bitcoin is today I don't believe that ethereum is going to flip Bitcoin at least not in the in the near future right I know a lot of people are are very um Pro that but you you think about ethereum it it has been putting in higher lows against Bitcoin since you know basically since it's been around macro higher lows when you think about it but this also been putting in lower highs since 2017 and so if it were to ever do something like that which I'm really skeptical of but if it were then I I I I would imagine it would be you know many many years away for something like that to happen so if a the were ever at the market cap of Bitcoin in my mind it would imply that bitcoin's market cap is actually quite a bit larger but I I think where this gets more interesting is if you go down the list right and and you you really go down the list and look at various cryptocurrencies and and kind of see where they fit in for instance like if we were to go down to say salana it'll show you where you know I mean it'll show you basically what the price would be if it had the market cap of various assets so essentially it shows you the latest price and so you know if salana had the market cap of xrp then the price of salana would be $65 therefore it implies that the market cap of salana is greater than xrp if salana had the market cap of BNB then it would be $107 if I had the market cap of Ethan it' be $631 if it had the market cap of madic it would be $16 if you were to look at xrp right you can go through the same type of exercise um cardano right same type of exercise like if it if Ada had the market cap of of avalanche then it'd be at 34 cents but if it had the market cap of xrp then it would be at 81 cents so we know that ADA then comes right in between here xrp and Avalanche and again I mean you can you can go all the way up the list right like if a had the market cap of salana then it'd be a buck 15 if it had the market cap of B&B than it' be 133 just to provide maybe one more example a couple more examples maybe Avalanche right like so if Avalanche had the had the market cap of ADA then it would put it at $46 if it had the market cap of B&B then it' put it at $126 if it had the market cap of Litecoin then it'd put it all the way down at $13 so I think a lot of us get so focused on on sort of the price and and what is price doing um but it's important to remember that like when you put out a price prediction if your price prediction for that asset is much higher than bitcoin's current you know if if the price suggests a market cap of that cryptocurrency that is orders of you know that's multiples above bitcoin's current market cap then it's likely not going to happen right it's like back in early 2021 when a lot of people were were calling for you know cardano for Ada to go to $50 and it's like guys like that's that's not going to happen that would imply it going to higher much higher than bitcoin's market cap and you know it's like I I know that you guys are bullish but I mean you also have to be grounded in your expectations you know there's there's all sorts of predictions out there that they sort of come out to play even even Bitcoin you know there were all sorts of predictions of calling for 300K back in the last cycle I'm sure a lot of people remember all those 300K predictions that were you know everywhere in early 2021 and then what happened right what happened to all those predictions they were wrong and Bitcoin didn't even go anywhere near 300K and the reason that you know I suspected that it wouldn't go there was because of the idea of diminishing returns right from one cycle to another to go to 300K that cycle would have implied that it had the same Roi in the last cycle as it did the cycle before and that hasn't happened before not saying it can't ever happen but that was the reasoning behind thinking it wouldn't go to 300K was because it would imply the returns for two cycles in a row would be the same that doesn't really make sense when the market cap was so much higher and we know it just takes you know exponen exponentially more money to move the asset if you look at at at polka dot you know the the current price of polka dot is is 670 if it had the market cap of of ADA then the market cap would be about $13 so I mean it shows you that A's market cap is about twice that of polka dots and it shows you you know which which assets have been stronger over the last few years right like if it had the market cap of xrp it'd be $21 if it had the market cap of BNB it'd be $35 if it had the market cap of ethereum it'd be $26 right it shows you where the where the price would be if it had the market cap of this other cryptocurrency so when you think about about things like price and like if something looks cheaper to you just because it's like a smaller value it's more important to look at at the market cap right like it doesn't make sense to go say Hey you know you know this cryptocurrency has a lower price than another cryptocurrency therefore it's going to catch up no I mean you should look at market cap now I know a lot of people will go out and say well you know there's going to be some people that will buy the asset just because it it has a lower price but I mean while there may be some elements of that that are true I I I still think in the end market cap is much more important and market cap will give us a better guide as to as to whether that is theoretically possible now remember it also depends on where bitcoin's market cap is so if you're at a position where you think that Bitcoin has topped out right let's say at some point you think all right Bitcoin is topped out and and my altcoin is going to run for a few weeks before everything comes you know crumbling back down right like let's imagine this scenario in the future if bitcoin's market cap is at a certain level and you don't think it's going to go any higher but you think your altcoin is going to go to a price that would mean 5x of bitcoin's current market cap then you know that's an outrageous prediction right and you know that if you hold out for such a price you will likely end up holding those bags for a long time and then hoping that the altcoin eventually returns to to new alltime highs most of the time a lot of altcoins don't there are some altcoins that do I know a lot of altcoins have had sizable rallies over the last few months and congratulations to those who have who have made gains on them but how many of them have put in new highs how many of them are anywhere remotely close to their prior highs right I mean bitcoin's kind of close um all things considered like it's not I mean it's in the' 40s and the high was at 69k but a lot of altcoins are still down you know 60% or more and unfortunately a lot of altcoins will they'll stay like that right there will be some that that likely reclaim their their all-time highs and there will likely be a lot of new altcoins that end up being the focus of of you know of of future Cycles but this is one tool that I think can be helpful for people um to navigate the market right and and and maybe just to provide a couple more examples uh here's chain link so if chain link had the market cap of ADA then chain Link's market cap or chain Link's price would be at $30 if it had the market cap of of salana then it would be at $71 and if Cosmos if Adam had the market cap of avalanche it would put it at $31 if it had the market cap of salana it would put it $15 if it had the market cap of Litecoin it would put it at $13 so this is a tool that just lets your imagination run for a little bit right to think about like what is possible right you know if you think about like an altcoin and and you're you know you're you're comparing it let's say it's like number 15 or 16 by market cap and you want to know is it possible for this you know for this asset to go to this price maybe just go look at some of the other altcoins that you think are you know relevant competition and if those assets have market caps that correspond to that price you're wanting then maybe it's possible but if the market cap of that that corresponding price corresponds to you know to bitcoin's market cap right then it's not it's likely not happening because as as much as you want your altcoin to be a competitor to bitcoin it's not it's just not and the truth is it likely never will be that's just the way the market works you know Bitcoin has been number one the entire time and yeah I mean I get people are going to say well you know what if it's the you know sort of the the AOL of the internet right like what if it's it's like the the Myspace of of social media I mean you can make those comparisons if you want to but I don't think this falls into that into that comparison a lot of those other things only were at the top for a few years I mean Bitcoin has been at the top since 2009 I mean you're you're talking about 15 years right at what point at what point do we just say hey it's it's it's unlikely that your altcoin is going to flip Bitcoin right and and again like it that seems like the the the the most logical conclusion to come to right like it's unlikely that's going to happen therefore if you're daydreaming about a price that you want your altcoin to go to look at bitcoin's market cap and say hey if bitcoin's market cap is there then probably not going to make it there right and in reality you know it probably won't even make it to you know to half of bitcoin's market cap right you know some have gotten close at various points um especially ethereum but um that's sort of the reality of of the situation is that you know most of them aren't going to go to like 80 90% of bitcoin's market cap even that and and they'd be lucky to get to 50% right I mean ethereum has has reached that Milestone and I think a few other altcoins have various points as well but it's just something to keep in mind so again this tool it's free right it's free and you can access it via into the Crypt premium link is in the description below just sign up for

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLkNGuLT38E\\n\\nHi, the eth Bitcoin ratio has fallen if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom links in the description below we have a website with thousands of charts for hundreds of different cryptocurrencies so make sure you guys check that out again the sale will end at after the having let's go Ahad and jump in so the eth Bitcoin ratio is something that I have been tracking about as long as my channel has been around I find the eth Bitcoin ratio really useful in terms of navigating various phases of the market cycle if you have an edge on where you think think e Bitcoin on where e Bitcoin is going to go then theoretically you have an edge on where then Bitcoin dominance is going to go and how to adjust your portfolio to maximize your risk adjusted returns we have just had a major event happen in the cryptoverse but I think it is largely gone unnoticed so far but I do think it will become more evident in the coming weeks so this video is going to first go through the eth Bitcoin ratio and my prior views on it we will then talk about the implications on you know the USD valuation of eth and then finally I will talk a little bit about a potential path for eth Bitcoin to finally bottom out so before we get too far into this you know one of the things that inevitably happens when I post these videos is you know the the Bitcoin Maxi talk comes out they just say oh he's just a Bitcoin Maxi but let me just go through you know a few of my prior thoughts in the video are on on on eth bitcoin so I actually the the first video you will find on my channel the first two in fact are primarily on the eth Bitcoin valuation here's one here's the first one this is the oldest video on my channel e ethereum timing the longterm momentum shifts we are in a very strong by region so so in the video I talk about how eth Bitcoin was significantly undervalued at 02 and that it was a strong by region and that we were likely going to spend the next sever several years seeing the eth Bitcoin valuation go up I Then followed it up in my next video where I said it I just made the title eth Bitcoin is severely undervalued you can see that right before ethereum takes off you know at least in the last cycle it likes to hug this 20we moving average for a bit and that's what we're so we were making all the same comparisons for the prior cycle and talking about how it was likely going to enter into a major uptrend so it's important for me to say this because inevitably whenever I post a video on the eth Bitcoin valuation what people will say is that zoom out you know and and look at the chart and and they sort of point out these higher lows and my only point you know is that it's a market right and yes I was I was bullish on it over here but just like anything in the market nothing ever goes straight up straight up nothing goes straight down it's okay to Pivot your view if the market changes and so then I pivoted my view when we started to notice that ethereum's Bitcoin valuation was looking awfully similar similar to the Bitcoin USD woff distribution so why are we talking about this well the problem is that you could argue the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is so is showing some similarities right these so we talk about how the eth Bitcoin valuation was showing similarities to the Bitcoin USD wof distribution woff distribution and this was when it was at 073 now after that we saw it collapse all the way down 2.05 this collapse is actually a very common collapse that happens between two major Peaks so if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about look at the eth Bitcoin valuations weekly candles and you will see a very familiar pattern that has happened now a third time and is in the process of of still happening and that pattern namely is that you get a Peak you then set a low you then get a slightly lower high you then come back down to the low spend some months trying to hold it as support but ultimately you fail and then we go into final capitulation that lasts for two or three months you will see the same thing happened over here you set a peak you set a low then you set a secondary Peak where it is a lower high you come back down to the low you try to hold it for a few months but you fail to and then you capitulate for two to three months before setting the bottom the same thing has happened once again where you have a peak you set a low you then set a secondary Peak that's a lower high you then bleed back down to the low and you try to hold it for a few months but you fail and then you bleed below that that low and then you capitulate for a few months this is the general Trend the general path that the eth Bitcoin valuation takes and so in this video when we talked about this this distribution phase what ended up happening is we did go back down we went down we set a low then we went right back up to set a secondary distribution phase we can see similarities in these two charts for instance you not only do you have the wof distribution phase but you also have this this potential double top that's occurr so we talked about how the E Bitcoin valuation back then was essentially mimicking the Bitcoin USD secondary distribution phase where it had a double top in late 2021 right so you can see that it had these four tops and then a double top over here sort of your one two p and then it bled back down to the range lows tried to hold it and then once it failed to hold it it capitulated and we said back then that it looks like the same thing is happening where eth Bitcoin had a secondary distribution phase right you had your first distribution phase here and then a secondary distribution phase up here where you have your little one2 top bleed back down to the range lows and then finally capitulate just like Bitcoin USD capitulated here in June of 2022 so this whole process that we've been talking about has been playing out but it's been playing out over a very long period of time so we started off with saying timing this long-term momentum shift at at at 0.02 saying it's severely undervalued at 0.0019 or whatever it was at here then acknowledging look it looks like a distribution phase up at Point 73 and then at the merge when it was at 0083 saying look this looks to be like a secondary distribution phase do you guys remember what it was like at the merge all the eth Maxis were calling for the flipping some of them were calling for it to double up bitcoin's market cap it was absolutely delusional right and every step of the way I mean every throughout this entire process we've seen nothing but lower high after lower high and every time that it happens it draws more people back in it leads to a lot of like taunting and mocking but they've all just been lower highs right they've all just been lower highs and now after watching eth Bitcoin bleed for two and a half years from this high it has finally broken support this is a major milestone in the crypto verse for those who care to pay attention to it I wish I had paid closer attention to it in Prior Cycles now there's something we have to talk about here okay and that is what are the implications of it going forward and what are the implications of it on its USD valuation because while I have tried to spend hours and hours and hours convincing people that the Bitcoin valuation of these cryptocurrencies is the only thing that matters I've failed at convincing everyone and so a lot of people still do care about its USD evaluation and I'm not going to necessarily I mean I will provide my opinion but I'm just going to show you what happened the last two times that e Bitcoin closed below this major support level it's happened twice before okay it happened here in November of October of 2016 October November of 2016 and then it happened over here in June July of 2019 so it's happened two times before what did ethusd do during that time so if you were to Overlay ethusd onto this chart what we're going to do is just say what did it do after the breakdown occurred okay So Below when it when it went first below the range low from this Wick right here so you can see that it went below the range low in October of 2016 if we zoom in we can maybe see it a little bit closer so you can see it right right here it went below the range low in October of 2016 when it went below the range low in October of 2016 you can see that October was down 18% November it was down 21.5% and then December it went down 5. 6% by the week by the monthly close however the whole move here from October through December Sal ethusd dropped 54% 54% all right that's one example now following that drop we know what happened next right this is one example by the way in this example when ethusd dropped Bitcoin actually went up if you were to Overlay Bitcoin USD onto this chart you'll see that Bitcoin didn't really care about what eth was doing during that time it just went up okay now look at the second time this happened where eth Bitcoin fell below support it happened in July of 2019 now what happened to ethusd starting then well you can see that on this USD pair at dropped out 1 month before and then it bled down 75% now I know what you're thinking that was a pandemic drop that caused it to drop 75% I would say it gives you insight into what could happen if a recession occurs right regardless of what triggers it whether it's a Black Swan or whether it's just a slow long progression of the yield curve and all that stuff if we ignore that let's just suppose we get a landing and there's no recession right which is a big assumption but let's just for a minute suppose that that's true even in that case even before the pandemic was a thing eth still dropped 68% from the highs when eth Bitcoin broke down so you have two examples of eth breaking down and really measured from this top here in September it actually dropped around 60% so you have two examples where when eth Bitcoin broke down as measured from the previous local top on ethusd eth dropped 60% if you actually take it from this top over here you can see it was closer to a 72% drop and this one remember was about a 75% drop so what do you notice when eth Bitcoin breaks down it has never been good for ethusd even when Bitcoin went up now in the second case over here Bitcoin actually went down right so so in this case Bitcoin went down in 2019 in 2016 Bitcoin went up so what does that show you it shows you that no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD Bitcoin dominance went up during those times and eth Bitcoin went down e Bitcoin went down and so the question is is what does that mean this time because so many people out there right and I I it's almost scary how how how many people are saying it right so many people out there are Shilling memes and and outright scams and they're being paid to do it and they do it over and over and over again and their followers follow them and they get wrecked and then they just keep on doing it because there's always some other 100x gem that they're going to recommend that they were paid to recommend okay now for a while people just assume it's okay and that nothing is nothing bad is happening but this is a major event that eth Bitcoin has fallen it's a major event and I think not enough people are are paying attention to it they're focused on other things they're focused on the the latest meme coin craze they're rationalizing why their altcoins are down 30 to 40% over the last couple of weeks this is a major event I know it's a meme guy I me get it I get it but if you look at the logarithmic regression trend line for eth fit to to non-bubble data you will see that after eth Bitcoin broke down here and here eusd went to the lower logarithmic regression trend line or home if you will that's what happened and I can't help but wonder why should this time be any different because as we saw over here eth USD dropped from the local high 72% over here even if you don't worry about the pandemic it still dropped about 66 67% if you include the recession 73 or 72% or so if you take this from here from 4K a 70% drop puts you exactly at the fair value logarithmic aggression trend line that's where it would put ethereum and I don't know why we should assume this time is any different one thing to consider is that you know I know a lot of people are talking about a left translated cycle and so as I've said before I'm not completely unsympathetic to that view I'm not but I don't for for me I still think if you want exposure to crypto I I think Bitcoin makes more sense than ethereum right now now that doesn't mean that Bitcoin can't collapse I think it probably will get a pretty big drop um at at some point especially as as the yield curve un inverts but I don't know exactly when that's going to be um we do know that last cycle Bitcoin topped out about a month before the First Rate cut I know the First Rate cut is getting priced further and further out but I think that the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in I've explained what I mean by that before I really want to spend a ton of time explaining that again so ethusd potentially is starting to turn the corner here and what's actually fascinating about ethusd when you look at it on its USD pair when it broke down against Bitcoin last time the pattern is almost identical we have this wedge that ethusd broke out of right we have this wedge ethusd broke out of it topped eth Bitcoin broke down right there eth USD then fell back through the wedge right it fell back through the wedge now look at it over here it's the same thing you have a wedge that ethusd was in for a long time and now eth Bitcoin has broken down ethusd is starting to correct and it looks like it's potentially going to correct right through the wedge just like it did over here which by the way occurred as those rate Cuts finally arrived so I don't really care what the CME Market tool thing is is showing for when rate cuts are going to occur I look at this and say if this keeps on dropping like this it represents a consumer that is starting to falter and therefore it will likely not take until November or September for a rate cut I could see a rate cut coming this Summer Okay so this pattern to me looks like it's playing out once again I have said forever that after eth Bitcoin breaks down we will likely see ethusd fall back through this wedge to me it looks like it is finally happening so I think that it makes a lot of sense to view the market view ethusd through the lens of eth Bitcoin and the reason for that is over the last two and a half years if you wanted exposure to crypto then you have to figure out what you're going to buy and of course if you're if you're a full Deen and you're you're buying micro cap stuff you're probably not really interested in what I have to say anyways but if you're not as risky if you don't want to take on as much risk um if you're dealing with say a significant amount of money um a large percentage of your of your funds are going into high you know some of these risky assets and you don't want to speculate too much out of the top you know top cup two or three maybe the top 10 then understanding these patterns are I think very important to navigate the cryptoverse in a successful way and so over the last two and a half years if you wanted exposure to crypto and you decided what do you want to buy do you want to buy Bitcoin or eth my view for the last two and a half years is that Bitcoin is the better play because it will likely hit new all-time highs first which it did it will likely not be subject to as much regulation risk as ethereum and also guess what during quantitative tightening e Bitcoin bleeds and it's as simple as that and you know I've seen all sorts of narratives out there that are saying that well proof of stake has failed or that you know there's all these other things there's no evidence of that yet actually there really isn't this is all just monetary policy stuff there's no evidence of any of that yet I think Bitcoin has stood the test of time well and I hope that ethereum does but everything that you've seen happen since November 202 1 is an artifact of monetary policy nothing more so it might lead people to believe that proof of stake is failing when in reality it's just an artifact of tighter monetary policy which is exactly what we saw last cycle in fact during quantitative tightening last cycle we saw the eth Bitcoin valuation bleed in fact if you were to Overlay Bitcoin USD onto this chart you will find that we had a bull market in 2019 and during that bull market Bitcoin did not put in a new high but eth Bitcoin went down because the Fed was still doing quantitative tightening what marked the bottom for eth Bitcoin what marked the bottom it was precisely when the fed pivoted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing that was the bottom it wasn't any more complicated than that it wasn't the narratives that you could have come up with back then it had nothing to do with what some YouTuber was saying about whether it was going to just go to zero or something all it had to do was was was the FED printing money or not was the FED reducing the size of the balance sheet or were they increasing the size of the balance sheet that's what it came down to and once again everyone's trying to over complicate it and come up with a thous different narratives for why it's happening and I said a long time ago that this was what's going to happen when it breaks down people will find a reason and of course the reason that people are looking at is regulation risk which is what we said a long time ago some of the reg regulation news that we've seen recently and also the potential rejection of the spot ETF for ethereum none of that stuff matters none of it matters ethereum has been fine without a spot ETF forever it's not going to die if it if it's rejected I think ethereum's valuation against the US dollar is going down but not because of the spot ETF eth went to $4,800 without a spot ETF I think eth USD is going to go down because eth Bitcoin has broken support it is broken below the June 2022 low and that is the important thing to consider you know if you if you don't follow it too closely we can look very closely at it here the low in June of 2022 for eth Bitcoin was 0.409 so if you draw a line across the page at 0409 so we're going to get a line here 040 well let me get it exact right here there you have it 0049 that was the low and what I said was that we will get a weekly close below the range low and when we do that is when ethereum finally starts to go down on its USD valuation and you can see eth Bitcoin is capitulating below the range low ethusd is starting to capitulate as well last cycle the first month that ethusd fell after e Bitcoin topped a 25% drop by the monthly close a 25% drop by the monthly close for eth this time would put it at around 2700 give or take a 100 or so you know because I didn't really get that accurate there about 27 let's just say 27 2800 something like that 26 2800 because it's not going to be exact anyways just because it was 25 here doesn't mean it has to be 25 here but then where it became brutal was while a lot of people assumed that it would be a buy the dip opportunity the following month after eth Bitcoin broke down it dropped another 21% right so imagine if ethusd first drops that 25% to get it down to 2700 and then drops another 21% from there where does that put e coincidentally it puts it at $2,000 right at 2K and what you'll notice is after it had this drop it then tried to hold that as support for a little while right and that support level that it tried to hold was also the the resistance level back over here it was the resistance level this resistance level was 2K right so my guess is that this summer and probably as maybe even as soon as May in fact May or June I think we will see there's a there's a high likelihood we will see eth at 2K if I'm wrong it's because Bitcoin is getting some type of left translated cycle and it's just dragging eth up with it right and in that case case while technically I would be wrong about about ethusd you would still be better off with Bitcoin than ethereum okay I wish I had known this stuff in Prior Cycles it's not like anyone told me I learned the hard way and I was hoping to help other people not go through that and that's why I've been talking about the Bitcoin dominance forever and all Bitcoin pairs forever so 2K is the level that I think eth is going to correct down to after the Bitcoin having from there it will probably try to hold it as support is my guess but I also think that it will fail to hold it as support and I do think it will eventually go to the lower logarithmic regression trend line if you look at a lot of these bottoming processes for ethereum what you'll notice notice is that it doesn't just tend to put in one low and then never revisit it right you can see over here it put in a low and then it got pretty close to testing it a while later if you just look at monthly closes you can see that these monthly closes we eventually Wicked below the monthly closes you can see over here these monthly closes we eventually went below them right so once again I think eth will eventually go back below these levels and and go back to the lower logarithmic regression trend line especially now that eth Bitcoin has fallen so just as everyone is getting hyped up for the Bitcoin having and and all the things that come with it what happens if this plays out and instead of getting a left translated Peak like everyone's talking about what happens if we just bleed after it for 6 months and we just see ethusd go back to the lower logarithmic aggression trend line we had a we had a 9month bare Market over here after eth Bitcoin broke down if you ignore the pandemic we had a six-month bare market after eth Bitcoin broke down why can't that happen again Bitcoin when Bitcoin sneezes the rest of the market gets extremely sick take a look at where Bitcoin is this cycle okay as measured Peak to Peak as measured Peak to Peak you can see how far ahead of schedule we are I mean we are so far ahead of schedule right now Bitcoin has never been this heat of going into the having it's always been the last two cycles Bitcoin was 60% below its high when we went into the having if Bitcoin falls back into line with the last couple of Cycles what happens to eth you know I mean you can see that eth Bitcoin is going down right so if Bitcoin USD goes back to where it was previously let's say Bitcoin goes back to where it was just say like I don't know half a year ago but instead of eth Bitcoin being up here it's all the way down here then ethusd gets hit a lot harder right that's the reason why the Bitcoin valuations are important if you take the inverse of one over if you take the inverse of e Bitcoin so you're looking at the Bitcoin eth valuation what do you notice over here one Bitcoin would have gotten you about 11 to 12 eth now it gets you 20 eth I think it's going to go out pretty high here and potentially get you know 32 E when it's all said and done now when you look at eth Bitcoin there's a case to be made that it's either on a logarithmic regression path or it's an oscillator okay so the logarithmic regression path would be viewed like this something like that meaning even if you're a long-term Bull on the eth Bitcoin valuation which I've said many many times like I can understand why you might be I mean these are technically higher lows but even if you are it's still likely is going to go down to the 03 to 04 range before you figure out if the higher lows are important or if the lower Highs are more important because everyone on X whenever I post anything about the eth Bitcoin valuation they will tell me well you're ignoring the higher low I'm not ignoring anything you know I've pointed them out a million times but the reality is that you have higher lows here but eth Bitcoin has also not seen a new high since 2017 that's a long time you know imagine if like Bitcoin hadn't seen a new all-time high since 2017 you know how people give uh the gold bugs a hard time because gold took like 10 years to put on a new all-time high I mean who are you talking to if you're an eth maxi you have no room to stand really here because it's been bleeding against Bitcoin since 2017 yes eusd has gone to new Highs but so what you still you know it still was lower highs against Bitcoin sure as measured from the bottom e outperforms Bitcoin in a QE bull market how many people have said over the last two and a half years that you know just you wait e outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market it outperforms Bitcoin in a QE bull market but in a qt bull market e Bitcoin gets annihilated in fact if you look at quarterly returns for eth Bitcoin the last if you include this quarter which is just started the last six quarters have been red you know that's not the definition of holding up well that's the definition of a slow and painful bleed where retail investors keep capitulating because they they're changing their mind about it and I think that eth Bitcoin has entered into the final capitulation phase so I don't know exactly how long it's going to take to find a bottom I can tell you that the last couple of times it took about two to three months okay so here you can see we broke down in like October it bottomed out about two months later here it broke down in Ju July it bottomed out about 2 months later about 8 weeks in fact so there is a case to be made that it could bottom in June right there's a case to be made that it could um again it's probably going to be dependent on when the FED pivots If the Fed doesn't pivot until later then it could take longer for it to bottom in fact while it did bottom in June it still or sorry over here while it bottomed in August and then basically put in a double bottom in December now a lot of people will say that I've seen on on X when I post about this they'll say oh so you're just telling me in two more months eth is you know they'll say that they'll their interpretation of me saying that eth Bitcoin might find a bottom this summer their interpretation of that is to then immediately assume that that means eth is going to Skyrocket following that the reality is that even after eth Bitcoin bottomed in August of 2019 eth us D even after eth Bitcoin bottomed ethusd still dropped 47% after that and if you ignore the pandemic it dropped about 30% okay that is going to be the next phase of the market cycle which I think is going to be a difficult phase because do you know how over the last two and a half years I've said that that eth Bitcoin will go down no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD the next phase of the cycle as we get into rate cuts is especially when the FED pivots from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing and E Bitcoin finally finds a bottom probably between 03 to 04 the next phase is me saying that eth Bitcoin goes up no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD the reason why that's going to be challenging is because a lot of people are going to assume that if eth Bitcoin is going up they're going to assume that ethusd is going up but in reality that's not what happened last cycle eth Bitcoin started to go up and put in higher lows and I mean this was a higher low here but ethusd was still going down that's why the last year has been frustrating because Bitcoin dominance has gone up and I said many times that e Bitcoin will bleed no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD and it has but ethusd has gone up so people feel like they missed out my only point was if you want crypto bitcoin's better play than eth so yes maybe you feel like you missed out on eth you still just would have been better off with Bitcoin so you didn't really miss out on anything in fact if you were to go look at a DCA strategy if you had bought Bitcoin $100 of it even since the beginning of 2022 through today you're currently up about 125% had you done the same thing for ethereum you're only up 68% right and if you actually take it from say November of 2022 right if we actually take it from the the the capitulation region or whatever you can see that with eth you'd be up about 69% but with Bitcoin you'd be up 120% so this is why I mean I've learned my lesson you know I've tried really hard to sort of preach the the the talk about Bitcoin dominance and all Bitcoin Pairs and and thinking that I could get to through to some people and I think I have reached some people but I can assure you the next cycle this will not be my goal okay it will not be my goal anymore because I've learned the hard way that people do not care about Bitcoin valuations for the most part they mostly focus on USD valuations and they don't see that eth Bitcoin has dropped 40% from the highs all they care about or 45% from the highs all they care about is the fact that it's gone up recently but I think people are about to find out why the Bitcoin valuation matters it's been fun in games up until this point but eth Bitcoin had not broken support it has broken support now the last two times this happened ethusd had a considerable drop and it lasted for at least a few months over here and then the last cycle it lasted for about half a year so please understand that this is not you know do you think I I mean look guys I really enjoyed talking about e Bitcoin back over here when I was bullish on it in 2019 I really enjoyed it and and everyone liked you know everyone liked me and then I became the bad guy in you know in in 2022 when I pointed out the fact that eth Bitcoin was in a distribution phase and it was very hard for me mentally because I had a lot of friends back then in the ethereum community that essentially turned their back on me and and started you know they they were once people that I communicated with in a good way and in a positive way and because I Chang my view they you know essentially completely changed their opinion about me and it's been very hard dealing with that um and and you know even this video over here I talked about the coming collapse you know talking about it coming back down here and and and continuing to to sort of break down um you know looking at at these various Trends and I you know Market the market is a difficult thing you know because if you're bullish on something and I mean this is maybe some advice for for any of you guys that search your own YouTube channel um it's hard because I I I feel like as as and this is maybe just some Reflections but think as a as a influencer for back lack of better word in the crypto space naturally you're going to be if you're making videos about something you're going to be bullish on it more for for a lot of people right if you're going to start a YouTube channel on an asset class it's not like you're going to start it just to say you know say bad things about it right when you start it you're naturally bullish on it right I started mine in mid 2019 I was bullish on eth bitcoin I saw the opportunity there but as an influencer you either stop making videos as the hero or you do it long enough to become the villain and it's not a fun place to be um it's really not and I I'm I'm happy that this process is is likely almost over but I still think it needs at least a couple more months okay June at the earliest is my guess that eth Bitcoin bottoms out June at the earliest about mid June could be when it finally bottoms out which would be interesting because that's when it bottomed out in 2022 in fact so if you look at it from that perspective what if it just bottoms eight weeks after breaking support just like it did here and just like it did here and if it bottoms eight weeks later after breaking support that puts the bottom in mid June basically maybe early June early let me get this exact because I don't I don't want to tell you guys something this wrong um from the low so we broke it last week so eight weeks later would be the week of June 3 right so I mean if it if it happened by the end of the week right it would be you know June 10th right June 9th June 10th so I could see a compelling case for it essentially bottoming out as early as June but it's also going to be dependent on monetary policy right if we get to June and the FED is still not cutting rates and and they're still not going from quantitative easing to quantitative or quantitative tightening to quantitative easing then it might go on longer and you know it's very possible we just go into a recession um but I I do think my base case at this point in time is that eth Bitcoin bottoms this summer ethusd bleeds a little bit longer and then at some point later this year or early next year the FED will will turn the money printer back on and then you will see a bull you know a a bull phase for the E Bitcoin valuation but I don't think we're there yet I don't and you know this is a long process you can't really rush it we can come up you know everyone's had a thousand different narratives for the last two and a half years as to why I was wrong on the eth Bitcoin valuation the deflationary aspect of it the tokenomics right all the merge proof of stake all these things they said I'm not considering the spot ETF right even after the spot ETF for Bitcoin was launched what happened eth Bitcoin got a pretty big pump and do you guys realize how many people dunked on me then where are they now right because it just keeps on bleeding and now I'm seeing the same thing now people are saying well after the having you know e Bitcoin will will show you what's up but I I don't think so I think it's going to keep on bleeding for the next couple of months maybe bottoming out by mid June at the earliest maybe early to mid June um potentially later depending on on what the FED does those are my views it's been hard expressing them for a while but to be completely honest I I don't apologize for them um this is the entire reason I I mean I I just wanted to help right I just wanted to help the Bitcoin dominant stuff I know it's made me a ton of enemies but I I was just trying to help and and now it's you know it's a it's it's broken out right it really has broken out and I think it's about to go to 60% that's where I think it's going 60% so it can't get to 60% easily if eth Bitcoin doesn't drop and I I do think that eth Bitcoin is going to drop to the 03 to 0.04 range and the reason why you should heed this warning if you don't hold ethereum is because the altcoin market gets wrecked even worse okay so if you look at altcoins from last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down the altcoin market got destroyed frankly um you know if you were to look at at total three and I know everyone's just saying this is a is a dip buying opportunity but I'm I'm over here thinking that this is this right this is when you know this was just before the FED pivoted what if this is the same thing and everyone's just buying the dip on alt as they just slowly bleed back down for the next several months so when eth Bitcoin collapsed last cycle all USD valuations fell 72% so I guess it was actually about the same um as as as eth us so about 72% so 72% drop would actually put alt at a new low can that happen maybe I often come back to this idea that everyone you know that no one's going to like but if their Bitcoin valuation can put in new lows right like if A's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if Dot's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if litecoin's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if maddox's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if all of these different altcoins can put in new lows on their Bitcoin valuations then they can put new lows on their USD valuations too I didn't want to believe it last cycle I really didn't and and that's what happened they put in new lows a lot of them put in new lows so I think that is is is something that is worthwhile to think about you know and I I know I I know these I I hate putting these videos out frankly because then I'm just inundated with with um you know with with people who who troll me back but I don't want to I don't want to say things that don't believe and I learned the lesson the hard way the last cycle and the reality of the situation right the reality the altcoin Reckoning was was always based on their Bitcoin valuations I said that in basically every altcoin Reckoning video the altcoin Reckoning re refers to the devaluation of alt Bitcoin pairs alt Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows what does that mean it means the altcoin Reckoning never ended that's what it means that's my interpretation of it so those are my thoughts about ethereum I've tried to you know to be diplomatic about the US Dev evaluation um in terms of hey it's going to go up if Bitcoin goes up but with eth Bitcoin breaking down I I do feel some very strong conviction that it is is time it is time for ethereum to make the Journey Back to the lower regression band admittedly it has taken a lot longer than I thought I'm not going to pretend like I predicted this perfectly because I haven't and I've been wrong about many many things but the last two cycles that e Bitcoin broke down that is when eth went to the lower logarithmic progression trend line and I just I don't think this time is going to be any different if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe crypt.of this either way um but as we you know as we do get further into the cycle um you know I know a lot of you guys are are wanting me to talk a lot more about altcoins especially as they bought them out against Bitcoin but frankly I don't know I mean I I do want to talk about at least the larger you know the the Bitcoin and ethereum I will talk about those but there's so much there's just so much garbage being shilled everywhere right now that that that people are being paid to do it and it's just it's such a you know such such a disheartening thing honestly like I will get people asking me to uh shill a a micro cap you know a meme coin and they'll offer you know money to do so and I will say no and I will ignore them and I I honestly just typically block them because I I don't really want to talk to those people and then a few days later I will see people on on X Shilling that coin and and I know and they pretend like they just think it's a good coin when in reality I know that they're being paid to do it and they're not disclosing it and then their followers are following them and then they're selling those those they they they were given these allocations in these projects and they're selling those coins to their followers as they promote them and those people get all the accolades because that's what people want they want the 100x gems they want to gamble right but that usually doesn't work right get rich quick schemes really don't work and um you really have to be careful and you know the issue that I found is that so many people in crypto they just they they they forget about it right they'll they'll fall for the scams and then and then they'll get mad at those people that Shield them and then six months later they'll forget about it and fall for the same thing over again so I I really do hope that people stop doing it I hope that people stop following the people that do it because it it makes a joke of the entire industry and I I think that if we're ever going to grow as an industry we really have to get past all the meme coin stuff I'm not saying that you can't have some form of of the Mee coin there's always going to be something there but guys I mean there's like thousands of them right now and and that's why you're seeing Bitcoin dominance go up everyone who was bullish on altcoins this year for the most part told me that Bitcoin dominance had topped so yes some of the altcoins went up on their USD valuations but not because the reasons they thought right Bitcoin went up more um and now if Bitcoin does cool off after the having then then they find out why their altcoins went up and it wasn't because there was anything fundamentally great about it it was just because Bitcoin went up and people were chasing the next great thing but just be careful uh be careful with all those accounts that are are shilling that garbage um out there I want to be clear I don't think ethereum Falls in that category I think ethereum is a legitimate project and my views on its Bitcoin valuation are not a reflection on my fundamental views of ethereum they're just a reflection on monetary policy and that's what makes it so difficult is because you know being bearish on eth bitcoin makes a lot of people assume I'm antie when in reality the very first videos on my channel were bullish on the eth Bitcoin valuation so I've learned a lot I mean as you know just as as a person making content in the crypto space um over the last couple years I'm not really sure if I want to go through that process again next cycle but um that's where we stand we'll see if this if it plays out kind of like it did the last couple of Cycles if I'm wrong which there's a chance I've been wrong about plenty of things I do think that if I am wrong about eusd going back down there it must be because we're getting some type of left translated cycle that's not my base case I my base case is not for a translated cycle it's not um I just think that if we do go uh if it doesn't follow this path then I I think it must be because of a left translated cycle any we'll go and wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2m8ou_0oB0\\n\\nHi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing Wikipedia page views if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse docomo that will hopefully help you navigate the crypto verse just a bit better one interesting thing is that we can track social interest I mean we we've done videos on the social risk before but we can track social interest quite easily by looking at you know views to to to YouTube channels and and new followers on Twitter to people that talk about cryptocurrency this is just simply looking at new Wikipedia page views to the to the Bitcoin page and what what's fascinating is that you can see that during the 2017 Peak it spiked quite high and in fact it went a lot higher in 2017 than it did over here in 2021 now there is an explanation for that I think and that is that as crypto has grown as an asset class there's obviously a lot of other cryptocurrencies as well and so while we did not get a spike on the search term or the Wikipedia page for Bitcoin in 2021 if you were to go look at cryptocurrency you can see that there was a very similar spike in 2021 around that first Peak just like there was in 2017 and in fact if you look even recently we've seen it slowly trending back up it looks like it found um at least for the the search the page of cryptocurrency you can see that it found some these lows back in April and it has been trending higher although at least in recent days it's starting to go back down now that the spot ETF stuff is behind us of course with the with the having around the corner we could still see that interest come right back but it might be interesting to Overlay all of them right so now what we're looking at is the sum of you know these pages that look at not only Bitcoin page and the cryptocurrency page but also ethereum as well as many others and when you do that you get a chart that looks like this which is interesting from the perspective of major Peak here on Wikipedia page views in 2017 very similar thing in 2021 but there hasn't really been a whole lot of interest for a while right I mean now price has gone up the price of Bitcoin has gone up but there's not a lot of people searching for cryptocurrency right now so the social interest Still Remains relatively relatively low it's like when we talk about the social risk and you know what is it going to take to get people interested right what is it going to take retail participants interested in crypto again that are not already here you might say well hey I'm interested but there's a difference between say someone that stuck around for all of 2022 and all of 2023 and they're just still here right there's a difference between that type of person and the person that only joined in the first peak of 2021 lost all their money in the summer crash and then just left right and you can see I mean it's it's pretty clear that those people have not returned right you can see that they have not in terms of in terms of search interest and of course this is also seen in in YouTube views and and and throughout various metrics but I think it's an interesting way to look at the cryptoverse to just get an idea of of of where we are in terms of the social sentiment in the space and you know is it trending up is it trending down or is it relatively sideways I think you could argue that uh it was trending down in 2022 or late 2021 trending down throughout most of 2022 but it seems like it's it's been relatively flat um you know for about a year now I mean it it did get some spikes over here going into the spot ETF stuff but it is still it has still been relatively flat a couple of things to note is that this Spike over over here in 2021 of course occurred after the having and it it occurred during loose monetary policy same thing over here this Spike occurred in 2017 it occurred after the having and it occurred during loose monetary policy so perhaps one of the reasons we haven't seen a you know a a similar type of spike is because we are before the having and we have also not seen the shift to looser monetary policy so perhaps those are the two ingredients that you need and it could be sort of representative of the idea that price is not the only thing that brings brings people back I mean Bitcoin has gone up what 3x from the from the from the 2022 lows and and still the search interest for all these cryptocurrencies Still Remains relatively flat so to me it implies that there's something more to it and and that you need you know you need looser monetary policy which conveniently also often corresponds to the having which Maybe by chance maybe by maybe not also happens to be an election year right we talk about like that cyclical behavior of of crypto and and you can kind of see it pretty clearly on this chart that you you get that interest at least in terms of Wikipedia page views to these assets after the having but it also tends to correspond to lose to monetary policy and even in 2019 you can see there was all sorts of positive price action where Bitcoin actually went up more in 2019 than it has throughout this entire rally over here because back over here it went up more than 3x from the lows and you can see that interest still didn't really come back until the very end of the having year right in the early part of the post having year and even over here you can see that while Bitcoin was going up for a while even in the having year it didn't really start to go up until halfway through the post having year so just interesting you know some interesting ways to look at the market hopefully this has been you know insightful uh to you guys to be the market like this again if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and again

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUWpziOMk-4\\n\\nHi, today we're going to talk about market cap hypotheticals for various cryptocurrencies if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse tocom I do mention into the cryptoverse decom into the cryptoverse premium quite a bit uh but I do want you to be aware that there is a free tier in fact and on that free tier is the DCA simulation tool um and we've also recently added this tool so if you like what you see in the video and you would like to explore what I'm doing but for say um an asset that you hold then you can do that okay you can do that and it and it doesn't cost anything you can just go to the website and sign up I think having some tools available for free uh is is great because it can help people better understand market dynamics it can better understand help people understand you know various strategies that they should they should focus on now this is bit a bit more of of of a fun video someone someone suggested yesterday that I should make some more fun videos occasionally um and I I understand that my my content can get pretty repetitive I know the Bitcoin dominance views are repetitive like you know Bitcoin will basically chop up chop up the altcoin market until the dominance is is much higher and unfortunately I can't speed things along right like those are my views and I don't think those views are going to change until we're on the other side of of rate cuts which probably are going to come within the next few months so at least we have that to look forward to which is nice but in the meantime I I wanted to at least show this chart basically what it is is it's just saying if this cryptocurrency had the market cap of another cryptocurrency what would the price be right what would the price be I think a lot of people have thought about that before you know like if if altcoin a had the market cap of altcoin B then where would the price be and so what this video allows you to do or sorry not what the chart allows you to do is it allows you to select an asset right and going through the first several hundred right maybe a couple hundred almost couple hundred cryptocurrencies now I don't know 99.9 I mean I don't I probably don't even know what like 95% of those cryptocurrencies are or even do that's just where they're located by market cap so the default asset is Bitcoin but this one might not it might not make the most sense to spend a lot of time looking at because if you're daydreaming about Bitcoin going to you know to a higher price then you're probably not looking at it compared to other assets because it's number one by market cap okay but it does show you like if Bitcoin had the market cap of other cryptocurrencies where would the price be so like if Bitcoin had the market cap of eth then the price of Bitcoin would be at like 14k but I don't really think a lot of people are are interested in that aspect of this chart you could go to ethereum and see what would the price of ethereum be if it had the market cap of Bitcoin and the hypothetical price would be 6.83k now one thing I will remind you is that even if ethereum ever went to the market cap of Bitcoin today which I think it probably would eventually note that bitcoin's market cap would likely be higher if ethereum's market cap is where Bitcoin is today I don't believe that ethereum is going to flip Bitcoin at least not in the in the near future right I know a lot of people are are very um Pro that but you you think about ethereum it it has been putting in higher lows against Bitcoin since you know basically since it's been around macro higher lows when you think about it but this also been putting in lower highs since 2017 and so if it were to ever do something like that which I'm really skeptical of but if it were then I I I I would imagine it would be you know many many years away for something like that to happen so if a the were ever at the market cap of Bitcoin in my mind it would imply that bitcoin's market cap is actually quite a bit larger but I I think where this gets more interesting is if you go down the list right and and you you really go down the list and look at various cryptocurrencies and and kind of see where they fit in for instance like if we were to go down to say salana it'll show you where you know I mean it'll show you basically what the price would be if it had the market cap of various assets so essentially it shows you the latest price and so you know if salana had the market cap of xrp then the price of salana would be $65 therefore it implies that the market cap of salana is greater than xrp if salana had the market cap of BNB then it would be $107 if I had the market cap of Ethan it' be $631 if it had the market cap of madic it would be $16 if you were to look at xrp right you can go through the same type of exercise um cardano right same type of exercise like if it if Ada had the market cap of of avalanche then it'd be at 34 cents but if it had the market cap of xrp then it would be at 81 cents so we know that ADA then comes right in between here xrp and Avalanche and again I mean you can you can go all the way up the list right like if a had the market cap of salana then it'd be a buck 15 if it had the market cap of B&B than it' be 133 just to provide maybe one more example a couple more examples maybe Avalanche right like so if Avalanche had the had the market cap of ADA then it would put it at $46 if it had the market cap of B&B then it' put it at $126 if it had the market cap of Litecoin then it'd put it all the way down at $13 so I think a lot of us get so focused on on sort of the price and and what is price doing um but it's important to remember that like when you put out a price prediction if your price prediction for that asset is much higher than bitcoin's current you know if if the price suggests a market cap of that cryptocurrency that is orders of you know that's multiples above bitcoin's current market cap then it's likely not going to happen right it's like back in early 2021 when a lot of people were were calling for you know cardano for Ada to go to $50 and it's like guys like that's that's not going to happen that would imply it going to higher much higher than bitcoin's market cap and you know it's like I I know that you guys are bullish but I mean you also have to be grounded in your expectations you know there's there's all sorts of predictions out there that they sort of come out to play even even Bitcoin you know there were all sorts of predictions of calling for 300K back in the last cycle I'm sure a lot of people remember all those 300K predictions that were you know everywhere in early 2021 and then what happened right what happened to all those predictions they were wrong and Bitcoin didn't even go anywhere near 300K and the reason that you know I suspected that it wouldn't go there was because of the idea of diminishing returns right from one cycle to another to go to 300K that cycle would have implied that it had the same Roi in the last cycle as it did the cycle before and that hasn't happened before not saying it can't ever happen but that was the reasoning behind thinking it wouldn't go to 300K was because it would imply the returns for two cycles in a row would be the same that doesn't really make sense when the market cap was so much higher and we know it just takes you know exponen exponentially more money to move the asset if you look at at at polka dot you know the the current price of polka dot is is 670 if it had the market cap of of ADA then the market cap would be about $13 so I mean it shows you that A's market cap is about twice that of polka dots and it shows you you know which which assets have been stronger over the last few years right like if it had the market cap of xrp it'd be $21 if it had the market cap of BNB it'd be $35 if it had the market cap of ethereum it'd be $26 right it shows you where the where the price would be if it had the market cap of this other cryptocurrency so when you think about about things like price and like if something looks cheaper to you just because it's like a smaller value it's more important to look at at the market cap right like it doesn't make sense to go say Hey you know you know this cryptocurrency has a lower price than another cryptocurrency therefore it's going to catch up no I mean you should look at market cap now I know a lot of people will go out and say well you know there's going to be some people that will buy the asset just because it it has a lower price but I mean while there may be some elements of that that are true I I I still think in the end market cap is much more important and market cap will give us a better guide as to as to whether that is theoretically possible now remember it also depends on where bitcoin's market cap is so if you're at a position where you think that Bitcoin has topped out right let's say at some point you think all right Bitcoin is topped out and and my altcoin is going to run for a few weeks before everything comes you know crumbling back down right like let's imagine this scenario in the future if bitcoin's market cap is at a certain level and you don't think it's going to go any higher but you think your altcoin is going to go to a price that would mean 5x of bitcoin's current market cap then you know that's an outrageous prediction right and you know that if you hold out for such a price you will likely end up holding those bags for a long time and then hoping that the altcoin eventually returns to to new alltime highs most of the time a lot of altcoins don't there are some altcoins that do I know a lot of altcoins have had sizable rallies over the last few months and congratulations to those who have who have made gains on them but how many of them have put in new highs how many of them are anywhere remotely close to their prior highs right I mean bitcoin's kind of close um all things considered like it's not I mean it's in the' 40s and the high was at 69k but a lot of altcoins are still down you know 60% or more and unfortunately a lot of altcoins will they'll stay like that right there will be some that that likely reclaim their their all-time highs and there will likely be a lot of new altcoins that end up being the focus of of you know of of future Cycles but this is one tool that I think can be helpful for people um to navigate the market right and and and maybe just to provide a couple more examples uh here's chain link so if chain link had the market cap of ADA then chain Link's market cap or chain Link's price would be at $30 if it had the market cap of of salana then it would be at $71 and if Cosmos if Adam had the market cap of avalanche it would put it at $31 if it had the market cap of salana it would put it $15 if it had the market cap of Litecoin it would put it at $13 so this is a tool that just lets your imagination run for a little bit right to think about like what is possible right you know if you think about like an altcoin and and you're you know you're you're comparing it let's say it's like number 15 or 16 by market cap and you want to know is it possible for this you know for this asset to go to this price maybe just go look at some of the other altcoins that you think are you know relevant competition and if those assets have market caps that correspond to that price you're wanting then maybe it's possible but if the market cap of that that corresponding price corresponds to you know to bitcoin's market cap right then it's not it's likely not happening because as as much as you want your altcoin to be a competitor to bitcoin it's not it's just not and the truth is it likely never will be that's just the way the market works you know Bitcoin has been number one the entire time and yeah I mean I get people are going to say well you know what if it's the you know sort of the the AOL of the internet right like what if it's it's like the the Myspace of of social media I mean you can make those comparisons if you want to but I don't think this falls into that into that comparison a lot of those other things only were at the top for a few years I mean Bitcoin has been at the top since 2009 I mean you're you're talking about 15 years right at what point at what point do we just say hey it's it's it's unlikely that your altcoin is going to flip Bitcoin right and and again like it that seems like the the the the most logical conclusion to come to right like it's unlikely that's going to happen therefore if you're daydreaming about a price that you want your altcoin to go to look at bitcoin's market cap and say hey if bitcoin's market cap is there then probably not going to make it there right and in reality you know it probably won't even make it to you know to half of bitcoin's market cap right you know some have gotten close at various points um especially ethereum but um that's sort of the reality of of the situation is that you know most of them aren't going to go to like 80 90% of bitcoin's market cap even that and and they'd be lucky to get to 50% right I mean ethereum has has reached that Milestone and I think a few other altcoins have various points as well but it's just something to keep in mind so again this tool it's free right it's free and you can access it via into the Crypt premium link is in the description below just sign up for the free tier you just have to provide your email and then you can daydream about all the different cryptocurrencies you want to and what the price of those assets would be if they had the market cap of another cryptocurrency if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and I'll see you guys next time bye\"},\n",
