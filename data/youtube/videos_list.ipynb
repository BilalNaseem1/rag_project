       "\"Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all [Music] day hello Joe how are you my friend I'm great man I'm psyched to be here cheers sir cheers brother har Krishna har Krishna great to see you always that's good my friend it's a strange times and uh we're both departing this land I know for greener Fosters I keep thinking back to when we first became friends in the strange path since from there to here and all our predictions and all the things that we we never would have imagined this you know specifically like that there would be this [\\xa0__\\xa0] Global pandemic that we would suddenly be like some kind of like Refugee is way too dramatic a word for it but suddenly just part of this diaspora of comedians pouring out of La like and not just comedians but just people leave leaving man well um I talked to Joey today from New Jersey called you know I called him he's in New Jersey and it was just such so strange I'm like you're in Jersey he's like that's right [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah you know he's he's all happy in Jersey you know he was the last like you leaving was intense but I was still like you know maybe we'll stick around and see what happens and then like I'd been getting all these you know the problem with me is like I get weird Vibes all the time and like the last I was on here I legitimately thought a meteor was going to hit the earth I I really thought that so I I work very hard on not listening to that part of me most of the time but I was getting this real weird vibe from LA and I'm like come on man you're just like superstitious it's it's probably nothing and then then my wife would say like I'm getting a really weird vibe like we maybe maybe I don't know if we should stay here renting if we stay in the place and I didn't want to tell her oh I've been getting a weird vibe too cuz I didn't want to amplify whatever that was and then I got on the phone with Diaz and he's like yeah I'm leaving getting the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of here and that was it Diaz was telling me Burbank was sketchy where he lives in Burbank CU my neighborhood turned the [\\xa0__\\xa0] like instantly dude it's like yeah it's it's it's not and it's not just any one thing you know it's like not just like some of the stuff I get stuff had to get shut down and because stuff was shut down it got a little more weathered than usual and it's like the you know the homeless encampments I was an Echo Park man and like I really feel like you know like the red State people one of the things they love to tweet is like don't bring your liberal [\\xa0__\\xa0] here right and right well this that's where I'm eating [\\xa0__\\xa0] a little bit because you know I am I do still believe that we need to uh decriminalize drugs that the the drug policy's [\\xa0__\\xa0] the way we're handling it's all wrong but they there used to be a way that they could get people who are like camping out on the streets and a lot of the times that was possession of like illegal drugs and because that that stuff got removed uh suddenly you were witnessing like holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] man there's people who are making like real like ra a rational decision from the perspective of a heroin addict which is they love heroin so much you know that Doug Stan hope joke some things are better than life like they love heroin so much they're addicted to it they love it and the shelters that are apparently available won't let them do drugs in the shelters they want you to kick it yeah and so that's ridiculous but now I could be wrong about that but that is what I've heard as one of the reasons these people are staying out in the street is not cuz they don't want to be in a shelter it's because they don't want to be prevented from getting hot and so this has produced this like situation in a lot of the big cities which is we're seeing like massive tent cities and by the way the Tent City thing aesthetically it's not uh it's not the best look but the stuff that I began to experienc in Echo Park man I took I I took my kid to the playground right and there's like a dude that looks like he emerged from a time portal from an apocalypse you know what I mean I'm not talking about like you know run-of-the-mill like somebody who's a junkie who's like I'm talking like covered in like soot like pure dilated eyes not wearing like you know the disheveled clothes you might expect from someone who's been addicted to heroin for a long time but like wearing like like he broke into wherever the costumes from Mad Max were like some kind of weird leather vest thing and like like creepy [\\xa0__\\xa0] cut off shorts and he had a a machete oh Jesus and he's throwing it into the ground of the playground and pulling it out like he's practicing throwing a machete I'm with my [\\xa0__\\xa0] toddler man and you know it's like and so obviously we didn't go to the playground but that was you know my you know it was not uncommon in that area to see completely naked people just not that that's bad but not naked like the way covered in dirt wandering aimlessly you do even worse than wandering aimlessly wandering with what seems to be a purpose in their eyes some of them seeming like they're late where the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are you going naked that you're laid for like are you being summoned like that was that was but that wasn't just it man you know it's a lot of other things too and it all just started piling on top of dude I don't think this is sustainable living in giant groups of people I think it's when it's when it works great it was wonderful when when La was was working well it was fantastic when The Comedy Store was packed and restaurants were doing well and the economy was doing well and the crime wasn't high it's great but when things go bad there's no sense of community so then there's a sense of like people capitalizing on other people who either own stores or who aren't home or whatever people who are Des there's to there's too many people yeah if you're in a community that's a small town and something goes wrong you can kind of bunch up together and help each other yeah cuz you feel like you need each other and you feel like you're you're a part of something people don't feel like they're a part of something here they're all transient everybody's moved here from someone else from somewhere else everybody thinks they can go somewhere else and they can and they probably will I mean I you know we all came from different you were North Carolina I came from uh New York at the time we all everybody who comes to LA in Show Business God what are the percentage of like how many do we know that are just straight la like Christina pizitz she's straight La who else um Sebastian came from Chicago Theo came from Nashville did Nashville is that he came from noou no Louisiana that's right I mean Joey obviously Jersey yeah well gywn which is something I've always loved about it I've loved that element of like just this wild vortex artist and narcissists and people who just Gane and like it's a lot of Sparks Fly in in that kind of insane cauldron of identity all that stuff is super cool it's it's beautiful that's one of the things I loved about is like the place we all know this is the place is a place where you make illusion that was the idea you make things that aren't real seem real and people like to watch that that's the whole TV movie industry the whole place is based on it cre creting an identity that you like somehow monetize or a studio makes monetizes your identity or something it was something magical and beautiful in all of that but not it seems like there's a real emperor where's no clo thing happening right now not just in LA and but I feel bad talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] about La cuz man she's been so good to both of us I this city is like I will always love this place it's not the problem is not the city this is the this I've been thinking about this a lot lately and here's an issue um I am Progressive on just about every issue across the board yeah uh gay rights civil rights women's rights whatever women's right to choose fill in the blank Pro Medicaid Pro Universal basic in um um Pro so many things but there's a thing that happens in large cities where large cities are always blue and I'm trying to figure this out cuz like New York is and I used to think it's oh it's because they're educated you know and educated people are more likely to be compassionate and compassionate people more likely to be Democrats but there's a balance that has to be achieved and when the [\\xa0__\\xa0] hits the fan you need Law and Order and I think that some people who are Democrats who are pro Progressive people they don't understand that aspect of human nature or they want to deny that aspect of human nature like when the mayor of Seattle was dealing with that whole six area lock down little small little country that they had put up barriers and [\\xa0__\\xa0] and and like literally were had armed guards there that uh what was it called again Chop Chop or Chaz right the the mayor said maybe this is our Summer of Love Like no it's not Summer of Love some people took over other people's businesses with Force like just because they think the way you think or they subscribe to Liberal ideas like you like you're a liberal too so the this is like your gang of thugs that you have to support when they take over other people's businesses no we have to be able to call out everybody and just because somebody is on your side you can't let them take over city blocks and just Institute their own government and then say it's the summer of love this is crazy talk and this is how this is gets get cities destroyed and this is what gets the police defunded and this what what gets people saying crazy things like we we need to disband release everyone from prison and no more prisons and no more laws and no more police and like no no the way things go well is you have to be safe the only way you're safe is if you have a strong military and a strong police force and there's something about liberals that don't want to believe that they see the bad cops they see these videos and we all agree we got to get rid of bad cops they got to reform the police they have to but those are not all the cops that's crazy you just only see the bad no one's no one's filming excellent interactions with friendly cops and compliant uh people that's not you're filming not going to get a lot of but that's the majority of these interactions but we have this distorted perception based on what we're exposed to which is viral videos of cops being [\\xa0__\\xa0] cuz there are cops that are [\\xa0__\\xa0] because there's people that are [\\xa0__\\xa0] and there's who knows how many [\\xa0__\\xa0] hundreds of thousands if not millions of cops there are the odds that they're not hundreds and thousands of [\\xa0__\\xa0] is is outrageous well you know what I've been doing with this whole [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing man uh because if I get because because you know me the way my mind goes is not going to be like red State Consciousness when it comes to that [\\xa0__\\xa0] cuz when I saw that autonomous Zone pop up I'm like let's do it baby spread it out come on but what did you think would be good what could good could have come of that well I mean the history of America is is is is this in beautiful yet somewhat like there's a there's a Mania a utopian Mania in the heart of I think the American Spirit which is like Americans identify with this it's you know and George Carin did a great job of desica it by saying it's called The American Dream because you got to be asleep to believe it I love that joke but I love the American dream and the what's so beautiful about it is it's this idea of like I think together we can do something new that's going to be better than anything that happened before and from that Spirit you get all great Innovation that goes across all political ideologies right so to me you know and they always call it I've always loved that they call it the American experiment [\\xa0__\\xa0] love that man cuz it's an experiment it's like let's see what we could do here together and for an experiment to work we need to be able to look at what didn't work in the experiment and improve upon it now that being said it's like for me I've been trying to like pull myself out of the even though I I identify as a progressive I'm going to vote Democrat I'm that's just what I'm going to do but that being said I try to pull myself out of that cuz I don't want to be cubby hold man and I have a lot of friends who are like hardcore conservatives and I know that there is this idea and I think a lot of the the idea gets perpetrated by people who are into tribalism blue red and so the the blue people they propagate a conceptualization of the red people which is kind of what you said that well they're not compassionate yeah it's like shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up ridiculous get the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of here these are some of the most compassionate people I've ever met in my [\\xa0__\\xa0] life they would die for people that they've never met they do you think a big problem is the figurehead right now the Republican party is Trump and Trump is such a polarized figure and he doesn't seem to have much empathy if if any seem you know I mean that's it's you don't know who he is really because you don't talk to him privately but his public Persona is that of a winner who doesn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] and you're fired I mean that's that's a non-empathetic perspective and we ass associate people who support him with also lacking empathy then you add into it children in cages at at the border and you see those videos you know what bothered me more than anything about the kids in cages there was one video that really bothered me where Mike Pence went to visit like he's on the ground like next to the cages see if you can find that Mike Pence visiting the the Border cages now apparently these cages had been put up through Obama and that's what's interesting about this whole border wall and Border discussion and immigration discussion cuz Obama particularly when he was running for president he was very tough on illegal immigration I mean he uh he said a lot of the same things that Trump said if you listen to the speeches that Obama said people believed him and agreed with him because it wasn't a republican talking point it was just a safety talking point and he was also a way that he could get people that were more like more concerned about the problem with illegal immigration or more you know he could he could tie that up with just saying listen we have to follow the rule of law and you know they they had the these talks and they built these these cages they did that during the Obama Administration right uh yeah see if you can so here here's this so sir these These are the guys that fled from Mexico and who knows where else and came through the Mexican border and then Pence is standing there in front of these guys so like imagine you're a dude you live in you know Ecuador and you make your way up through Mexico because you have a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dream like America is the land where people can make it this is this guy who fights in the UFC his name is Marlon Vera and uh he's a bad [\\xa0__\\xa0] and he just won this weekend and he's I believe he's from Ecuador right that's Marlon's yes and he um talked about it in his his victory speech he was talking about you know how hey man you know you can you can actually do it he came over here he was talking about in the countdown show too he came over here he lived a year without his family just building up money fighting to try to get money to bring his family over and then he brought his family over and then as time has gone on he keeps winning he's on like a seven fight win streak and now he's like a top 10 contender in the UFC and he could have been one of those dudes that's right see this this this is not these are just people that are in a [\\xa0__\\xa0] terrible place and they're trying to get out putting them in cages like it just it's a bad look and it's an even worse imagine you're that guy who comes over from Ecuador and you're in this cage and you see Pence he could touch him you could touch him if that cage was in there you could reach over and touch him on the shoulder right there the [\\xa0__\\xa0] guy who's second in line to the the the most powerful Army the world has ever known the the Trump's the commander-in-chief that's number two yeah and he's right there in front of a cage and he doesn't seem to care like play this it's weird and I don't know how I want him to to look but he's not like looking at the people he's kind of like looking away he's kind of like ignoring the people I mean I don't know what you're supposed to do are you supposed to look at them would that would it fill you with sorrow and despair would you not be able to uh rationalize and disconnect yourself from the humans that are suffering when you think about all of us were basically the products of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] enormous chain of events not one thing but look at they they have foil blankets man I mean this is crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] they're stacked in there stacked on top of each other wearing foil blankets yeah it's terrible that and it's look at that guys think about kids yes he's got a family back home no no his kids got separated from him yeah that too that's what he's thinking about and you know the and again man it's like I keep trying to uh get out of the like I I keep trying to get out because I I this is what I've realized because I love flipping through I go from I will jump back and forth from like Fox News to CNN MSNBC I'll check out some Tucker Carlson blast over to Rachel mat find these like like M Polar Opposites and what I feel like what's happening just as a result of the entertainment that is news is that we're getting a very non- nuanced uh we're being told what we are basically do you listen to the or watch the hill no you should watch Rising the hill it's uh Crystal and Sager and Sager is a Republican and Crystal is a Democrat and but both of them super smart and really rational and they're honest they're honest and they they're nonpartisan and they break things down based on their honest interpretation of what's going on and it's so refreshing these two right here crystal ball and Sager and Getty they are [\\xa0__\\xa0] fantastic and they I love the fact that they're friends yet she's left he's right it's not [\\xa0__\\xa0] they're not frauds you think her real name is Crystal Ball um if I my last name is ball I'd name my daughter Crystal it's dope come on you would not I call her magic crystal ball like I don't know man well cuz then every cuz you do that and you're gonna like I didn't even notice it until now because I'm not neophobic I'm not name my name is duning I am how do you think I I I just I'm sensitive to names like that CU if their real name is Crystal Ball be a third grader named crystal ball have fun well third grader you might be able to get away with it but 10th grade you're going to get tortured by the time girls reach 15 he crystal balls you know it's like a never ending you know anyway what I'm that to me it's like the the propaganda it's propaganda and uh the the reality of it is like I I I'm trying to figure out what do we all have in common it sounds like a Cheesy thing and what we all have in common is we want to be happy yeah when I talk to my my my liberal friends they want to be happy when I talk to my conservative friends they want to Bey happy and then you add to it now this is where [\\xa0__\\xa0] gets weird a lot of people want to be a hero and why wouldn't you a lot of people want to help other people they have a service mentality they would they want to die for something good A lot of people really do want to help and then that's to me where the problem start is because that's being subverted and the way it's being subverted is you know what sucks man when you're around somebody who's telling you how you feel yeah have you ever had that happen where you're around someone they're like why are you unhappy today and you're not unhappy but if you're not careful you'll be like maybe I'm unhappy and then you then you become the unhappy thing and they've like sucked you into a thing you're not and so for me this is the danger of the news is they kind of tell us how we are how we feel they first of all this ridiculous red blue [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's like stop I mean every single person I've ever met would I I don't think I've ever met anybody who wouldn't try to help someone who is drowning I think most people I meet would are like that and I think that transcends politics but somehow they got got us thinking we're all different and separate and then on top of it the thing that really bothers me and annoys me obviously man I'm no [\\xa0__\\xa0] Trump fan that guy's a lunatic and he's driving people crazy but what bothers me he is it's like can you pass that lder you're right no for sure he's driving people nuts and and it's just the way you said it and and and and and what what bothers me is that the response from like really intelligent people who consider themselves uh liberals is they're shaming these people they're shaming them they're saying oh they're idiots they're rednecks they're dumb they're peasants the stupid peasants how could you like them it's like how they liked this guy because they thought that he was going to help their families they were [\\xa0__\\xa0] they were not doing great economically he they bought into a thing and they invested themselves in it and if they are starting to like it's Dawning on them that they succumb to another American tradition which is the con artist this is an American tradition it's American artist and it's American to get sucked in by one happens to the best of us it's happened to me at a Grateful Dead concert we wanted to buy 100 hits of [\\xa0__\\xa0] acid this son of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] got us a sheet of acid convinced us to try to sell it to make more money to get more acid we left there with one mushroom stem on the way back to Hendersonville I've been conned I know what it's like it's a very American thing but it's like so there was no asset at all dude he's no he we got we took our money to buy acid and then he's like we could sell this acid and buy more acid and then you know we're like yeah let's do it and then he sold the acid I guess and then we were going to buy more the point is like he started a business what he my friend almost gave him his [\\xa0__\\xa0] car like this was a very charismatic hippie he was like looked exactly the way he'd expect him a [\\xa0__\\xa0] hippie bandana big hippie beard some people are good at that and it's weird and they do weird things like they talk a little too close to you to make you uncomfortable yeah they use uh what's it neurolinguistic programming they like they like they just get you and they know how to talk you you know when I used to work at Newport crey uh some I'd work the register sometimes and we had lessons on how to deal with Flim Flam artists that's what they called them flimflam artists so they would teach you so we had to uh sit there and be taught like how someone will [\\xa0__\\xa0] you up like soell something will cost three bucks and they'll give you a 20 and they'll say hey uh can you give me a 10 and a five and then the rest in quarters and you're like what how much is that and then before you know and he's saying something else and talking over you and you think you owe him $40 like you're giving him more money he like I gave you 50 so you give me the 20 that 20 and then what is it it was three bucks so you owe me 47 so like before you know it you're giving money away and you don't understand what's happening especially when you're a kid I was like I think I was 16 when I was working there I was a monkey basically a monkey right and you know these people travel all over the place and they do this to folks they just trick them they pickpocket them like watching David bla do car tricks okay from as close as you are to me I don't get it I don't know what he's doing he can get me every time he's he's going to trick me every time he's so good at it and there's guys that are I don't know if they're at that level but there's guys at a level that you or I can't perceive and they'll steal your watch like there's guys who can get your watch off yeah like they can get your watch off I don't know how they do it but it's a known thing it's a known thing the guys know how to get your watch off [\\xa0__\\xa0] guys I mean how many videos on YouTube there's awesome videos of like children doing this to people you could see like kids like get trained to do this it's like they it's hacking our operating system essentially he stuffed a card into my friend Jeff's watch band and Jeff didn't even know it was in there and he's like look it's there and he's like what he looks at his watchband he'll like pull it out and it's the card he was looking for folded up tucked into his watch P you're like what what did you just do so if that guy's a thief if he was like some like oh is this someone stealing something yeah there's a whole genre of YouTube video oh boy look at that wow little tiny kids y they're trained wow they're trained to steal they practice Yeah they practice to do it I mean this is just a look we see this on the human realm and we're like oh my God they're children you see a coral reef and a little fish come and take food from another fish it's like just totally normal I mean it's not even this is just part of being in a hive you know did that guy just steal that guy's watch is that what just happened bro back that up that was crazy look watch how this guy bumps into this guy he takes his watch watch this is that what he did no no the guy still had a watch on what did he steal I don't know I think the bottles you'll never know I'm I'm too high for this I'm too high for this but i' I've never seen anybody take someone's watch off but I know it's real thing like guys can actually take your watch off like I mean like one with a strap where they do the Buckle it's annoying for you to do yeah dude I like to me this is a natural part of the environment we're in how many things camouflage themselves as other things take energy out of a system using the camouflage it's completely [\\xa0__\\xa0] normal it's nature so you you get this Trump and you get people who fell for it and now those people are deeply invested in that HP like magic trick which he did and by the way this is another thing it's like look you don't have to like somebody like I don't like Charles Manson yeah but man I do recognize like how [\\xa0__\\xa0] entertaining he is you know what I mean like that's a very entertaining cult leader similarly with Trump not a fan you know the moment he said he implied you should shoot looters all the look we can go on and on with antib I'm not I'm not talking about that I'm saying the problem is that that our tactic As Americans is not supposed to be we listen to the state and get our cues about how to be good people from the state our As Americans what we do is we have like basic fundamental ideas that are really [\\xa0__\\xa0] beautiful one of them being that we like believe that people have a right to be free and and seek their own personal happiness that's beautiful man that's not we shouldn't have the state telling us different versions of what that is we we have to be intelligent and autonomous enough to do that for ourselves and then from that like really be a a United States and and like what's happening now is these [\\xa0__\\xa0] uh are are not unifying us this is supposed to be the United States of America that's what it's supposed to be so if you're in a government official here and you're doing a thing that's making it all divided and [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and you're telling lies and you're shaming people for telling the truth it doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat whatever you are as as far as I'm concerned anti-American which is like man Americans and and [\\xa0__\\xa0] anybody who gets mad at me for saying this Americans are beautiful people we we both tour we get to meet people all over the [\\xa0__\\xa0] place and talk to them and they're always generally wonderful yes some of them will take your [\\xa0__\\xa0] watch you know what I mean but still still you know in general in general that you you encounter when things were going well see this is the thing that shifts everything is co the reason why everybody's ramped up I mean it's not no small feet it's not just about getting sick it's about everybody being scared that they're going to lose loved ones or they're going to die or they're going to lose lung function you can't work so you're worried about your income there's so many people whose businesses are eroding right before their eyes their eyes I mean imagine if you own commercial real estate now Jesus Christ and you you you you start thinking of the prospect of leasing a building that you invested all your money in out to some folks they're not going to have offices like that anymore people are going to do [\\xa0__\\xa0] from home there's a lot of people that are actually more productive working from home I know it's it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] up time so everybody's on eight everybody's walking around on eight trying to keep it together that's right and so a guy like trump exacerbates it cuz he doesn't ever come out with a Unity speech yeah it's always like a he's always the strong boss you're fired I'm the man it's I mean this is the message and it works with a lot of people it's a good look it's it's like comedy or music not not everything works on everybody but there's a lot of people that Vibe with his [\\xa0__\\xa0] real cartoonish version of being the boss right but it's not a bring everybody together thing and that's this is what we need we need the guy in the movie that stands on top of the hill the guy that says we have more ins similarity than we do that we disagree with man we're together we're friends most people most of our issues we could work out amicably we could talk most of our issues the vast majority and we need to not just dwell on those but Embrace those like embrace all the things we like we want safe schools for our kids we want Safe Streets we we want a um [\\xa0__\\xa0] Bridge maintenance so the bridges don't collapse we want everybody to be okay yeah we want no crime we want we we don't want unjust prison we don't want people being unjustly accused and then sentenced to life in jail and other people to work forever to get them we don't want any of that we don't want any prosecutors that hide evidence that shows that a person was innocent that's real today in 2020 they don't even get in trouble for it yeah man it's right it's it's true and I think that the only the maybe this is naive I think we got to get over our addiction to the person on the hill we got to get over our addiction to the idea that the way we govern is the only way to govern that's it and that's why when I see that what was it called again a Chaz you know again like yeah to me it's not to me what I'm seeing there is at the very least a radical experiment and a potential now it's a temper tantrum by some 20-year-old kids who hate capitalism how old were the founding fathers and that's a good question but they didn't have YouTube I think they would have formed a much better opinion well the the whole and this is the other part of it like so I I keep thinking about and again man this is where my case is going to start falling apart but that's okay I don't mind if my case falls apart the for me it's I keep thinking like okay so what are they telling us now how to feel they're saying well either you're a socialist or a capitalist or a communist or tell me what kind of IST I am or what ISM I'm into and I keep thinking like man can't there isn't it possible with all the technology we have that there's a new ISM that that no one's that doesn't have the first part of the word attached to it good point so it's like and and and so at the very least if you meet someone who's like in Passionate in a real way not in a [\\xa0__\\xa0] way by the way man because like there's a big difference between like you you know right away when you run into somebody who's trying to tell you how to be it's horrible it's a even even if it's in a light way it's such a it's so drones some like some people want you sick some people want you destabilized and like unbalanced some one one thing is for sure people don't want you to know who you are cuz if you know who you are they can't tell you who you are but but you know if you run into someone who's legitimately UT a utopian here we go get ready to lose [\\xa0__\\xa0] viewers right now baby this is where people press stop on Spotify go on to like listen to like my favorite murder or whatever but I was at Burning Man and stop stop stop stop stop hey man I am sure burning man is like everything else in the world there's a lot of profound conversations and few of them that want to make you just bury your head in the sand definitely and and and but one this guy came up to you just getting these great chats and this guy came up to me we're just yapping and he said do you think world peace is possible he wasn't being a missionary or anything just asking just asking it's a real question but it's so cliche that it seems like a joke question that a [\\xa0__\\xa0] would ask you isn't that funny like what would you want more than that world equality World Financial equality world peace there's like four or five things you would ever say like look that might cure up a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah that's right and but to ask it is so cliche like everybody Burning Man what well that's a that's we're peace well you know and that's other thing if like let's say you're at the Venice boardwalk and some son of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dressed like Uncle Sam comes and ask you that you're going to like go the other direction like [\\xa0__\\xa0] you like you're just GNA leave right maybe if you get out of Nicaragua man yeah yeah but but he was actually somebody who's really into Buckminster Fuller and I think that was something Buckminster Fuller put out there which is like this this question is very important and you should you should ask yourself this as an individual because if you think world peace is possible right uh even if you acknowledge that maybe right now it's not possible but if you can invent in your mind some technology some or even if you can invent in your mind like an X like an algebra for a thing you don't have the space for yet but it could be if there's any sense in you at all that world piece is possible then from that point forward you should be part of whatever it is that's going to make us have that great utopian ideal that transcends American borders and because the that's the other problem is the American dream thing it's confined It's Not The American Dream It's the human dream the human dream is the intuition we all have that there's a way for us to be on the planet together that doesn't involve blowing each other up right and that's I think it's possible I think it's possible I just don't know how it would be how to get there necessarily but I think it's possible and one thing's for sure whenever you get a trump or any [\\xa0__\\xa0] pundit blowing out divisive [\\xa0__\\xa0] into people's brains they are not draw if there's like a scale one Sid's World Peace one side's chaos they're dropping they're dropping their their Pebbles on the chaos part of the scale and it's like you why why do you think they're doing that cuz man let me tell you there's a lot of money to be made in [\\xa0__\\xa0] chaos man there's a lot of money I mean isn't that what an engine is an engine is kind of like controlled explosions do you remember when Trump talked openly once about the military-industrial comp complex yeah and he said they want to go to war yeah and you're like what the problem is he says so many other things that are ridiculous I know if only he just said that if only he just said that the problem with him saying that is you can go yeah yeah yeah but he also called this chicky [\\xa0__\\xa0] the horse face like you know he and you go oh yeah that's not that nice like he he had he had a he had a thing there like a moment like an isenhower moment not quite as eloquent but when Eisenhower was on television and he warned people about the military-industrial complex as he was leaving office that's to this day like one of the most profound speeches I've ever seen because it gives me a chill because I think well this is black and white from how many [\\xa0__\\xa0] years ago if this [\\xa0__\\xa0] was going on then it's not like it stopped going on didn't stop we see one of the reasons why we're in such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] up space politically is because this is the first time where politics have been really exposed to the General Public by the internet like you you have a different access to politics you never had before you have real time things breaking you find out like if someone like Gavin Newsome said he was going to take a pay cut he didn't Fox News princess it goes W and you get all these stories like oh would you have known that before cell phones and the internet you would have never known that he didn't do that you would have to be a person who's really into politics and there's not that many of them most people are busy so now politics relies on scandals and Scandals are weasel people through that's it so the thing about scandals is not everybody's a good person right and if you if you do a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] up [\\xa0__\\xa0] but you own it the way Trump did people didn't count on the [\\xa0__\\xa0] vote cuz there's a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] out there and finally they had a king they're like this is our King [\\xa0__\\xa0] you magga they wear the [\\xa0__\\xa0] sunglasses and they talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] to Ted Cruz at rallies those guys finally had a king and that that's like we didn't there was no King on the other side there was no King the compassionate intelligent King who actually made sense well that's the sad part that's what we don't have think how how depressing your very astute observation is in the sense that the idea was we weren't going to have a [\\xa0__\\xa0] monarchy here yeah that was the whole point and now we elect a monarchy yeah yeah that's the whole point man and it's like and again it's like look if like if you start playing the game that you're the smart person in the room and that if people disagree with you they must be dumb if people have ideas than you they must be stupid and then you start shaming them what can you what all you're doing is creating this like you're going to create a reaction to that and the reaction is going to be a celebration of every single thing you're with your great vast Elite intelligence to riding you know and so I think you know that's the problem is it's like I it's just there's nothing worse than when like people who are legitimately smart have read a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] books have got master's degrees have not developed enough compassion to understand that just about every single person on the planet wants to be happy wants to have a full stomach doesn't want to hurt anybody and would run into a building on fire to save somebody most everybody I would say I would say at least 90% a large percentage a large percentage and these [\\xa0__\\xa0] are are shaming them and telling them they're idiot or they're stupid or this and that it's like [\\xa0__\\xa0] you man you don't know what these people came up through you don't know these people were born into Like Houses filled with [\\xa0__\\xa0] methamphetamin smoke M whose parents were like you know absolutely [\\xa0__\\xa0] insane and they still managed to get out and get a job and have a [\\xa0__\\xa0] life and pay taxes and now your [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass is going to tell these people who didn't have the [\\xa0__\\xa0] trust fund that you had that got you into the [\\xa0__\\xa0] ivy league university they're [\\xa0__\\xa0] idiots shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up stop they're not and then I'm shaming those people that's the problem the idea is like you're not shaming them you're just honestly Illuminating their their their current situation let's just let I don't think it's shaming them yeah it's time to like let go of the whole like snoody thing it's time to also on the other side it's time to let go of like every single one of these people must be like burning candles to mik in their backyard thing too like let's let go of the all those stories for a second I'm not saying there aren't people burning candles to mik I've never definely are I've never met I've seen the Bohemian Grove video is that mik yes that's mik the owl God when Alex Jones and John Ronson's no it's Molech they they were talking about is it Molech is how youon Al Al according to Alex uh John Ronson and Alex Jones they snuck in Bohemian Grove this was when everybody was saying it was all [\\xa0__\\xa0] and I I say this many times and I'll say it some more give me that later you got it Fred Alex Jones he's he's made some mistakes and some big ones but he's also actually exposed some real [\\xa0__\\xa0] and he owns up to the mistakes he's made they're not good he doesn't think they're good the there's a thing about finding conspiracies everywhere that's not good for your brain I really believe this I think that if you go looking for those things and that's all you look for and you look for them all the time you can get real paranoid and real crazy and then there's also a bunch of people that are trying to stop you from doing that because you do expose some crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know he was talking about Epstein a long time ago I know a long time ago he was saying there was a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Island and and they take all these rich politicians and and some celebrities and they bang these kids and I was like come on he was telling me this a long time ago so he's also the one who told me about Bohemian Grove well I actually watched it from that's I think this tape was actually made before I met him so he went and snuck in to this place where like former president go there's a photograph of it's uh Ronald Reagan with Herbert Walker Bush and a couple other people all standing around and it's like these are the people that used to hang out at this place and they would put on robes and they would worship an hour God owl God and they would burn an effigy and they're playing and Alex snuck in and made video footage of this [\\xa0__\\xa0] and then no one's denying that it's real this really did happen they're so they're in with these bankers and former presidents and they're dressed like Druids and and some guy brings over something that it's an effigy that's supposed to be a body a wrapped up Effigy it's a bunch of sticks in BL in a blanket but it's like shaped like a body and they drop it on the fire and they're all worshiping an owl God why is that bad imagine if you saw those if that's what your business is just finding those things how crazy you think you get first of all wait then you add in vodka and head wounds wait wait wait hold on wait go to the Vodka headwinds part what do you Jones okay I got you lot of vodka he had a bad head injury God damn it man when I was in Liberal art school man there's this great teacher who changed my life Sam Scoville and he one of the things he taught was so beautiful he still teaches there one of the things he taught was figure out a way to take in all information and then filter out the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's not real and keep the real stuff and like you know Alex Jones is like let's yeah some of the stuff is real take what's real and throw there's a good chunk of it that's real like I remember he was telling me that that there's government's using chemicals to turn frogs gay I was like what what are you talking about he goes yes he goes pesticides are turning frogs gay and I'm like that can't be real no there really is is that true yes there's pesticides that change Frog's genders what yes yes but some pesticide [\\xa0__\\xa0] with Frog's genders that sucks maybe it doesn't I mean depends on the Frog maybe it's awesome for the FR maybe frog don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] cuz they've never been taught homophobia they don't care who they [\\xa0__\\xa0] but there's a real thing that see you find that it's it's a pesticide that has some sort of an effect an unintended effect on frogs genders dude that's another thing that people don't talk about pesticides that have been used in like golf courses and like there's people who live around those that's a chemical dump yeah golf courses are F pesticide atrazine can turn male frogs into females cool so there's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] pesticide that changes the gender or should I say the sex is it the same thing I have to sex and gender hey I'm not getting sucked into that [\\xa0__\\xa0] black hole Rogan you can keep that [\\xa0__\\xa0] to yourself but hey I'll get sucked into another black hole isn't that crazy though well yeah before we get into the that that stuff I want to say this real quick okay is that camera on me friends at the Bohemian Grove future friends I should say I just want you to know I don't know much about you I I know Alex Jones you know probably on vodka drinks I don't think he was then I think he was sober he started drinking after all this please don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] this up for me sorry sorry so you had an infiltrator look I went to a summer camp we have bonfires we wore robes I mean not like maybe what you do I just want to say hey come on invite me please I won't tell anybody anything I've heard you guys are pretty awesome actually what I've heard is the idea was to get a bunch of Hardcore neocons together and then mix some artist in in the hopes that like having like brushing shoulders with artists would in some way shape or form loosen some people up a little bit and I've also heard you have a tram that connects campsites there to other campsites meaning you just get in the tram and suddenly you're hanging out with Dick Cheney listen I won't tell anybody I got a podcast I won't even tell Joe let me in I'll worship mik I won't worship mik if it means hurting people but I don't understand why people are upset about [\\xa0__\\xa0] by the way they that you [\\xa0__\\xa0] video why is what's wrong with worshiping nothing this is the so excited this is the thing that I get confused about here it's like in our country we've got people who are Christian yes and that's beautiful thing and I do love Jesus I was reading the book of Mark today regarding the parable of the S but that being said I don't think it's fair necessarily to tell people they can't worship an owl or burn an effigy in front of an owl and some kind of symbolic magical ritual that represents the disintegration of your negative energy or whatever it may be I really don't know but that be you know to me that's the other problem that's happening right now is like Superstition is R running rampant I'm friends with lots of witches I know a few satanists and I know a few people are under the occult and I don't know a single one of them that would tolerate child abuse I don't know a single one that wouldn't kill somebody some of them would kill people if they thought they were hurting kids not and make it so that nobody found the body some of the Satanist know they would kill some they would kill someone probably I don't know for sure I'm not trying to throw any Satanist under the bus but I'm just saying like this idea that we can't have alter alternate Pagan religions in our country without immediately being associated with human sacrifice or child abuse I think that goes against the American Spirit it's like look because people don't want to subscribe to your particular like very popular Global religion doesn't necessarily implicate them in like something that is truly a horror which is human trafficking so to me this is the problem is like man we got to be a little bit more nuanced in our apprehend in our conceptualization of these people again I don't know what's going on at the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Bohemian Grove but from what I've heard it's basically a summer camp for billionaires where they try to get artists in there to like loosen them up a little bit that's what I've heard I could be wrong who told you this is this I honestly can't [\\xa0__\\xa0] say h h interesting look man I don't know and I know and I've seen have you seen the video of Bohemian Grove have you seen it the the the the ritual in front of the AL God have you seen it yeah dude go come with me to Burning Man and you will see that every every 50 feet sure look I don't think it's that big of a deal I really don't if it involves hurting kids it's a big deal and if these [\\xa0__\\xa0] are doing anything that involves Human Sacrifice hurting human beings in in in a in any application of that of course then it's the worst thing on Earth and I'm so sorry that I said anything about it but I don't think I don't think that's what this is I mean obviously what we're seeing is not that we don't know what else happens but what you're seeing is them burning sticks in front of this uh owl God and it's like this crazy um crazy uh Speech they're giv while it's going on it's it's really weird hey can we hear some of it the speech I don't know where the speech is in the video I found another video where they like stabilize the footage the oh it's like uh but I mean before before this nobody really believed that listen care and all the winds make carry with th docks hail fellowship's Eternal Flame once again Midsummer sets us free and now they're they're lighting the effigy on fire and everybody's cheering it looks fun Stanley cubrick had this uh quote once to uh Nicole Kidman I think it was they were working on Eyes Wide Shut see if you can find what she said about the elites that he that he had said say I I know I saved it I can find it if I have chance to look at my laptop but it was something about him you know talking about the the powers that run the world and that they all have something on each other that's how they all can stay together they all compromise each other that's what Skull and Bones was about like that's what all that stuff is about so he had a much more concise quote on that but when you see something like that you go well maybe it's like fun that they do it that nobody knows they do it you know what I'm saying yeah like maybe it's like one of those rituals where you get together your dad thinks it's hilarious and you both put your hoods on you go out there and you burn the owl or you burn the sticks in front of the owl and what's fun is that you're not supposed to be doing it and it's a secret but nothing really is happening that's also on the table yeah it's possible but it it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] weird man that was weird imagine if there was no Catholic Church imagine if you are a billionaire that's what you're doing with your weekend but imagine if there was no Catholic church and there was one video of a mass right we would be like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up imagine any religious ceremony if there was only one version of it cuz I I I'm not trying to reduce it to summer camp fun or even like fraternity games there's a who knows what it is right we we just you can know what it is yeah they'd have to tell us but we just see something crazy but it's not evil I mean what is it well it's for me it's a question mark I I don't really know I know that my just dress weird my my tendency whenever I have a question mark is to assign malevolence to it just out of a basic kind of weakness in my own bias like if I don't know what a thing is like you know when you're waiting for the doctor to call regarding some Scan they just did on you you you know if you if you have the slightest fear of death or any kind of bias in you then that space in between when you when maybe we're overlooking this maybe it's like their version of Renaissance Fair and people just want to escape reality and pretend that they live with mik the hour God and throw a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Hood over your head and yes please and peace be with you yeah I mean it it could be some kind of like Pagan celebration you know and if you look back at like the history of paganism or Hedonism or Terence McKenna does such a great job talking about the elu cidian Mysteries and the you know all these like things that aren't really quite as accessible as the main main religions of the world all the religions of the world they have this beautiful quality in them depending on the religion and generally one of the qualities is so beautiful is a mechanism of self forgiveness and a mechanism of purification the a general assessment of the human condition as being somewhat depraved I how many like the puking in iasa you're purging yourself from your Darkness the confession booth in Catholicism uh maybe you could say in gnosticism like true nosis or in Buddhism like connecting with like actual reality versus your overlayed reality or you know it goes on and on this is all within each one is this idea of like there's a way for us to ritualistically uh create if you want to be a pure scientific materialist a beautiful placebo effect that gets you to drop some of your neurotic qualities or the very least reset your intention to make the world a better place and anything whatever that I don't care what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] it is whatever it may be if that's what it what it's all about is a recognition like man you beat yourself up every day you're so hard on yourself you beat yourself up for all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you did in the past and and and we live in a world right now where there's not much tolerance there's not much forgiveness and and and anything that allows a a kind of like steam valve from which all that [\\xa0__\\xa0] can get released so from this day forward you're born again you're brand new I don't care if it's an owl man go if you think that's crazy look at like Main Street Disneyland any night that's some crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] to watch too and some people's entire lives I'm not being like changed from like having a great night anywhere so you know to me it's like ritual is not scary to me what's scary to me though I is uh any that objectifies humans enslaves humans uh uh hurts kids and so yeah Human Sacrifice any of that stuff and if that's what's really happening there I truly don't know then I completely apologize for any defense sticks it's just sticks the question is was it always just sticks did it used to be people did they used to sacrifice a person did they stop doing it at one point in time one widely cited Nicole Kidman interview was made up by the fake news site news punch you sons of [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] God damn it they got me they got you but again does it say what the quote is yeah what is the quote he said the Hollywood's run by pedophiles or something like I found the Reddit page where it was put up and God damn they got me they glad I asked you hey you want to see something real creepy can Jamie may I ask you to look something up look up the that there's a a video of a van that was actually used for human trafficking I saw that that [\\xa0__\\xa0] is chilling terrify chilling and it's like to me it's like man if we're gonna be it is there anybody who is at the Helm of the ship that's fighting those [\\xa0__\\xa0] right now deserves medals and I hope that they never stop what they're doing I just want them to be very precise in their attacks that's all don't dilute your position by getting caught up in something and again I am not I'm already going to get attacked for this saying like Doug it works for the blah blah I don't I I don't I'm a Buddhist and I I go to romdas Retreats and burning man but and if they invited me to the Bohemian Grove I go and if I went there and I saw that I was going to say if Stanley cuber can keep keep a secret we can too are you saying you would go to the Grove with me yes that' be awesome tell anybody but you know if you and I were invited there and we saw anything happening that was anything to do with like what people I would think it would be a trap and they would be setting us up they would put on like some sort of fake thing just to make us look like fools that we talk about it on our podcast do you know man if we ever do a movie together that's the movie like it should be all your friends going to the bo get invited to the Bohemian group exactly right like I become friends with some guy who's like a banker who really likes comedy yeah right and then this guy tells you he gets drunk one night like I I know the Illuminati they're real the Bilderberg Group it's real like what yeah man Jackal Island it's a they made the federal Institute it's not even from America man and you're like what what and then this guy starts un unraveling the tale of America can I tell you something crazy the Federal Reserve yeah people in my family used to own parts of Jackal Island okay tell the story of Jackal Island cuz that's what I'm talking about if people don't know it well here's the problem I don't know the story like I I I remember hearing some [\\xa0__\\xa0] I have like two paragraphs in my head memorized I remember hearing people in my family had some claim on land there and that they sold it and I since then I was just kind of resentful because it's like they sold it for nothing and like if they'd held on to it like you know I would be at the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Bohemian Grove and so Jackal Island supposed to be the place where they invented the Federal Reserve right I I went there's a great hotel is that it Jamie what does it say listen this all disclaimer figure where to look we're all three of us are morons yes okay this is not that's one thing that drives me crazy there's one of the things about silencing people that are crazy online I can tell when someone's crazy and part of someone being crazy is you see these crazy people and you go oh I think they might be crazy and then you look in you go yeah none of none of what they're saying makes sense they actually are crazy but damn that was pretty close yeah dude you got to be the thing about people saying things that other people disagree with when they want to silence those people is you don't think that other people are smart as you you're thinking that's going to work on other people someone's saying that the Earth is flat and there's lizard people that control the sunrise if that was you you'd go okay you know what I'm saying it wouldn't work so why not let someone say it so if someone says it it doesn't work on you but what are you worried about you're worried it's going to work on somebody else that's what you're worried about you worri it's going to and that's the weird thing about Co because it's the one thing where you're not allowed to do that anymore because if you do anything that goes against the government by lines anything that goes against what the World Health Organization thinks you should do or CDC thinks you should do you get kicked off of YouTube you get silenced everybody gets removed whether you're right or wrong it's the one thing where you can't talk crazy you can talk crazy about the Earth being hollow you can talk about being that are made out of light that fly in and out of our Consciousness and that's responsible for all of our ideas and you could talk about how there's an application that's coming in 2023 it's right now being vetted by the NSA to make sure that we can use it so we can communicate with the aliens you can have all these whacko videos where you're making [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and no one cares but if you say that masks don't help and what we need to do is uh get healthier they'll remove you from YouTube well that's the fire and a crowded theater thing like you can't yell fire in a crowded theater so so like the pro like look the problem with it is to me is I like have like gone through every single stage of grief over YouTube is a bad um analogy maybe a better analogy is you can open up businesses as long as you do it carefully I Used to Love YouTube man I used to love it I still love it well what I loved about it in the old days I still love it I still go on every day but what I loved about in the old days is what you're saying no one's putting a cork in the champagne bottles it wild it was it was a museum of Madness and you would and what was even better as the algorithm was working in your favor so it's like punch in Hollow Earth yes that's going to take you all the way to like some crazy deep [\\xa0__\\xa0] and never once in all my Explorations on on the early days of YouTube was I like this could be real it was more like wow look at how all the different versions of reality that people are processing and and it was a joy but I think what happened probably is like people realize like God like what we've got like you talk about this ties bad the nightmare when and it will happen when primates figure how to like use friction to make fire you talk about this yes and that's a nightmare for the planet like you think the [\\xa0__\\xa0] shit's bad now wait till the chimps figure out guns yeah just fire just fire just figure out how to make their own fire think think of like the beginning the when like if the Proto homed shift into like figure out really good point you know this is trouble imagine think of how many people died in the beginning of like discovering fire oh my God how many experiments were done with fire how many things were just set on fire how many people just burn I can eat it I bet you can eat it let me eat it I'll get its energy in my body holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] he melted his face off you know so similarly like with with the internet we have this F we have this new fire and like people who are like in the conduits of the fire are are are I think they're they're having this really rotten come to Jesus moment where they're like cuz I think a lot of these especially if you look in the Silicon Valley these people are freaks the early day like the people making technology they're nuts I seen you that Steve Jobs thing with him in a commune or whatever these people are [\\xa0__\\xa0] crazy but I think they're recognizing that like it it's like okay the internet is the new Fire yeah and and and so and they're starting to understand that like because of them because of their intentional manipulative Cod voting because of their deep study of BF Skinner and behaviorism they've produced this hypers seductive semi sentient information dispersal device that is driving people who don't have the immune system to data that you're supposed to naturally get from school crazy that's what's happening and so people are going nuts because it's like well add that with the addictive quality of Technology those two things together The Addictive quality just looking at like your phone and getting information off your phone and then add it to all this stuff that you're saying yeah man and and it's a crazy combination and there I think Google and YouTube and as much as like you know and I do think censorship's [\\xa0__\\xa0] I would hate to be in anybody's position there because on one hand you're looking at like a very liberal very beautiful idea which is like everyone should be allowed to say whatever they want to say and then it's meeting like well but what about these hyper charismatic seductive people who like Hitler you know what I mean like so now you run into this terrible place of like and also we know that there's people who don't quite have the ability to discern what's real from what's not but we allow this is my beef we allow some of that because we allow evangelists I heard Robert Tien on one of his shows yeah he goes every time you write a check to me Satan gets a black eye good dude it was in my act for a while I was like where's my checkbook you Satan you son of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude it's imagine you could steal money that way it's look man I I don't but you know what I'm saying yeah I do know exactly what you're saying and it's like this type of con Artistry also cigarettes oh you know it's like this type of con Artistry generally it seems like there's some kind of Grandfather claws on specific styles of of of thievery and murder yeah yeah cuz cigarettes like they know they're killing people imagine if you had bubble gum that killed a half a million people a year just bubble it's like bubble gum but just people just dying stop selling that [\\xa0__\\xa0] what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are you doing what are you doing you're see well people have a right to chew their bubble gum a lot of people like bubbles yeah that's right that's all it was it's like you chewing bubbles makes you happy and everybody's dying of cancer and this company's making $500 billion dollar a year something like how much do they make on cigarettes yeah how much let's let's guess let's guess what do you how much what do you think the an by the way I want to say it before this is a box of cigars okay Mike binder gave me that and he gave me that one over there another box of cigars I'm not anti-tobacco in any way shape or form I'm a pro- free choice person you absolutely should be able to smoke cigarettes and I think you absolutely should be able to sell them because I don't want to roll my own and if I want a cigarette as a grown [\\xa0__\\xa0] man you can I want to be able to have a cigarette but cigarettes do kill a half a million people in this country every year yeah or they're going to die anyway right cigarettes kill them early or they die directly because of diseases that you can get from smoking cigarettes and their kids get sick dude the worst Man kids that live in Greg fit Simmons he has lung problems to this day because his parents chain smoked and they lived in massachus cold my mom did but she quit when I was really young did when I was like six I were you in the car with her when she smoked I I must have been with the windows up I don't well we lived in New Jersey so it cold in the winter I'm sure I was I don't think she smoked in the car with her kids though dude do you mind if I have a little more of this [\\xa0__\\xa0] have a drink at all man it's so good uh I I remember Fletcher North Carolina middle of winter you'd go down and wait for the bus my friend Jimmy Fink I think it was Jimmy Fink his mom would like let us get in her car to wait for the bus it's wonderful very sweet but also I think and I'm sorry Jimmy if you're out there I know we haven't talked in a long time I still love you though but like and I'm sorry if it's not you and I'm getting confused here but the I just remember she smoked and we like there was smoke in the car my dad smoked I would ride in the car with him on trips and he would smoke and you'd breathe in the smoke and like so so to me like where and again like this is always the problem which is like clearly we need regul there has to be some regulatory principle in the world if there are people who steal watches there mean that means there's going to be groups of people who get together and talk about better ways to steal watches if there's groups of people get together talk about better ways to steal watches and then we create a way for them to form a thing called like a corporation you know what I mean you got you need to regulate that that's why we need regulation so but then the problem is is like who does the regulating and what what's the incentive for you to regulate is there a financial incentive yeah The Regulators get paid an exorbitant amount of money let's say you and I start a vape pen company that like is a nicotine vape pen and then start pouring money into people who against tobacco knowing if we can make tobacco illegal but keep the vape pens legal we're going to become the new tobacco but here's the thing about vape pens this is the real thing about VAP pens some of them are not good for you at all they're real bad for you and there's a connection there're saying now between covid and uh kids that Vape kids that Vape dying of Co or getting serious covid but it makes sense I have a friend who's got a kid that sucks on one of them things things all day long just just Vapes constantly kids vape and these kids that Vape all the time like the oils that you're taking into your lungs That's not healthy the idea that it's not cigarettes so it's healthy no it's there's a lot of evidence that points to some of those companies that make those oils they don't do it in a way where you know there's like different kinds of oils and they have the different reactions to the Heat and some of them are like am I saying this right let's check on this what is the problem with the different types of Vapes because I think there was one type of oil that they're using you because they have to they have to somehow or another mix the same with the marijuana ones you have to mix this stuff with the THC and it's some sort of chemical but there's different you can do it organically like I know they've done it with um uh coconut oil I know they've done it with like things like that it's the same way with hash man I think it's like the the way people make hash varies and some people there's a healthy way to make it and the obviously the way using the most chemicals is the cheapest and so there's certain types of hash that you I think are derive and again my friends out there look I don't know but it's something like butane someone told me this at a at a marijuana store I can't remember what but yeah man it's like concern is the oil like what kind of oil like I know there's one guy that was selling them the with MCT oil okay here it is authorities in the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and preven ition still aren't sure what's causing the dangerous Trend but theories range from issues with vegetable oil and vape juice to the idea that doctors are just now taking note of a problem that's been percolating for a long time so okay so that was a speculation that people were using um like if you try to cook okay and you try to like sear a steak and you do it with olive oil you're going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] it up because olive oil is it's not like something that you really um sear something with like you put olive oil in you don't you don't want to get it that hot yeah olive oil is more something that you'd like to sauté with but other oils like avocado oil or um or beef fat like that stuff is amazing because you can get it really [\\xa0__\\xa0] hot and it has a very very high uh temperature where it turns to smoke right so it's like healthier for you the idea so if you're misting this stuff into your lungs you don't want it burnt right right you want something that's more so I would imagine if you're using these cheap this is again I'm a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I'm not a scientist but we're doing science if you're using a vape Vape pen with like some really shitty canola oil and you're getting that burnt spray inside your lungs like that could be terrible for you terrible you got some [\\xa0__\\xa0] GMO cornn syrup [\\xa0__\\xa0] in your lungs yeah you know the haunting thing man you go to a pharmacy right and you watch as the pharmacist dispenses the drugs how careful he is right like they are like so careful in their administration of these pills because they know if like for one second you give someone Xanax when they were supposed to get penicillin killed somebody right so you have to be very careful but like meanwhile look at us right now Joe did you do a test on that bottle of booze are these I didn't even I honestly it was embarrassing I'm like I don't know how to light this blunt but then like I'm smoking something called dadrass I don't know what's in this [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't do any studies here I just that's for people who love Steely Dan I I do love Steely Dan do too they have some great [\\xa0__\\xa0] songs you know what I mean I'm saying like the general like in in America and anywhere The General sense is I'm going to eat it if you give it to me especially if it's in a colorful box and then you're like it must be okay and and the problem is is like sometimes it's not okay look at thalomid man like you know look at like the big moments in history when it was shown like actually sometimes the stuff we sell you is that theide theide that's the stuff that gave kids birth def facts yeah or what was that radioactive [\\xa0__\\xa0] they painted on watches oh my god dude we did a whole show where talked about all the diseases that people got from idium was that what it was Jamie what was the radium radium idium the they were using it for all kinds of things and people's faces were rotting off yeah literally they have holes in their face they were painting it on watches cuz it it would glow it was cool looking but so so similarly it's like they were using it for makeup I think right yeah and here we have the internet here we have the [\\xa0__\\xa0] internet suddenly we have a hyper a way to like super connect with every single person on the planet but not just connect with every person on the planet we have an artificial intelligence based on a neural network I don't understand how it works suggesting who you should connect with you know what I mean it's like is the internet the thalidomide technological thalidomide are we looking at a I think so is that what we were dealing with right now and like I think we're on a spaceship and we haven't quite figured out how to slow it down or where the brakes are or how do you go left or right yeah but the spaceship is being propelled by thoughts and ideas and social media and world events and drugs and sex and politics and power and control and it's all just hurling through space and while while it's all happened we haven't quite figured out where the breaks are or what's the best way to be harmonious with each other so we're all in this constant battle for control thinking that once we get in control we're going to set this [\\xa0__\\xa0] ship straight and everybody's going to be cool we're going to be finally we're going to get along because you're side one but you're still going to have half the [\\xa0__\\xa0] country that hates you half the country that doesn't agree with you half the country that has to like be really tolerant in order to engage you in any of your ideas and admit that you're right right yeah and this is what we're doing and it's not real it's not real I don't think it's real I think a lot of the people that have ideas in one way if they could just talk to people in in in in the realm of the area where they have disagreement I bet they could work it out I think the problem is more people not talking than anything Joe tell me about the spaceship idea some more cuz I don't think you're saying some like knowing you like I know you I wonder if you're saying that metaphorically or like if there's it is metaphorically but it's also actual we are on a spaceship whether we like it or not we're spinning a thousand miles an hour and we're driving through Infinity at a pace that if you if it was small and it passed by you you would go holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah what was it if it was if the Earth was the size of a baseball and it whipped by you in real time the way it's moving through the universe you would be like [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's what the Earth's doing but the Earth is huge yeah it's huge and yet it's tiny and it's surrounded by things that are enormous got a sun that's a million times bigger than us just a fireball in the sky that all life on Earth depends on a very clear space between Earth and the Sun a perfect balance perfect balance between this Unstoppable heat and just keep the water melted don't boil it man and we're hurling through infinity and while we're doing that we're trying to pick who gets to be the leader to steal your tax money we're trying to tell you you can't go to a beauty shop CU I don't want you get in a cough that's right we're trying to tell people stay home stay home Trump's trying to kill America y it's the wrong approach like the approach they're making the the approach they should make it should be all about positivity you know everybody who's voting knows who Trump is everybody knows about the riots everybody knows about everybody knows all those things talk about what you want to do yeah talk about what you want to do don't talk about how bad the orange guy is tell me what you want to do and don't use woke lingo don't you [\\xa0__\\xa0] do it don't you do it tell me tell me for real don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] me tell me what you can do to fix this right just that tell me you want to bring everybody together just that everybody rightwing left you got to make concessions we got to figure out like where we meet in the middle there's much more that we agree with than we don't agree much more let's concentrate on that stuff and let's be nice about this other [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah that's right that's it that's look it sound like you know what you're saying it it's beautiful and the what's one of the qualities that's beautiful about is is simple that I when I saw I got to see the dolly llama speak once and it's like wow you in person no at a at a he was at a like an event right but you were in the audience yeah I was in the audience so he was there he was there with his translator it was beautiful man real like the vibe in the in the room was so sweet and like you know to go back to what we were talking about earlier some people will tell you a stupid thing like a thing on the side of a cal box like uh I apologize for that be kinder for oh I'm so sorry but you know I could tell you Joe you know what the world needs love and it's I do like cliches though sometimes sometimes they're accurate depend on who it's coming who the cliche is coming from right if they're sincere so the doy Lama is on stage and he says you can always be kinder and it was like you could feel this wave rushing out of him I mean it was like the essence of Buddhism just rushing out everyone simultaneously thinking like yeah he's right and it transcends politics geopolitics and and that that is why what you're saying is so beautiful because it's the same thing which is like you know like this planet we're so lucky to be on a planet going that fast and and and and like we're so lucky to to get a chance a little peephole into time we're not here that long I think this Co thing gives us an opportunity to realize how lucky we really are I do too I do for the people that are struggling right now financially or struggling with their health it doesn't you know doesn't register with you I'm and I'm sorry about that but I think for the people that aren't [\\xa0__\\xa0] by this there is a moment where we get to realize like oh okay we were uh taking this for granted we thought we had all this thing wired in we didn't have it wired I mean they got rid of the Senate what what was the the pandemic there was a pan the White House decided like a year before Corona decided to get rid of the pandemic what was a response what was the actual no like he got the whole based on it they they they dissolved it just imagine imagine if like there's an asteroid like well when's it coming 40 years fire everybody fire everyone we're [\\xa0__\\xa0] we're [\\xa0__\\xa0] just fire everybody the more tests the more sick people we have stop the test just Fu they did that for real know I know I know they so so from that what did they teach us they taught us that we have to depend on each other right now not the state well I think they should give people the opportunity to do what they want to do I really I say this too much I say it at almost every show but you can't tell people they can't work it doesn't make any sense you should you're not smart enough for you to say that you that the only thing that matters is whether or not these people expose themselves to the virus at this point I think that's ridiculous but can I tell you the problem I'm sorry I'm sorry to cut you off but they have to acknowledge that something else matters they have to acknowledge that the financial problems that people are going through are almost unsurmountable they have to acknowledge that and that that destroys a lot of people that creates a lot of depression creates a lot of suicide creates a lot of drug abuse creates a lot of turmoil and a lot of mental health issues that's a fact true so we we're we're taking away people's sovereignty look man if you want to that was another great American tradition if you want to kill yourself well you can do it with so many other ways you're welcome to kill yourself go BMX flipping nobody's going to stop you from doing flips with your motorbike that was the whole point I mean that's like remember when everything got safe like the whole point there was a time when everything was like Al Gonzo and the problem is you're spreading it right so it's not just you and your motorbike it's you crashing your motorbike into a crowd that that's one of the problems there's a lot of that's a good way of looking at it honestly yeah but the bigger to me the bigger that is a problem and it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] the bigger problem is okay so you own an Applebees or whatever right and suddenly the government's like okay everyone can go back to work but no one solve the problem you the owner of the Applebee's calls the the general manager like hey dude get the waiters weight staff back we're open it up you're not going to be there you're going to have the general manager come in and you're going to have the weight staff come in now the weight staff have been living off of unemployment benefits supplied by the federal government that sometimes are more than like what they were making at the place that's not a bad thing but all of a sudden what happened is prior to a true reduction of this pandemic that can kill you most of the time it doesn't but you might be the one who steps in the landmine all of a sudden they just decided Well we got the the economy needs to work so now your unemployment benefits get cut off and you have to go back to work but they haven't solved the problem yet so you become the the the person who has to Bear the weight of the failed uh approach to the disease and that's why it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up to s yes you're right man my friend runs the new California Barber Shop in Echo Park Brian he's one of my be he started off as my barber he became my best friend he's one of the the coolest people I know and like I like it like one of the reasons I want to leave La is cuz that shop can't open that's where I used to go to get my beard trimmed in my ha but it wasn't just that it was it's a real barber shop and it was you have these great conversations you beat people he like he's like gotten me like he's gotten me into a sublet that I once when I needed to be in La for a little bit one of the sad things about being bald I never really developed the relationship with the barber shop and by the time I shaved it my head it was too late that's a good thing to do you can get like a nice straight razor shape yeah you know there's you don't go to a bar something about that right it's like for girl with girls it's acknowledged that a lot of ladies like beauty salons they like to get their nails done they like to get their pedicures they enjoy it yeah I really like yeah like that's all been shut down here right right and like it sucks because that that I I loved going there and it's like but you know the the the thing is like a lot of people it's not time to go back to work because if there is a true risk that from making minimum wage you're going to get a disease that probably won't kill you cuz you're a waiter Applebee's you're probably going to be okay you're taking your vitamins but you might be living with your aunt who has Alzheimer's disease and you're going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] kill her because you picked up a little bit of it and the reason you're going to kill her is because you had to go back to work because your benefits got cut off so it's like this is the this is why it's a very complex [\\xa0__\\xa0] up problem that really we we it's like yes do for me a person who I'm doing great do I I want everything open I want to go to guitar guitar center is open but I don't want to stand in line I want to go into guitar I want everything to be the way it was I'm probably going to be okay but this is again it's like this is a complex problem I don't buy into the idea that the whole thing's a scam I think we've got exactly what that [\\xa0__\\xa0] not why did I say [\\xa0__\\xa0] too much boo that a do he was actually the opposite of an [\\xa0__\\xa0] on your show I'm like calling a doctor an [\\xa0__\\xa0] Remember The Joe Rogan questions everything the theologist who told us there's going to be another great pandemic six years well we should I've talked about this before but we should tell people Duncan and I were in Galveston Texas and we went to the Center for Disease Control and went to the very place where they experiment on Ebola and all these crazy diseases that kill you instantly and Duncan and I were in this building and we were watching like we watch through a window that takes you there's like another window behind that that's like this plexiglass sealed room and they have like space suits on and tubes and I'm like hold on hold on so there's some [\\xa0__\\xa0] in there that can kill everybody like 100% And like it's right there and they were doing tests on it and so these people are wearing like space suits and they're walking around with these horrific World killing diseases yeah man and remember we missed the flight yeah we did we missed the flight we had to get there we were just high as [\\xa0__\\xa0] at the airport talking and the flight the flight took off dunan and I lost total track of time we were barbecued we did we take edibles dude I don't remember we did something we were so high we might have took Ed we might have took my my custom is to take an edible in the car my custom that's because it takes time to get to the airport and by the time you get to the airport the absurdity of it all just kicks in in Full Steam cuz it's like I have no control at the airport the airport is a place where you just want to give up complete control and when you're super duper duper High that's a fun ride you know so you and I were just sitting down talking about life and that plane went we're like where's the plane like the plane left like what we didn't just miss the plane by like 10 minutes like 40 minutes it was the ultimate dumb Stoner Moment Like if we weren't on our way to film a television show we would have looked like the biggest losers we looked like losers anyway but but we had fun and we took one in the morning and we got there with very little sleep we made it but being in like the Galveston Texas Centers for Disease Control with like very this is different this is the um this is dunan this is Duncan went to some Preppers this is one that I really Lov cuz I didn't get a chance to be with you so I got to watch it you know like from the clips and see what it was like when you went didn't you get to be that one I was doing something else we were trying to film two things at the same time I think that time you know what man I was really like not annoyed but like because I love doing the show but I'm like of course he doesn't show up to this [\\xa0__\\xa0] cuz like suddenly I end up deep in a I'm deep in a cave would have totally done it but I think it was when like there was a bunch of things that we were trying to film and we were short on time so we couldn't do things together but remember we did this Skinwalker Ranch one together you were so pissed he was so fake oh there was the problem was when we got there right when we got there we heard this Preposterous story from this person who threw a cigarette on the ground after that's what set you off 100% yeah cuz I'm like this is a [\\xa0__\\xa0] he threw a cigarette on the ground in the forest this is a [\\xa0__\\xa0] like we drove here for and he's lying we we're here with a [\\xa0__\\xa0] who's lying I'm like oh great great I actually asked him to pick it up I'm like come on man I remember that moment dude and it but that to me it's like you can't it's beautiful Utah Forest you smoke a cigarette and you throw it down you step on it like you're not my kind of person Joe here's the reason you're so American you really do believe in a utopian ideal and Joe Rogan questions everything for real both of us this is what I realized ye years after we both had a sense in our heart that we might really find proof of something big and we went into it with that attitude we did but we were so high we believe what we were saying dude that's the funniest thing about it it's like you know most people when they do these shows they're not going into it thinking like I'm actually going to uncover something yeah of course they don't go into it thinking they're going to un cover something they go into it thinking this is all a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] and I'm going to do so I'm going to be like or maybe they think maybe it's real or whatever but the main thing is they they don't they talk they they pretend it's real that's the thing they it's real T it's real and we also went into it like two guys who are more High during a show you will not find yeah it's true you will not find theti let me barbecued looking for bigfoot I mean dude I was barbecu we were so high dude and this guy we don't need to blow this guy's spot up he's poor fell look at me my hipst are face oh boy listen people love maybe he believes what he's saying maybe maybe all that stuff that they were telling us they really truly believe but they were talking about like bulletproof wolves that appear out of mist and all this stuff to me that moment was when the show went South and what was really funny was like this the last thing the Sci-Fi Network wanted was for you to like actually like begin to like realize that maybe we're not going to find UFOs and they started getting unhappy I think with the situation oh they did get unhappy there was actually a conversation when they're like is he trying to debunk these things cuz they have all these shows on like UFOs and all these show on ghosts and then they have this comedian [\\xa0__\\xa0] with his [\\xa0__\\xa0] buddy and they're both high as [\\xa0__\\xa0] and they're like this is so fake like this is so but we wanted to know we wanted to know we wanted to know if it was real or if it was fake remember the alien artifacts part do you remember that part there was someone who collected all these alien little bits of dust and metal you don't remember it probably I remember that because I was already given up on that point I noticed a p unfortunately and I feel real bad but it was it was really a personal thing because I was dealing with my own nonsense my own incv my own inclination to uh believe ridiculous stories even today like with the Pentagon story about them having recovered uh a craft not made from this world like please don't let it be a misquote I don't want to I don't want to read the misquote man I don't so I know that there's a real pull to believing in [\\xa0__\\xa0] there's a real pull to like manipulating the actual facts of Roswell so that it appears the government absolutely 100% colluded to keep the alien crash from the general public and there's no way it could be a weather balloon I don't know if that's right man because I know it in myself because I see it in myself I see that dirty little [\\xa0__\\xa0] that wants to believe in Bigfoot that stupid [\\xa0__\\xa0] they're like hey hey hey maybe it's a bear maybe it's not a lost monkey species but I want to believe so bad so I don't think that's a dirty [\\xa0__\\xa0] but this is me this is me I've worked on this right this is something that I've spent a lot of time thinking about there's a lot of people out there that just lie they're not thinking about anything but they the same way they want to believe too they want to believe in UFOs they want to believe in Bigfoot they want to believe in all these things they want to believe yeah and it's not their fault they this is they grew up in a [\\xa0__\\xa0] up town and their their friends were probably all drunk by the time they were four and the whole thing's a mess and here they are stuck in this situation where they're just making [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and here you and I are standing there going I don't think this guy ever really was kidnapped by Bigfoot and we we get to hear these ridiculous stories and there was too many of them man we everybody we talked to had this I I like real obvious psychological like Bend to them there was always like everyone and no one had a steady chassis no one who you were talking to right yes remember the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Bigfoot guy that said he would chop his pinky off to find out if Bigfoot was real he was a professor he was a professor I forget we had him on the podcast we we had the foot the footprint seeing Dr M Dr meler right M Meldrum yes thank you Jamie's the wizard Dr Meldrum Dr Meldrum he said he would cut his finger off to find out if Bigfoot was real would you cut your finger off to find no I don't care listen I hope it's not real I hope it's it's real I don't care either one would be awesome what data set would you cut your finger off I would cut my finger off to know if there was a a intelligent design to Creation on Earth I would give them my the very tip of my pinky for that but then what happens then you run around with this information you can't share with anybody and you're freaked out all day well no then I try to contact that thing in a more intense way I mean like the the P the tip of the pink is not a bad thing to get rid of yeah for like knowing knowing like whether there's like again you have to like so weak first of all what what kind of computer are you working with that you're going to have to take your pinky and like drop it in to get truth out of it it's a stupid computer you shouldn't trust it if you ever want to feel what it's like to to be like three again make your thumb wrestle your pinky your pinky is like [\\xa0__\\xa0] you have no power in your pinky your pinky is so weak that's what it's like to be like a three-year-old straining against your older brother get off me get off me [\\xa0__\\xa0] you got a pinky that's right this a what a [\\xa0__\\xa0] little digit what does that thing get used for just what does it get used for again I dislocated both of them you dislocated them you're pinky they don't match up oh dude oh damn oh that's weird so one oh B oh that makes s and all sorts of sh you use it for holding wine you need it to like extend when you're drinking yes look man very important I think that out don't you like I heard my pinky doing that wrestling with my thumb like legitimately it hurts now it's so weak it's so weak I but I do so much with my hands so many chinups there's some reason for it so many kettle bell grips and it's mostly these other fingers even when you draw back a a bow my bow my uh my release doesn't even have a pinky thing I draw back with these fingers this [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass just hangs around for the ride you're so mean to your pinky why do you do that I love my pinkies I love them they're great I don't want them miss them but think of the name itself it's like it's weird how weak it is compared to all the other digits you have and they named it a pinky like the whole thing is like mess the whole thing does sound like it's it is a a very like we the name pinky itself is like you know I will [\\xa0__\\xa0] you up with this finger this finger right here is strong as [\\xa0__\\xa0] this finger gets a hold of [\\xa0__\\xa0] this is a strong finger this is a [\\xa0__\\xa0] finger that's not hurting anybody they're all on the same hand it listen everyone belongs on the hand like we have to forget the pinky if you were as strong physically as your small toe wow that's crazy that's life just everything can [\\xa0__\\xa0] you up every pebble is murderous every jumping upstairs the wrong way you stub your toe you want to die if you that's who you are you are as strong as your little baby toe your little baby toe has zero power grab your little baby toe and like wrestle with it real quick it has nothing a it's a baby yeah they call it a baby toe cuz it's like a it's not babies are stronger than your baby toe yeah yeah well look a [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass little limb that's yeah that would that's the funny thing about the human sentient projection into time is like we're probably like the little toe of the universe you know like we have just enough realization to know that we're something we're this hilarious intersection of like you know meat and what appear like a real feeling of like you know I do feel like uh bias aside if there isn't a part of you that hasn't like really come to the conclusion that there seems to be a part of you that doesn't get touched by reality the some Eternal part of you that has met time and space uh I I I feel like most people get that sense kids feel that they they know that they just actually know it but you know to me I think maybe what we are in this little temporary whatever it may be whether it's an aquarium whether it's a training facility I think it's probably a training facility you know like I don't think it's that I think it's a process and I think the process has to be tumultuous CU if it's not nothing gets done I think the struggles have to exist because if there's only Harmony and peace everybody gets stagnant I think right there's there's a steady push towards ultimate technological innovation that's the steadiest push if you look at the human race in terms of like what it makes like what does it do at the end of the day if you have these bees and they have all this different thing all these different social things they do and all these different things they do for covering territory and ground and all these different aspects of being a bee and laying the larvae inside the honeycomb but what do they do what do they they make honey [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's what they do they make honey what do we do we make robots we make computers we make technology and we make it better every [\\xa0__\\xa0] year we don't make better laws every year like no no no we don't revise that [\\xa0__\\xa0] we got stuff written with [\\xa0__\\xa0] ink from charcoal you know [\\xa0__\\xa0] like in the archive somewhere what we do is we make better [\\xa0__\\xa0] every year we make better [\\xa0__\\xa0] and our goal is just keep making better [\\xa0__\\xa0] and I'm obsessed with better [\\xa0__\\xa0] I'm obsessed with like cell phones and I'm obsessed I love like unbox therapy or um any any of those shows Marcus brownley when they doing these unbox videos and talking about the newest latest and greatest technology and they're showing these 120 HZ screens and these [\\xa0__\\xa0] cameras with 100x optical zoom like amazing but what are we doing we're moving ourselves closer and closer to some kind of technological superiority and along the way we're losing our humanity and that's the weirdest most ironic part of it along the way of we we've never been in a a greater technological era if you look in terms of the things that are consumer electronics that get released right now whether it's laptops or iPhones or you know Samsung Note 20s or whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] they are these things are insane right never been in a time like this before this is like this is peaked also when have we ever had a time where there's riots in every city every city all across the country and it's all a lot of it is things that most people agree with right you say especially if you say something like black lives matter I want let's have a vote how many people don't agree with that statement just forget about what the this everybody want oh it's a Marxist thing and these people they they want to destroy the nuclear family I don't know if they do or they don't but most people I bet who are who are a part of that movement don't even know what that means they don't know all that [\\xa0__\\xa0] they just don't want people to get killed by cops that's it that's it and it's not like Michael Chay has a great bit about it where it says like that's not even asking a lot like matters like black lives matter just matters like and people like man I don't know it's this is the strangest time for us socially because of covid this is the strangest time because of the economy the strangest time because Trump is President and there's chaos and the guy who's running against him is older than him and you're like this is madness like what is what is happening here and no one knows when the [\\xa0__\\xa0] people are going to be able to go back to work and there's all this chaos and all this anxiety it's all happening together at once I know man I know that's what this is you know this is what I love like I I work my medit I work with a meditation teacher David nickar he's he's brilliant and one of the things he tells me and I really this is an example of how cool he is this is when all the New York Times [\\xa0__\\xa0] came out about the aliens I call him I'm like David New York Times aliens and he's like wow wow and then his response was Duncan where do you think thoughts come from do you think they are born from something that was his response to me telling about aliens was a question where do you think thoughts come from are thoughts like born like the way well it's a good question it's a great question I still haven't figured it out but I've asked if ideas were aliens I think that if you think about a cell phone right I mean obviously there's a collaborative effort involving a lot of people that understand all sorts of different aspects of Technology But ultimately it has to be an idea someone has to have the idea to come up the original Motorola phone the [\\xa0__\\xa0] brick and then they had the idea to innovate and keep getting better and better and these ideas eventually lead to this thing that can open your car door turn your lights on your house you can FaceTime your kids it's a crazy crazy crazy thing and it's all coming out of ideas where do they come from that's the question the question is is it an an inherent part of being a human being because like all other aspects of human beings we are not a single organism we are a a biosphere the human organism is essentially an ecosystem the human organism has Untold trillions of of of bacteria in our gut right we have it on our skin we have all sorts of weird life forms that we live synergistically in this space as a person why wouldn't we think ideas would be a part of that yeah right they might very well be a part of that and the healthier your mind is the more you're able to live with ideas the more you're able to bounce ideas around like ideas as a life form just like the health like if you use antibacterial soap all over your body all the time you get sick right you get [\\xa0__\\xa0] rashes and [\\xa0__\\xa0] because your body it kills all the good bacteria too yeah it's like man I I the I loved the question because like one of my favorite acid trips was I was like listening to Beethoven oh wow oh man and I like I like some I don't know how it happened but like I was like I I like had a little like a this beautiful girl she was so beautiful and like I was at her house we're listening to Beethoven I was tripping and I started thinking and it was just like romantic and cool and then but then I started thinking like somebody thought of this and then I started thinking but where did it where did it come from like if they thought of it what was it before they thought of it like this didn't exist before Beethoven yeah so where was it and and I remember that as I was like thinking that on on the best still to this day the best acid I ever had what's the difference I'm not much of an acid connoisseur what's the difference between really good acid and mediocre acid it apparently it has something to do with a mechanism of production right the way it's yeah yeah which is like listen to like kid Charlamagne by Steely Dan it's all about uh it's all about one of the great uh Oley one of the great LSD kist of our time uh who and I met his wife and I asked her this question like why is some why is acid not as good as it used to be in the 60s and her response was people aren't perfectionists anymore honey that was literally there we will sell no wine before it's time yeah it was like I don't I don't I don't know but well that's you mean that's a thing that we want with whiskey like that's one of the things about Buffalo Trace who bottles this stuff yeah they uh they taste everything they taste and if it's not good they don't they're connoisseurs so that we want so I understand that you would want that with acid the problem is that acid's illegal that's the real problem the problem is have some [\\xa0__\\xa0] space Daddy some dude who's at the the top of the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Helm of this spaceship as it hurls through Infinity Dy they they don't want you they have to be space daddy if it's the president of the United States that's space daddy right the president of the United States is space Daddy he is the [\\xa0__\\xa0] leader of the the greatest army the world's ever known he's at the Helm of the global Empire he that's space Daddy and he's we're going through space so if we are a spaceship the president of the United States is space Dy Captain Kirk he has to be right yeah yeah well it's not the space daddy that's made LSD illegal what's made LSD illegal was an earlier space daddy 1970 space Daddy they tried to disband the Civil Rights Movement Yeah by making drugs like all schedule one drugs yeah that space daddy did it but but good the good news is like uh they're they're at least at the very least they're they're letting people like look at how what it is and like how it affects the brain and they're beginning to understand that there like everything we all knew there's no point getting resentful about it but we all knew this we all knew this and but we're all like it's being validated thank God and it's very sweet because it's a it's a healing drug especially when used in and with therapy you know and uh it's healing it's a very powerful beautiful wonderful thing that exists on the planet that anyone could have access to especially if they like stop this ridiculous prohibition and and and lifted the prohibition I'm not saying like don't prohibit heroin prohibit heroin prohibit methamphetamin but even even any prohibition the the problem is I don't want anybody doing it but I shouldn't be able to tell you not to that's the problem that really is the problem the problem is I shouldn't be able to tell you not to that's right and and certainly like because it's too slippery but you shouldn't be able to like there shouldn't be a fiveyear mandatory minimum for LSD I mean that's Madness no that's Madness and it and it really does heal people it's a healing look you do your own like your research look into it have you read chaos the Tom O'Neal book no oh my god dude one of my favorite podcasts over the last year I did was with Tom O'Neal and he's Greg Fitz Simmons's neighbor he was Greg fit Simmons's neighbor for like 20 years in Venice and the whole time he was Greg's neighbor he was working on this book Now Greg never brings someone to me never never says dude you got to have this guy on a as a guest ever so out of all these years Greg's like dude this guy you need to have on this guy researched Charles Manson for 20 [\\xa0__\\xa0] years he was originally just writing an article he was writing an article but as he's writing this article he starts uncovering more and more crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] and he goes deeper and deeper into this war 20 [\\xa0__\\xa0] years later he finally puts out this book and this book is basically detailing a CIA LSD operation where Charles Manson was getting dosed in prison allegedly and there was he was being treated at this free clinic in Hay Ashbury that ran for more than 50 years and closed 3 months after the book was released they ran this [\\xa0__\\xa0] free clinic where they were dosing hippies and they were testing them they ran operation midnight climax it was all part of MK Ultra he's detailing step by step all these people that were directly involved in not just Charles Manson but in [\\xa0__\\xa0] Jack Ruby and all these other political figures in history and it's like what in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] all these mind control C A LSD experiments that were real and Charles Manson was a part of that allegedly and Charles Manson was dosing up these hippies and not taking it himself he was using the techniques that they allegedly used on him for like seven years while he was in federal penitenti what a mess this is the problem with like anytime power you got to read this book man I look I've look I've read a lot about the M this one crazy this one's different it's just specifically what they did to allow Manson to run free and build these murderous hippies and get them high on LSD this was all a part of this thing to sort of demonize the anti-war movement there was all these different strategies the an M yeah cuz you take LSD and War seems ridiculous you take LSD and money seems ridiculous you take LSD and anything that doesn't have to do with love seems insane and the problem is is like you know and this is you know all the Psychedelic [\\xa0__\\xa0] aside if you just look at like basic Buddhism 101 I was in some of the prior to this pandemic my favorite conversations were in Uber man and I'm writing this Uber and this Uber driver who's clearly a Buddhist he's got a Buddhist a Buddhist statue on his like dashboard and like so we started talking about Buddhism and we're talking about it and he said the coolest thing I've ever heard regarding Buddhism which is he's like do you know how you look at letters and they you think that they're a language what are you before that it's so cool holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah yeah thank God there's people like that in the world I know well that's a true Buddhist that's a true missionary but but in that in LSD will return you to that state so it will drop you under all of your apps that are running on the operating system of your Consciousness for a little bit some people hate that because they've like so identified with the apps that the moment they can't like cling to the app that they become this like you know thing before the language which is why some people on a lot of asset can't even they can't talk they talk like babies yeah but but what's happening is you're encountering like original sentients prior to conditioning and that's dangerous to uh um any kind of power structure like if I'm trying to implement a hierarchy I depend on your Consciousness flowing into these rivulets that are language morality ethics the entire structure of whatever I'm like trying to like tell you is the way things are and if I can do that then I can own you because suddenly your morality isn't real morality your ethics aren't real ethics your idea of what's right isn't necessarily what's right it's what's right for capitalism what's right for communism what's right for this or that if I can tell you if I can make your moral compass point away from service in any way shape or form I can control you forever and so anything that gets in the way of that is really like generally like delegitimate I by power structures I mean it makes sense well the problem is you're dealing with we there's a a combination of morality and a game and the game is trying to make money like when you have numbers you know I'm reading this book right now I'm listening to it on tape um it's called Uh irresistible and I keep forgetting this dude's name who uh who wrote the book but I'm listening to it on audio book it's uh Adam alter and it's all about addictions and it's all about particularly how addictive games are insanely addictive like games like Tetris and Candy Crush insanely addictive where they've made billions and billions of dollars on Candy Crush it's crazy people can't put it down like Farmland made [\\xa0__\\xa0] unbelievable amounts of money There's Something About Numbers like you see you look at your bank account you go I've got $155,000 in the bank I can't believe this that's pretty [\\xa0__\\xa0] good I remember when I was broke and then you go you know what it would be great if I had 50 I'd just like to get 20 this year I'm just going to cut back on going out to eat I'm going to do that I'm going to put five away and then you're like you know what I need to make more that's what I need to do I need to make more money I want to put in some overtime I'm G to talk to the boss I'm gonna lick I'm dedicated I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] a lot of people get tired I don't get tired dude I am dedicated to this [\\xa0__\\xa0] job and I want to move up in this company and the boss is like yes come on aboard slave man you're going to work for the corporation 18 hours a day great you're you're you're getting paid well don't get me wrong you're not really a slave but what you are is a slave to your own idea of what success is you got you're a slave to these the idea that numbers equate success yeah you don't notice man you don't notice you don't notice you get used to everywhere you live it's nice if you live in a place that's safe after that you I'm telling you you don't notice you know what you notice you notice when your friends are around you and you're enjoying each other's company and you're laughing and having fun you notice those things you notice if you do something and people enjoy it you notice if you you have a good interaction action with someone at a store like they go no you and then you go no you and then you're both smiling and laughing and everybody's you're you're having that's those are nice moments man we have those we still have those like you let somebody in front of you and they give you the PE on you give them the thumbs up and these moments are still here man they're more than they're not it's not like everybody just stabbing everybody everywhere you look most of the interactions that people have with each other all over the place are positive that's right it's a very small amount the problem is these small amounts making on [\\xa0__\\xa0] YouTube and then that's all I can watch there you go I just watch these [\\xa0__\\xa0] people in Portland beat the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of each other and kick some guy in the head when he's sitting on his he's sitting down when he apparently drove too close to these antifa guys and they made him get out of the car and they're searching his belongings this guy runs up behind him and kicks him in the head and knocks him unconscious horrible and I'm like God damn it but it's not most people most of the time and the problem is that's what everybody's going to pay attention to that's what everybody's going to share on Facebook and Instagram I saw that [\\xa0__\\xa0] video video in my timeline like 30 times but this is what I love about humanity is like if you strip away the story and you see a person getting kicked in the head honestly man like I don't care like in general like I don't care what that guy is don't kick him in the head here's the problem dude is a natural inclination to want to fight the opposite of your tribe yeah and when you're 16 years old or however old that kid well the kid who kicked that guy in the head he looked young to me I could have easily done that when I was 16 easily I was so dumb if I was in the streets at 16 he was Dumb and we pulled some guy out of his car that someone said tried to run us over and the guy's sitting there easily me or any of the people I hung out with would have punched that guy or kicked that guy that's the compassion that's normal it's normal the problem is the tribal war that we have going on that's the problem that's but what you just said that's the truth that's the truth and it's compassionate this this is a stupid kid he was a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I think he worked at the airport whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] he was this is a stupid kid and and and what he did is wrong he got caught up in the wave of violence the mob mentality it's normal we have to figure out listen man here here's the thing we must discover you're not first of all you're not going to find this on the map I like going off the map but there's not a map for this so that's deliberating to me we got to get off the map number one we got to get off the map like first everyone this is what's so crazy people are really legitimately tuning into like the like human trafficking in the United States it's a big business it's one of the biggest businesses actually human trafficking yeah I was reading a post today that somebody sent me and I don't know if it's verified or real or whatever where a girl was saying that she was headed to a a bathroom at a uh gas station somewhere and uh someone she noticed that someone was had their camera turned around so they like had the selfie camera on where they're on FaceTime and they pointed to this lady and they said what about her she she heard her say what about her do you like her and the girl looked at them and and the lady turned and looked at her and she ran back to her car got in their car and the guy who was with them went and ran up to the side of the car like she thinks they were trying to kidnap her 100% they were and that that happens that happens that happens that's a real business this is not like this is not a a [\\xa0__\\xa0] story this is not a magazine article where people are you know someone wrote some fiction this is right and the funny thing not funny but what what's ironic about the sudden horror at human trafficking is a lot of the very same people who are fighting against this thing that they're they're realizing is happening in the country simultaneously don't want to look back into the history of the United States which was 100% based on human trafficking 100% our country 's Foundation is human trafficking they [\\xa0__\\xa0] kidnapped black people and made them work for free and somewhere in between that horror and now people have gotten this delusion that that stopped it didn't stop our country is was literally founded George Washington did you know this was the number one slave holder in uh Virginia wherever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] he was he was the number one slave supposedly his wooden teeth thing it was slave teeth yeah he was the number one slaveholder did he have wooden gums is that what it was I don't the whole wooden tee thing was a replacement of the truth which is this [\\xa0__\\xa0] was a human trafficker so people try to like they try to revise so the idea is like you know let's look at this look at this Washington's Dentures were likely sourced from the teeth of slaves sourced there you go they're going to say sourced that wasn't sourc they were ripped out of the [\\xa0__\\xa0] mouth of human hostages don't say sourced I Source avocados to my [\\xa0__\\xa0] Mexican restaurant I don't Source teeth [\\xa0__\\xa0] why would you use that language why would you use that language yeah it's not Source go back to that Jamie can I read the rest of it um records at Mount Vernon show that he bought teeth from slaves bought them but that's Records who knows if the slaves actually got the money the poor enslaved had been selling teeth as a means of making money since the Middle Ages which were sold Dentures or implants to those of financial means either way man so so you know Jeffrey Epstein J Jeffrey Epstein Source teeth from some of the young girls he was [\\xa0__\\xa0] and it was actually common for the young girls to sell their teeth for money like it's it that that right there that right there is the root of the [\\xa0__\\xa0] problem which is like this country George Washington was a human trafficker who had in his mouth the teeth of people that were kidnapped he was making work for free this makes dmer look like a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Boy Scout can you imagine if look at this quote according to George Washington's Ledger on May 8th 1784 he paid 62 shillings to Negroes for nine teeth on account of Dr Le Moine so he paid six pounds two Shillings I don't know how much that is who cares for nine teeth so this says does this say he's paying it to the slaves it actually says they don't know if they were slaves or not probably paid it to the doctor to extract it Jesus Christ but it wasn't what but so there were free black men that lived in America but how what was the percentage versus slaves and free men who cares the main thing is this [\\xa0__\\xa0] who's in statues everywhere was a kidnapper who like took teeth out of people's mouths and put it in his own mouth that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and so like Well everybody's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up in our all of our all of our holidays like Columbus was one of the worst people of all time yeah so this whole like when people are defending the statues it's like shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up but here's the thing man should you allow people to just pull down the statues really yep what do you think because do you think here's what I think what if there were Jeffrey dmer statues all over La no you make a good point but what maybe we should educate people on why you feel so strongly about like the George Washington statute or even the Thomas Jefferson statue a lot of people are arguing that Thomas Jefferson that you know he he's a piece of [\\xa0__\\xa0] and we shouldn't respect him either how do you do you think that all those statues should come down or do you think it's more of an imperative for us to understand that in the world of 1776 or in the world of whenever when did Washington get here what was George Washington's first years in America I'm not in any way shape or form giving anyone a free pass on owning slaves I don't think anybody that that's all what I'm saying anybody who thinks that about but what I am saying is I think human beings up until he was born in Virginia oh he was born in America George Wasington one of the first Real Americans Jeffrey D one of [\\xa0__\\xa0] it I'm getting a George Washington tattoo Joe I'm in I'm in what's wrong with you he's American no look can I the statue question this is what I think okay either take the statue down or put around it the number of slaves he had build statues for all the slaves he had so if George Washington had 4,000 slaves there needs to be a field of slave statues around the George Washington statue that you have to walk through to get to to the George Washington statue or just pull it down CU you know what it's easier to pull it down no no no no no you're right though have the slaves and have some of them missing teeth because they sold it to him because they need we'd have to find out if you really bought teeth from slaves or if it's just regular folks needed money just have the whole story there like that's all just have the whole story so people realize what's what you're saying is perfect like if you're going to have a guy who victimized I mean everybody did it back then everybody of wealth did it it was a normal thing to do to have people that you owned as crazy as that sounds to us dude I think that the world before mass communication before the post office and certainly before any kind of uh boat travel when when everyone was just either on foot or on horses was [Music] undeniably impossible for us to understand because they were so Savage there was very few rules people were just dying of syphilis and every other [\\xa0__\\xa0] disease that came around the bend whether it was the flu or the plague there was no sanitation everyone was a rapist it was just a a a a wild barely human thing that occasionally paint cool things and write things down and compose music but lived in a Savage environment that's almost unrecognizable for us today I don't look I and again man like I'm presenting a Counterpoint to you that I I don't want people to pray upon me for the Counterpoint saying oh woke Doug it had a baby got all woke but like but I do want to present a CounterPoint in the in in with the intention of like let's look at like that the maybe that is actually part of the conditioning which is like if if like so if your country is based on human trafficking which to this day is happening well this country is based on human trafficking this country is based on and it's also based on human sacrifice in the it's also based on us killing the people that were here first that's right and we've been at War for 92% of our history and many of those Wars are based on nothing so you know people are up in arms about the Bohemian Grove but it's like give me a [\\xa0__\\xa0] break look atam that's human sacrifice there was money to be made from killing people and they made money so we have a country that's based on human trafficking and Human Sacrifice nobody wants to talk about it the idea is the exact same thing that all abusers do to people they've abused they want you to number one forget it and if you start remembering it they tell you you're crazy or that you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] up so the idea is that like the world prior to the United States was a Savage World Savage Africa was not Savage these were very Advanced people but because like the Europeans were were Savage we brutal people they went in there and [\\xa0__\\xa0] just started chopping people up these are people who had a natural innate trust for other humans and they were like put your hand out slap go get some gold or I'll cut your other one off that's what they did when they came here to North America right it was Hills Have Eyes level so The Hills Have Eyes roll into all indigenous cultures they're in tuned with the earth when [\\xa0__\\xa0] gets weird they move look I'm not but but here's the thing I've been spending the last six months deeply engrossed in Native American books and they weren't that nice not at all dude they ate each other the Nez purse were like practicing cannibals yeah the nzp Indians were practicing cannibals listen man the commes killed everybody they were bral they killed everybody they killed each other they killed Native Americans they would their main thing was raiding they'd raid tribes and steal and kill and murder and rape the idea I've heard and this may not be I I didn't look into it and I I apologize to the people who told me about this idea because I wish i' I'd researched it more but I'm going to put it out there is that Africa was a was a really ancient culture that was dude Africa is where Egypt is EXA that's people don't recognize people were sending people there to get educated before slavery even started before they burned the Library of Alexandria that was the place where everybody would go to learn things yes and so we [\\xa0__\\xa0] went in there and just re Havoc not us it wasn't us we can't say we I'm sorry from North Carolina love that I burped right I was born in New Jersey we can't say we we made you made a very profound point and I burped no but we didn't do it no I don't I don't I don't mean we I don't mean we and I'm not saying like I'm directly connected I'm just saying like for me it's like the anytime I get around any situation where someone is making it so I can't say the truth right I get really annoyed yes yes which is why you're comic it freaks me out yes and it freaks me out and so the reason that the whole like the whatever the particular movement is like when Trump is it like the Mount Rushmore and that's Lota right that's like sacred land that's like sacred land but like they went in there and they chopped up a mountain with a bunch of SLA like slave owner faces and Trump's like it's the best mountain on Earth it's like it look better before you put the human traffickers on it right how about the [\\xa0__\\xa0] hilarity of him suggesting that his face should be on it just to R people up yeah there's some part of you as a comic that has to appreciate that I'm sorry Joe I'm going to admit that's true when I when I when I saw that he was suggesting that his name should be on Mount Everest I or not at Mount Everest Mount Rushmore I was I was thinking immediately like oh my God he's he's he's moving them into Checkmate dude look at my [\\xa0__\\xa0] Twitter I've been like seven different personalities designed to rile people up over the last month that's all you do with this q and on thing Jamie was hoping you would come in as your q and on character it's fine look no but like does that should that person be president no but listen but that's hilarious when in this madness with all this crazy there's no such thing as gender world for a guy to come around and say I'm going to put my face on Mount Rushmore like this this part of that that I like well listen I'm to be honest I'm not a fan of his lack of empathy that's what beautiful that's what's beautiful about you is you're not afraid to admit something that I think is really important to admit which is like dude there are like there are there's a Continuum of reality and there's swaths of that Continuum that are amazing like I don't know if you've ever been in in a situation where like maybe you're in a kind of like relationship that's not great but there's a piece of that relationship that is so [\\xa0__\\xa0] hot and so sexy and so beautiful in the midst of all the madness that it almost like makes the madness makes sense right that's a that's a or or certainly like there's certain like sub subance as I embibe that if you look at what they do to my body it's like terrible but like that sliver of whatever it is is great so anyway what I love that you're not afraid of doing is like putting out there like look man it's not like people are one thing but here's the thing too I'm not a willing victim of gaslighting you can't you can't do that to me right I'm not interested you know I don't need anything from you I'm not interested in you gaslighting me I know when someone's putting on a show I had an email from a guy who I like who told me to stop talking about Joe Biden because all the problems are because he has a stutter and I'm like listen man when you're 74 or however old he is he's older than that right the wheels come off man on everybody right I I don't feel as sharp at 53 as I did at 33 how about that yeah the reality is there's days if I'm not on top of my [\\xa0__\\xa0] game I get real Spacey yeah what happens in 25 years come on man are we pretending that we live forever you we need young vibrant robust people with a lot of energy who but who are also Advanced thinkers and right now they don't have any one of those people in the race we got craziness in the race well no no you know man like the thing with Biden is like forget about B like the pro like I'm voting for [\\xa0__\\xa0] Biden you going suck my dick I'm voting for Biden do we have to do that are you going to do it anyway not suck your dick and why can't I get a [\\xa0__\\xa0] on top of it seems greedy it would be nice look I'm sorry to be aggressive man this this liquor like it's bringing out something bad that's what I love about whiskey Whiskey's been responsible for some of my favorite conversations look man shout out to Buffalo Trace I like the reality of the situation is like Biden I I don't like his policy regarding drugs and I'm very resentful of a lot of the things he's done and I'm also very resentful of the fact that that that's what I'm like being that's the the binary that I'm being forced to like contend with here that's the resentment right is that we only have these two sanction choices and if you're a good person who doesn't want people to die in the streets you you have to vote blue that's it period that's it in the initial phases of it when I was trying to like I was hoping Bernie would be the [\\xa0__\\xa0] front runner and I'm like I [\\xa0__\\xa0] Bernie up dude Bernie got attached to some jokes what do you mean I Bernie came on my podcast and he I I I did a very lukewarm endorsement of Bernie like I can't do stand up right now so I'll just tell you this Bernie did this very lukewarm I I did a lukew I said I'll probably vote I had my friend Barry Weiss on from The New York Times and she said who are you gonna vote for I said I'll probably vote for Bernie I said he makes sense I like what he stands for the guy's been Rock Solid his whole life he's always believing like we it would be good to have a change where someone gets into office we go this guy really believes in Justice he's not greedy he's not beholding the corporations well they ran with that and then all these people that were in competition with Bernie started pulling [\\xa0__\\xa0] that I've said on the podcast drunk high as [\\xa0__\\xa0] stand up comedy put it in cont put it in in quotes I remember that and uh there was one of them I read this article that was like on a real a real newspaper um where uh in quotes it said he believes that lesbians lack the lower back muscles to [\\xa0__\\xa0] a woman correctly what this is a piece of my act it was a bit it was a bit about a conversation that I had at a bar I was with a friend of mine at a bar and there's this lady who's really aggressive who's making out with her girlfriend and she yells over it at us she goes sorry boys she only likes girls and I got my own dick she says this to us yeah so I go where is it and she goes it's a strap on and I said having a strap on thinking it's a dick is like having a lighter and thinking you're a dragon plus everyone knows that lesbians lack the proper lower black muscles to [\\xa0__\\xa0] a woman correctly it was like I was in this sparring match this verbal sparring match with this crazy lady that's what I said you can't just take that part out and put it in quotes and say what really believe that lesbians lack the proper lower back muscles to be in a loving relationship with another woman who's also a lesbian that's not what I said [\\xa0__\\xa0] I can't trust you on anything how am I going to trust you with Russia or climate change or anything will you lie about jokes right because you they didn't want a guy who wasn't beholden to the system so there was two people that I was interested in Tulsi gabard who's a she's been a congresswoman for six years I love her she's she served overseas twice Rock Solid she's a real leader and they didn't want to have nothing to do with her you know T plant the Hari krishna's sing to good I hope they get in let's give it a chance May they're right they seen those harras I I I I mean I'm like really eating my ass here cuz like there was a period where I'm like you know what [\\xa0__\\xa0] this I'm not going to let the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Democratic party shove this [\\xa0__\\xa0] who's like was like Pro all these what happens if he dies kamla becomes president and then does she have to get a new vice president who does she get as a vice pres to get a vice president she get AOC cuz you don't have to be a certain you don't have to be a certain age to be vice president AOC I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] what anybody says about her she's wonderful I love her she's awesome eat me alive I don't care look at me who cares I I think she's awesome I love her so much and and I'm going to get [\\xa0__\\xa0] for it too but I think the errors that she makes she makes because she has this idea that she's trying to do good I really believe that she's also 30 yeah how [\\xa0__\\xa0] dumb were you when you were 30 you know one of the things about Bridget fety who's hilarious Bridget fety is amazing what what happened here have to be 35 to be vice president just like sorry hang in there in the wings baby will vote for you pick you up in term two I will vote for you I think she's trying to do good but Bridget fety who's one of my favorite people to to talk to she said that when she read a diary that she wrote or a journal that she wrote when she was 24 she's like Jesus Christ I was AOC and now she's like much more of a Centrist in fact like she's like always mocking woke [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know and she's like but I was like fullon woke when I was 24 get it it's a thing of a person being a good person who's compassionate who wants to do good for people who thinks they're moving in the right direction but the problem is it's not in align with the understanding that we have currently of psychology and of how people behave and of of laws and the the the idea of punishment and crime like you have to have some of that stuff you have to have incentives for people to do well but you also have to have disincentives for them they have to be punished if they commit crimes you have to have Law and Order but you have to have compassion you have to have good will but you have to have you have to have law you have you have to model it on good parenting man it's like yes that's what that's where it's and and also good Community I think parenting is one aspect of your your ability to develop growing up you like neighbors are important too man friends absolutely uncles all those people are important in your life the aunts you know everybody your grandparents there they're import there's a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] going on there input coming into a person I just love like thinking like what's outside of propaganda parenting it isn't outside of propaganda but you can look like as a parent I can see like look it doesn't matter what my ideals are regarding regulation Forest is not going to be allowed yeah to go into the pool unless I'm there with him 100% he'll die he'll die so there's like real like there's like a a true like to me there's a an eternal sort of path in in like looking at what good parenting is across cultur cultures and you realize like you know you're an idiot if you think that people in the vast number of humans on Earth if you think that people in that vast number aren't insane like what percentage are insane like well you're insane everybody's insane what isane that's the problem like what by what is that metric you know a [\\xa0__\\xa0] yard is 3 ft saying I'm talking like like people who are like registered sex offenders or you know what I mean like that that like pathos like true narcissist true sociopaths like we live in a world where from time to time but it's still a spectrum right cuz like what if someone's saying but they're a gambling addict and they keep losing all their families money every year on poker games right we got to figure out a way to help them without simultaneously creating tyranny have you [\\xa0__\\xa0] with ibaan no I don't want it man I'm terrified of that [\\xa0__\\xa0] I haven't [\\xa0__\\xa0] with iasa I smoke DMT from time to time but I'm scared of a 6-h hour DMT trip much less IA gain freak have you done IA gain no I don't have any like uh physical addictions that I'm trying to kick or real uh personal addictions I've kind of got those things dialed in in terms of my workout and you know work schedule and Family schedule it's pretty good right now I got a good Harmony I got a good Rhythm and I'm going to keep that up yeah but um people that I know that have really needed it or people that got hurt and then they got uh prescribed pain pills and the pain pill is what got them I know quite a few people that have turned to the Ia gain two good friends that have turned to the Ia gain and it knocked them right off uh of the addiction and right back on path and it's really disturbing to me because it's not it it doesn't seem to be killing people and it's not legal and uh I think going forward in this country we're going to have to come to grips with a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] one of the things we're going to have to come to grips with is uh we've got and this is not a bad thing okay if any company should is allowed to donate to a political candidate any company a [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know any company Chocolate Company a company that buy makes cars if then a drug company probably should too if they're allowed to sell drugs maybe they should be allowed to to to to give money to corporations or give money rather to politicians that are running for government why not why everybody can do it who's to say they can't and the [\\xa0__\\xa0] guys who make cars can when they're polluting the air okay who knows but at the end of the day we have to go yo there's a lot of people getting hooked on these pills yeah there's a lot of people ruining their lives in these pills and we're turning a blind eye because there's a lot of money involved in these pills and it's weird it's weird it's weird like the cigarette thing it's if we're so worried about 170,000 people dying of covid why aren't we worried about half a million dying from cigarettes why aren't we worried about all the people that not just dying but losing their [\\xa0__\\xa0] their Sanity on opioids how many people in this country are hooked on [\\xa0__\\xa0] pain pills is it I mean do we even know the real number cuz how many people are functional where they're hooked on it but they're just like taking one or two a day and they're just going to work every day and they just stay in this steady Haze of [\\xa0__\\xa0] working for [\\xa0__\\xa0] uh you know HTS rent a car and they just deal and they got a prescription so it's all good doctor says hair Brave New World baby Brave New World this is uh all this these are all the things that I think of and I this is it gives me a this is the perspective that I have in this day and age right now as I'm talking to you a place of humility because I I I'm more aware now than any other time in my life that no one is in control of this thing and that we all have to just stop thinking that Daddy's going to rescue us that's right CU there is no Daddy garcetti's not your daddy Gavin Newsome's not your daddy Donald Trump's not your daddy Nancy Pelosi is not your mama none of these things the these are just people and we have to look at this in an objective first of all anyone who's famous anyone I don't care if you're Donald Trump or Nancy Pelosi those are famous people everybody knows their name everybody knows what they look like that's a wild way to live that's a wild crazy way to live yeah that's a crazy way to live and then you're out there also dictating what people can and can't do and you're also dictating where the taxes go you're Auto you're not the idea is like by becoming famous you become antithetical to the very thing that you're representing so how can you represent it anymore if you have you I'm not saying you can't but I'm saying that's a that's a different ride that's a different that's a different ride than a regular person yeah if you're if you're a famous person and you're all of a sudden at the the Helm of an Empire that's dropping drone bombs on people [\\xa0__\\xa0] you woo shouldn't the greatest government be a government that has an idea of eventually there'll be no more government there should be but then you have [\\xa0__\\xa0] like 9/11 you go what happened we get attacked if if we know but did we I don't know I don't know what happened what happened I don't know who trained those people who designed that a lot of things happen afterwards that people will say did those things that happen afterwards happen because and this is my belief my belief is that all the things that happened after 911 in terms of like uh the Patriot Act and all these other things they happened because people were taking advantage of an opening where they recognized that a lot of people were scared and then they started implementing these ideas that they would love to do during peace time but they would be accepted that's my the dogs of war but this is my interpretation some people are under the impression that they actually orchestrated the event and then afterwards implementing these new rules and everybody went along with it because the event they orchestrated now I'm not saying I know that that's not the case and this is what's the scariest [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing to admit when you know about operation Northwoods you know that the government 1963 was literally planning on blowing up a jet airliner and blaming it on Cuba they were going to arm Cuban friendlies and attack Guantanamo Bay they're going to do whatever they could to get us into a war with Cuba this was signed by The Joint Chiefs of Staff they're like I like it I like deception I like what you're going to do you're going to kill people woo let's go to war baby go to war if they did that in what was it 62 or 63 who who knows how that's evolved right why why wouldn't that evolve everything evolv evolves okay technology evolves her understanding of uh bi biology evolves everything evolves everything evolves tell you know what evolved what evolved was not the technique what evolved was the story the technique seems to be the same you look at the news that Putin opponent he [\\xa0__\\xa0] Keels over in an airplane moaning all you had to drink was tea the Kremlin apparently says we wish him a speedy recovery and everyone's like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] and it's like wait actually the use of poison and imperialism is a pretty classic basic technique like not just in Game of Thrones but like in general if you're an imperialist and your interest is like power you you use whatever technique you have to use to doesn't that technique and using it in that way point to this thing that we're really worried about what we're really worried about is there this there's this underlying narrative that's going on where these Elites are battling it out and these Warlords these evil sociopaths that run the world are battling it out all the well they don't think they but they don't do it out they don't just have a guy just [\\xa0__\\xa0] blow his brains out on the airplane and then just jump right off on the tarmac and then he gets rescued by the Russian police and then nobody says anything about it ever no they do it in a weird sneaky way where it's like there's some plausible deniability involved right well they for number one they don't think they're evil Putin doesn't wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and go I'm an evil Jackal what are the henchmen of the Apocalypse Putin probably wakes up in the morning I imagine he stretches he looks at his phone he's got texts from his friends he's like that [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] that [\\xa0__\\xa0] and then he like and then more than likely he probably exercises and then he go and he I bet a lot of times Putin wakes up in the morning he's like I don't want to go to work I bet a lot of times he's like God damn it I just want to [\\xa0__\\xa0] off all day then he has to go to work he's stuck being Putin Trump wakes up in the morning same problem he's like this sucks he's drinking diet coke watching Fox News promise you TW out crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] he wakes up in the morning like takes whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] drug he's on what do you think he's taking dude I don't know want some of it if he had a guess he's on some kind of he's on amphetamin I would say I don't know what it is but some sort of diet pill was it ever confirmed that that whole thing where they said they found the very R Dwayne Reed Pharmacy in New York City where he had been taking going beat up somebody for being on drugs listen to me man he's 74 he wins okay if you can make that much money while you're on amphetamines and you don't die then they're right the doctors are right the doctor likes it's safe he's like are you sure I want to make money I want to keep going I don't want to sleep like just take this [\\xa0__\\xa0] you don't have to sleep and he just keeps going he rattles off [\\xa0__\\xa0] campaign speeches and hops in a helicopter and flies a thousand miles away find me a 70-year-old not on drugs and I will give you a $100 give me a [\\xa0__\\xa0] break you're 70 you're going to die in like 20 you're going to die like if when I'm 7 oh my mouth is going to be like a baby bird underneath any drugs that any wants to put in of course we we're both high now yeah drugs are fine like I don't care if Trump is on drugs or Putin's on drugs or whoever's on drugs it's like the point is like the these the problem is that like we like to imagine like Trump wakes up in the morning and it's like let me destroy this country Trump wakes up in the morning in a haze he takes some weird drugs he tries to remember what he's doing I promise you every morning he thinks to himself why the [\\xa0__\\xa0] did I listen to my kid I guarantee it was this kid he's like Dad you got to run for president no he's like no no no no no no you don't think you think he want I don't think he wants to be president no no no it was Obama talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] about him 100% 100% when when Obama was doing that dinner you know that uh that's that uh that thing that they do every year where they have comedians go what's it called again Jamie the Press roast White House correspondence Center yeah White House correspondence Center and Donald Donald Trump's in the audience and Barack Obama's going deep and he's hitting it with some bombs it was good it was good and one of the things he hits him with is here's one thing I am that you'll never be president of the United States and everybody goes oh it's like you know that Meme with the kid in the hoodie with the glasses and he's just standing there all the other kids are running around going oh he summ a demon can we hear some of this or we get in trouble it was a brutal resist is that like uh public domain or anything I don't know do you think he wrote it do you think he wrote it I don't think he wrote it oh sure he would write that because Trump was a part of the birther moment but here's the thing honestly legitimately I hope he was born in Kenya I hope they pulled it off cuz I don't care cuz my grandparents are born in Italy I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't need you to be born this patch of dirt you know why CU I'm not a [\\xa0__\\xa0] idiot I don't think you should have to be born on a patch of dirt look should you be have to be born in uh [\\xa0__\\xa0] Calabasas in order to be the president of uh noou or whatever that's a bad example but you have to live it's a restaurant a sushi restaurant Malu do you have to live like in the town like what what are you saying the all the patch of dirt is significant where was you expelled out of the vagina I I moved here when I was 13 minutes old is that okay what if I what if I my mom shat me out in the middle of a plane on the way across the Pacific am I American who cares it's stupid it's dumb it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] dumb well it's that's like geospatial centrism I hope he's born in Kenya I hope I hope he admits it I hope he says oh and by the way I was born in Kenya oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] if Obama wanted to you know you have that everybody has like one friend like please come out come out of the closet please please no one will no one will care this is there's never been a better time if OB I'm not saying Obama was born in Kenya I believe everything he says I believe he was born in Hawaii but part of me wishes he was actually born in Kenya and he waits until after the election and if Biden wins he just gets to the m by the way I was born in Kenya oh and the whole audience just goes B the Earth turns into a son everything would erupt man I got to pee I got to pee go pee but what are you going to do when I go pee Jamie has editing equipment oh right he's the wizard don't take headphones off headphones Don't Run Away you WRA behind the back that was close I don't want it to end we're not we don't have to end okay great great there was one thing that I wanted to make sure um when we decided to go to Spotify one the one of the first things I thought of is Duncan trussle has to be episode number one that was like a legitimate thing I thought because there's something about my relationship with Duncan it's very unique like he brings things out of me he he puts me in a the when you're around certain friends they put you in a state of mind that you don't go into when you're not with them when I'm with Joey Diaz one of the things I love about Joey Diaz I'm always smiling when I'm with Joey Diaz first of all cuz he knows I love him I've I've loved him forever we've been friends for every every time I see him I hug him him so because he knows I love him when we're around he just starts talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] he he gets loose cuz he knows that I'm his number one fan and uh another person like that is Duncan when I'm around Duncan there's something like we do to each other like we're like some sort of a weird epoxy where you mix it together where he puts my mind in a place that it doesn't ordinarily go to automat like I think I genuinely believe there's ideas that I form when I'm talking to Duncan like ideas pop in my head when I'm talking to him that they don't get there anywhere else and it's it kind of goes in with what we're talking about about that other guy's idea of uh thoughts and and my my concept of ideas that maybe they're a life form maybe they're just like eoli that lives in your gut or the Flora that's on your skin and that they different people have different combinations of those things just like some people people you just don't Vibe with them you talk to them you just want to get away from them as quick as possible you like oh this person's so annoying and you can't help it for whatever reason it's like they say that women firmon wise like women can smell a man's clothes and they can sort of I don't know if this is true but I read that they can accurately depict if they smell a man's clothes whether or not they uh should be attracted to that man whether or not they're genetically they they match up well with that man but that gets [\\xa0__\\xa0] up when they're on birth control yeah that's when they're on birth control it gets confused yeah it's well it's it's in sex of daon but it was a real study and there's a real uh concern about that that people are you know you we're losing some of our senses dude I was in a relationship with a woman who got off birth control and stop wanting to [\\xa0__\\xa0] me and I remember like hearing that and like being able to refer to the moment that she seemed to be really into me but then she got out of birth control and suddenly her like real intuition was like you don't want to make babies with this guy this guy's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and she stopped She Stopped it was real like I remember the moment it happened it was so bizarre it was like it it was great I'm glad by the way I'm glad cuz like the baby that we made is so beautiful and like have you heard this [\\xa0__\\xa0] about the egg picks the sperm have you heard about this how the egg does this is the new research it's like you know as dudes were always like well we make the come and there's a sperm that makes it to the end of the race and that's the one that makes the baby so in our minds we're like it's our it's like a sperm that won a marathon gets into the egg as a reward for winning the marathon but now the idea is the egg actually is like the sperm are running to the finish line and the Egg sends out chemicals to destabilize certain sperm and picks the one that fits best with the the the the whatever the plan of the egg is look at that human eggs use chemical signals to attract sperm humans spend a lot of time and energy choosing their partner new study by researchers from Stockholm University and Manchester University NHS Foundation trust shows that choosing your partner continues even after sex human eggs can choose sperm it's the goddest baby dudes it's like the last [\\xa0__\\xa0] Bastion we had was this idea that we had this athletic little bit of our come that made it it's really the mother egg that picks it off come come to me come to me and the rest back to Mama it sends out signals to destroy certain sperm trying to make that made it all that way chosy eggs May pick sperm for their genes defying Mel's law we're we're done but then again the sperm that get there those are still at the front of the pack yeah like in Price is Right they're the on most likely the egg you know the eggs get like look I want the best SPM but the best one's going to be the one that's there first anyway it's maybe it's both things it's good it's sweet it's it's sweet it's kind of both things right yeah but the final decision is the egg [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass lazy sperm that just bounces off the head of the rugged sperm and like winds up plop wow can't believe you chose me she like I didn't [\\xa0__\\xa0] now I have a nerd and the the egg gets really pissed because it's not a precise mechanism there's a lot of chaos going on to encourage you know entropy and to encage Innovation that they figure out how to better the better uh version of the species to get into the egg but sometimes there's a head butt and then the dumb Dum goes right in head first and bang you got a kid that's not that bright you don't want that kid but then that being said so those kids are supposed to get eaten by Coyotes on one level it's great because it says actually the goddess chooses everything but then on another level you've got Hitler exactly so that Hitler's mom's egg had a bunch of other sperm that were like we're not doing a genocide and what's the connection with what we talked about before with Hitler amphetamines yeah Hitler was all about they would inject Coke in him and testosterone in him there's a legendary story about how melini wanted to talk to Hitler about pulling out of the war and Hitler showed up shot up with cocaine and testosterone and just yeah I don't even musini know what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] he was saying but he sweated on him until musolini relented dude I don't know if that's true McKenna used to talk about alcohol in this way like the idea like we survived alcohol just like the well he talked about alcohol being the differentiation between the ancient psychedelic cultures they like uh chop tall hi that worship the cattle which like shat on the ground the mushrooms grow from and they had all this mushroom iconography to when they started preserving things and preserving things in Honey which meant fermented honey which meant meat which meant alcohol and then they switched to an alcohol-based society when they couldn't grow the mushrooms anymore because of climate change or because they were moving and moving in different directions this is what I think happened this is where I disagree with McKenna what I think first of all how confident are you not that confident the fact that you say I disagree with McKenna I was about to apologize to Dennis McKenna and say I acknowledge I'm a complete dope well he he disagrees with his brother sometimes yeah but he disagrees in Le and ethnobotanist disagrees with a scientist not in the way some [\\xa0__\\xa0] guy somebody literally goes at night goes to Red a conspiracy and disagrees who literally on a show called Joe Rogan questions everything we investigated UFO materials I'm sure like Stephen Hawking disagreed with Albert Einstein you went to a bunker to talk to a dude who's going to start a cult and you're like hey you guys grow tomatoes no like I'm I'm I remember coming back I'm like what was that guy like like he was a really nice guy I'm like well kind a nice guy digs a hole the side of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] mountain and Parks his SUV this guy's crazy bro it's so stupid to say I disagree with with with like one of the great mods and I acknowledge that uh but but uh you know to me like this is where this is what I picture happening so okay we're storing our mushrooms in jars of alcohol right we're storing our mushrooms in jars of alcohol and the rich people the elites eat the mushrooms they all trip out in their little orgiastic [\\xa0__\\xa0] awesome thing and then who's left the people whose job it is to put the mushrooms and the alcohol and what's left these jars they have a little bit of booze in them and some mushroom residue they drink it and then they start you know like that would be the beginning of like getting [\\xa0__\\xa0] up on alcohol I I I guess what I'm saying is like I I imagine that like really like if you look at like okay mushrooms or LSD or any psychedelic it teaches you you're a we not an i you're a we not a me and and and and booze what does it teach you you're a me when you're all pissed off on booze 100% of the time you're not angry because you're like worried about the conditions of the world you're usually angry cuz someone like what's funnier than when you like insult an alcoholic how many times You' been around like a do have you ever heard of Alcoholics feelings we you say to them hey you're an alcoholic and you see that look in their face where they recognize that you're telling the truth yeah then it really hurts yeah they get mad at you yeah yeah dude I I like the alcoholic outrage is one of the most like desperately sad things to witness there's nothing worse than a drunk whose feelings are hurt because usually their feelings are hurt because because you told the truth too yeah yeah they don't want the truth and so cuz their their condition depends on lies so well it's a weird um like one of the things about alcohol it's like it sort of Narrows reality yeah you know like if you think of one of the things that I really really enjoy about Edibles there's a thing that I enjoy when I get so paranoid and so freaked out that I don't think I'm going to make it and then I come down from that and I get to this place of humility and that's one of my favorite places to be as a person when I'm coming down from like a horrendous edible high and then all a sudden I'm like real thankful that it's over I just want to be friends with people yeah like there there's that space and it it it sort of bro like the world broadens your danger broadens your humility your Humanity your vulnerability broadens and then it comes back to a manageable level and you recognize that it could be so far worse than what you're experiencing currently and it's just your perspective that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] things up cuz right now with you and me right here no people have ever been more comfortable in the history of humanity no we're both in love we both have children we're both drunk and high we're both love each other we're both making each other laugh anybody in this position that looks at things incorrectly but like our our problem is always perspective our problem is always not recognizing how good we have it when we have it that's right dude this is like there's a Buddhist teacher Jack corfield who says tend to the part of the garden you can touch and also choim choe in one of his books one of the things he said was look it could he and he meant it it could be there's an ism that's good there's an ism that's the right way to be like it could be socialism communism who knows Capital he didn't say that but there could be an ism that works right because we we can't we can't accept the fact the isms of the past are the only ones that are ever going to be available that's crazy there might be a utopian ideal that is applicable to than now or just better but what he said what I love about what he said is it doesn't matter if you can't find peace in your own home yes if when you're in your own home there's disharmony if you're in your own home people are unhappy in your own home people are freaked out then why would you even think about socialism Capital capitalism or communism when the when the when the pixel of re of society is the house the household and if within that pixel there's division then of course in the world that division would be like made into some monstrous thing so well even down to the core to the singular you as a human who are you okay yes do you have your [\\xa0__\\xa0] together or no sometimes yes sometimes no sometimes yes sometimes no and everybody wants to point at people who don't go look at you you don't have your [\\xa0__\\xa0] together Duncan I know I know you got three qus of your [\\xa0__\\xa0] together that's not helping me get my [\\xa0__\\xa0] together that with your white privilege but I'm trying to be better I believe you but you must be punished I'm not sure for how long well that's aggression silence I want Silence from you for an extended period of time on the side give the further the silence the more you're going to appease people you can wait 10 years no one like four people be upset look man 10 months all like to me like it's like the whole that that whole ball of wax man is like dude like after once I started like the thing is like when all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] happened and as a comedian I was like really afraid to get into like even like a little bit of studying the [\\xa0__\\xa0] people are upset about cuz like no like comedian in their right mind wants to be identified with like some woke ass comedian because it's embarrassing but then when I started looking into it and then I found out about the George Washington [\\xa0__\\xa0] the George Washington [\\xa0__\\xa0] is super creepy creepy because there's no way if those teeth were valuable that people weren't murdered for their teeth that's it like there's no way people weren't like just held down and they got their teeth stolen or they were told that they were going to get money and they weren't and they were many of them were have been raped but here's the thing is there real value in getting outraged at [\\xa0__\\xa0] that happened hundreds of years ago or is it is it a an acknowledgment of first of all the fact that we all agree we do better that's what the turmoil the turmoil exists all of it social economic the turmoil exists because we haven't really come to grips with whether or not we can all get together and be cool with each other all the time yeah so there's always some sort of turmoil and when you look at turmoil in terms of like whether it's Financial turmoil or social turmoil we're always trying to figure out like who's being the [\\xa0__\\xa0] right don't you feel like that like when you what do you mean when you see anything that's happening like when you see um when when when you when you see uh a government getting overthrown when you see War you always like who is being the [\\xa0__\\xa0] any kind of turmoil you mean you try to find the perpetrator of the difficulty right what's causing it and is it possible that most of this [\\xa0__\\xa0] could be avoided and what's stopping most of it from being avoided when you look at any kind of any kind of government like any kind of country in invade anytime a country invades another country anytime bombs are being dropped from drones like what can be done to avoid this that's right what can be done dude I man I I started this [\\xa0__\\xa0] pandemic philosophy Club is what we call it with like my friends Marcus and Brandon what's up we don't even do a podcast every Friday we just get together and talk and uh they like midnight gospel that's how I got lucky enough to meet them Midnight gospel is an amazing show dude can I just say before we get going I'm really proud of you really really proud of you cuz it represents you as an artist more than like almost anything any of my friends who've ever done has done cuz you're so weird and it's so weird but it's so funny and it's so amazing it's amazing they let us make it I can't believe they let us make it praise Odin for Netflix praise Odin praise Odin but what they've done is amazing but what you've done is somehow or another encapsulate what some of the things I love about you how weird you are how uh you're not like anybody else when you came here today one of the things I said to you I go dude I go you're the only guy that like I like listening to your ads that's sweet Joe I do thanks your [\\xa0__\\xa0] expressvpn ad is a hilarious ad it took so long I didn't even know if it was an ad just some crazy but you're the best I you you are the the best that I've ever seen at reading ads out of all the people that I've ever heard who read ads your ads are the most entertaining you're very sweet Joe and I'm not going to get in a a [\\xa0__\\xa0] competition with you but I wouldn't be here if not for you and that's the truth and I'll never stop saying it and I will never stop being grateful to you for but I wouldn't I wouldn't be me if it wasn't for my friendship with you either swe it's true it's appr we all benefit each other from yeah but I'm I don't mean to cut you off I'm so sorry by the way I had a a little bit of boost so forgive my like impetuousness that I would like suddenly interrupt you but you do have a history of finding like young comedians who are like and you do like help us a lot and we are eternally grateful to you and I don't care if you don't acknowledge it you won't acknowledge it because if you did you're afraid you'll go crazy it's not that I want I'll I'll tell you from my perspective it's not that I'll go crazy it's that I have to do it there's no ifans or butts it's a path it's like if you're going down if you're on a [\\xa0__\\xa0] uh one one of those uh water slides and you're going flying down you're just going that way if you're a good person and you love and you love Comedians and you have friends and you want to see them happy and you want to see them successful and you know they're good and you know it benefits not just them but you to elevate them I'm like hey check out Annie Letterman hey check out everybody whoever it is it's like I want them to know that my relationship with them anybody who's listening to this podcast or anybody listens to my standup or watches it it's genuine that's who I am so if I find someone who's awesome I want you know about it I don't want to get paid for it if I find a great band I start talking about it on Instagram I find a great application I tell people it's cool I have the obligation this I didn't know if I did or but I didn't I don't I don't think I'm in a position that everybody's in it's a weird spot and might I say I'm so glad that Annie Letterman is someone that you your attention is she is so funny she's so funny her podcast is so [\\xa0__\\xa0] funny I'm sure it is but dude her and Whitney dude this is what happened we were at The Comedy Store the other night Mike binder Mike binder is doing his uh his whole uh uh Showtime documentary thing so we're all on the roof it was fun man I got to chat with Paul Rodriguez very cool dude I've really never got a lot of time spending uh talking to Paul rodrig before he's really cool man he's really he had some good good uh good stories about uh South America and Latin America and Mexico where comedians who actually got jailed yeah really interesting [\\xa0__\\xa0] and Bill bur was hilarious and Annie Letterman was on fire and then there was Whitney Cummings and Jay Leno and we had a good [\\xa0__\\xa0] time man it was a real and Mike binder it was a really good [\\xa0__\\xa0] time it really was it was um it was it first of all it reminded me how much I love that place like I walked in there I was like God damn I got so emotional when I walked through the door but when I had Whitney and Annie together and they're talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] to each other I'm like these girls are so funny and they love each other they're really good friends and and and I said Whitney was scheduled to be on the podcast and then I said to her I said do you care if Annie comes I want Annie to come but it's up to you she's like [\\xa0__\\xa0] Yeah so I brought Annie in too and the two of them together dude they're Savages that's that's the future of female comedy and the future of podcasting because there's all these like like that's a popular thing now like guys we [\\xa0__\\xa0] they they're killing it and then there's the call her daddy that CHS killing it like they're on a different vibration than you Duncan Trussell but there a really popular sort of segment yeah and these two girls together two hilarious standup Comics talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] together on a podcast I'm like you guys have to do it but they're also like you got to admit like they're Gonzo like the Hunter Thompson thing like they're full Gonzo both of them are like terrifying in their own way like you know what I mean like when you encounter either of them I have to help them right you have to have to help them do a podcast it has to be Annie and Whitney because the A's make you find it quicker the world deserves it but like I remember going to do any when I to be Annie and Whitney when I went to do Annie Letterman's podcast I won't give anything away any what happened I'm not I can't say it on it's not legal but like I remember like leaving there being like wow holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] like I remember leaving there just thinking like H not just that not whatever I'm saying right now I'm saying like realizing like I I've always loved chatting with Annie letan we have great conversations but I remember like getting into her where she lived and looking around and realizing like well she's formed some kind of cult I don't know what it is she's really funny man she's so funny and and like that like just that moment of like wow like you're you're like both of them well that it's the thing is is like like this uh acknowledgement first of all you your your podcast has a cult following and you've hit this like weird place and I think you feel very similar to the way I do that when you find someone who's extraordinary you want to let everybody else know exact we we both have that we all of us have that Joey has that Ari has that Ari is one of the be if you're AR's friend and you have a special coming out Ari will promote the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of you he's amazing at that he did it for Joe list he's done it for Mark Norman he's helped get guys on my podcast and I blow them up because if you're friends with r you're friends with me but we're all like that Diaz red band's like that Tony hinch Cliff's like that everybody will tell you all the people around them that are killing it and I think that's real important man I think it's an important thing to get out there there's a there's a frequency there's a frequency that we're all sending out and it's a frequency of camaraderie you know of uh it doesn't matter if you're wrong sometimes s or just like sometimes you [\\xa0__\\xa0] up like we're all like trying to go the right direction you know when we're talking about that dumb sperm that clashes heads with the alpha sperm and just accidentally slides in that [\\xa0__\\xa0] is going to happen that's right all these things are going to but we we have to move forward in the spirit of camaraderie and this is like the big test let's can we for a second just draw I don't care it's so cheesy and everyone you've heard everyone's heard you talk about the C store let's just spit a second go with The Comedy Store man because like for me and this is the truth and like you know I was talking to Ari he's like you never I'm like I I was going up like twice a week but even if I wasn't he said you never went no for a second cuz he did you worked there dude that's how we became friends I know but from Ari saw me in a really dark period where I was like not showing up for spots and he rightfully judges me for that but like it's okay I get was that when you were living with me that was after I was living with you I went through a dark period I didn't take I took it for GR granted and I deserve no but I whatever is dunin you just always been complicated that's it's not it's not you're complicated you know I was having a conversation with someone and they were saying like uh it's okay to have a loose chassis but you got to stay on the road yeah I I try to stay on the road man but I love The Comedy Store I love it with all my heart dude when when you and I became friends we should tell people you and I became friends cuz I would call into the comedy store and I say hey I'm here uh Thursday Friday and Saturday and you be like cool man hey did you [\\xa0__\\xa0] see this thing that they're saying is happening in Nepal where all these people are getting together and they're all seeing these like we' have these crazy conversations that go for hours You' you You' put me on hold you would take another call and then we would talk about [\\xa0__\\xa0] Terrence McKenna and Graham Hancock the best dude we had we would get baked on the phone where Duncan Trussell was a comedy store employee and I was I was at home and and we would get high and we would just start talking about aliens it was the best it was the best man that place is a temple for real dude but you and I became pen like phone Pals we but that's how we got to be friends and like here we are right now the funny thing is the conversation we're having is no different than the conversation we had when I was working there but I was saying to Jamie when you left and went to pee the the people bring things out of people and it's something that I don't think people like to admit but sometimes people bring bad things out of people and sometimes people bring good things out of people and when I'm with you I'm different than when I'm not with you yeah man I don't like I I really don't want this conversation to end like I'm not going to get all sapience in the you fly to Austin occasionally I'll fly any you want man I'll come I'll come anytime you want but like it won't to me it's like this is my solution to all this I'm just going to fly people out and put them up and pay for their food it'll be great get them massages it'll be great man but like all that being said like we just I just don't I don't think anyone can understand what it's like unless they've been there to get off stage at The Comedy Store and you have a good set maybe but you're working on a joke and you get off stage and suddenly Whitney Cummings who's like a very rightfully successful brilliantly funny person stops you and says hey what do you think about this addition to your punchline you know what I mean like those moments are so so like so like cuz CU in that moment there isn't like a hierarchy like in that moment there isn't like look I made like shows for Network TV Dude one of my proudest moments as a comic I was at the Improv and this was like 200 [\\xa0__\\xa0] three or some [\\xa0__\\xa0] like that and uh Louis CK sits in the back of the room and takes notes and then we get off stage and he actually asked me before he goes do you mind if I watch and like give you some like like give you some notes I dude I'd [\\xa0__\\xa0] love that yeah and then afterwards he had a bunch of really funny suggest questions I don't remember if I wind up using any of them but it was just so fun so fun to hear him and I talk about like bits and the fact that he would like sit down and watch these bits that's it that was the that's the so to me like you know and I like I would always tell Aaron my my wife I would always say like you know there's no Comedy Store anywhere else like I I want to go I want to be here I don't think it's impossible to make that somewhere else this is the whole reason why I'm interested in moving to Texas I don't believe that we have to be Tethered to this machine that makes things that we don't do right this machine makes music this machine makes movies and it makes TV shows and we don't do any of those things we're in a totally different business and I don't think we have to be connected to any sort of Legacy entertainment structure it doesn't make any sense and it's they just trying to siphon money off of you right it's just like they they're not they're missing the point like I want to tell the truth I don't want to just sell things I want I want I want to say what I'm thinking right now whether it's good or bad or angry or sad or remorseful I want to be able to say it anytime I want to say it and this is not acceptable in the the the the regular old school Legacy medium that that that people are thinking of as as mainstream media and it was mainstream media like 20 years ago or 30 years ago but what we're you and I are doing right now is writing on a [\\xa0__\\xa0] cave wall compared to what's coming what you and I are doing right now compared to what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is going to happen when Elon Musk starts producing this whole neural link yeah and then they they they develop some sort of [\\xa0__\\xa0] uh satellite Network where everyone's connected and reading each other's minds all over the globe dude this is cave wall scratch tickets [\\xa0__\\xa0] I know and to me we playing ticktock toe by the fire but this is what's this is to me like the poignant thing about like Neolithic structures is like you see the Neolithic structure and you know like [\\xa0__\\xa0] man people spent a long time building that and in this in the process of building that they became friends and they shared stories and it was really beautiful but now all we see is some old eroded [\\xa0__\\xa0] that we don't know anything about right yeah so to me what's beautiful is like you are absolutely right this thing we're doing right now it's it doesn't matter if like what we're doing is like moris code it's going to be go it doesn't matter if it's a million years but it won't be a million years it be it won't be that long before our conversation seem dated but you know what we're doing also we're doing the same thing that Beethoven was doing where they were making music at a time where you couldn't record it so you had to write it down yeah we're doing this some clunky ver like if you could listen imagine if you could listen to the actual orchestra that was playing like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony sh that's crazy you imagine bro also being in context never having heard the doors never having heard hendri people cough yeah right never having heard any of that only being in that era wow and sitting in the audience be crazy is that b toan's fifth did I make that up Jamie act like no no I don't terrible impression it was like who am I but think of how power being there in the moment when it was first released yeah and no one could record anything and now you had write it you had to write it down in some weird they had to develop a language for music say what it was yeah I mean you could be a badass guitarist in 2020 and not have any idea how to read music yeah that's right right that's right you could like watch videos and just decide I'm just going to go full Stevie Rance some people don't want to know yeah they want to be able to just free oh what's the earliest recording of that is this hooked on can you play that or we get in trouble see what Happ you can't play it that is it that's it right that's be toan's fifth I mean bro imagine being alive back then when you never heard any [\\xa0__\\xa0] like that dude I was sitting in the audience do you remember when Notorious BIG IG big big IG biggie you remember when Biggie came out with hypnotized no do you remember how old were you I don't know the year I don't know hypnotized seems like 95 because I was on uh I was on news radio and uh I remember driving to work what year 97 97 yeah so okay I was on news radio from 94 to 99 so I was on news radio and I remember driving to work and hearing that going whoa they just crack through some new level yeah biggy biggy Biggie can't you see sometimes your words they hypnotize me great song oh my God but it was just there was something about it where I was like oh somebody figured out a new level of the video game yeah they SP a ton of money on of course you did dude you don't understand what it was like back then no internet you would see him on MTV with piles of cash there was no account ility that's so cool like this is the like one like there's a a a concept in Buddhism which is like if you want to really has even started yet that's all just helicopters and [\\xa0__\\xa0] how many helicopters do you need look at him look at him biggy man do you know how many [\\xa0__\\xa0] amazing songs we missed out on because Biggie and Tupac didn't get together and smoke pot how [\\xa0__\\xa0] that have a couple of drinks like somebody had them tricked that they were enemies imagine if Biggie and Tupac was just like me and Stan hope or Like Comics Like Comics who just like like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are we we we should love each other we're the only ones that are like how many goddamn MC's are there how many rappers are there how many stand-ups are there there's so few we should be so happy we run it we can't that's that kind of talk will get you killed because that's the last Bastion of the thing that wants to keep us limited man it's like that's the idea is like but even them man I'm telling you for them they need to listen up I know you want to have control but sometimes not having control is better like here's the thing in archery let me tell you something about archery there's a thing about archery where it's very few people can what they call command shoot what that means is when you draw back the bow and you have your finger on the trigger you just decide when the arrow is going to go okay sure most people don't do it that way and most people who do these big tournaments like even the Olympics they teach them to have a surprise release it's a psychological trick where you're using a certain type of release where either you have your finger on a trigger and you don't push your finger you just let your back muscles pull it because they're crude muscles or you use what's called a hinge you slowly pull in the hinge and the the arrow goes but you don't know when it's going to go whereas a trigger you know exactly where it's going to go but there's something about knowing exactly where it's going to go where you just [\\xa0__\\xa0] you tense up you twitch and it's hard it's hard you just goally if you're in a tournament you're in the Olympics medal round so very few people in the Olympics allow their brain to decide when the shot goes isn't that interesting yeah yeah that's beautiful I get what you're saying too there there's a the mind of no mind the the ability to get out of your own way and for Archers the best way to do this is either in the hinge release or a release with a thumb where you pull through with your back muscles and it makes the the thumb trigger go off so cool this thing is dangerous this thing's dangerous cuz you could be develop what's called Target panic and there's people that never like my friend cam Haynes he's a freak of nature he's never developed Target panic and he shoots like this he sees things he shoots at them and he's perfect he shoot 140 yards Boop pop balloons and [\\xa0__\\xa0] but he also runs a marathon a day he's like a freak of nature he's a very rare human but you can't Bank it on those people you got to think about the rest of the folks for the rest of the folks the whole idea is like getting rid of anxiety and what's anxiety anxiety is pulling a trigger if you're in a gold medal round I just hit that bull side this is it America wins and you just Flinch there's just a little a little thing that happens to you that you don't want to happen and your arrow just goes 4 in shy mark it [\\xa0__\\xa0] love it yeah that's the so that is the so like and I'm sorry every every podcast I do with you I talk about Buddhism but I don't care I want you to talk about Buddhism thank you so like what I love about it is like so everybody gets caught up in the first two ideas and Buddhism the first being life is unsatisfactory the second being the reason life is unsatisfactory is because you think it's a way that is not now this gets translated in a lot of let's break that down life is unsatisfactory and the reason you think life is unsatisfactory is because well life so the the best way to put it would be have you ever been with someone in traffic in LA and they're angry me okay but when have you ever myself right but that's literally the way traffic is in La yes yet somehow like because you drove that day into traffic you got into your head this would be the one day in La where there wouldn't be traffic no honestly I keep it together but I do I do I recognize that it's knocking on the door it's like come on be a [\\xa0__\\xa0] freak out yeah I really do keep it together but that this is also the real argument for micro doing because if you could just micro do there would be so much less negative interactions with people whether it's on the highway or anywhere no one's going to no one who's micro doing on siloc cybin is going to yell at you from across the street put your [\\xa0__\\xa0] mask on no they're not going to do that you're going to let them be themselves but I want to be I want to be the person that makes people smile I I don't want to be the person that makes people mad I don't either and and this is something I'm like consciously thinking about more and more as I get older I I want I want us to do better I like really do this is one of the reasons why I have this idea of like starting over in Texas I have this idea of like this connecting from all these old hubs and this idea of what we're doing when we're putting out content into the world I don't believe it I don't believe it has to be from a media center I don't believe it has to be from New York or La I don't believe it and I I think I want to prove to myself that it doesn't have to I want to go one of the reasons why I wanted to go to Texas is cuz it's like almost like there's a there's a certain mockery to live in in Texas you know listen especially for someone like me I wouldn't want to be you like you you you everything you do is too study didn't and like I like like I like being free of that magnifying lens but you know to me like whenever I'm thinking about uh like you know it's fun to think about what's the root problem here the root problem seems to be centralization it's like wherever centralization rears its head problems emerge the root problem is compassion what do you mean the root problem is compassion that we don't make our decisions based on compassion we make them based on beneficial markers of improvement whether it's Financial Improvement or land grabs or that's the problem the problem is that we we we have these things in our head where this is what's the most most important and this is what's not as important like love is important but if you see two people that are you know they're in love but you don't like either one of them you do you feel like that's the same kind of love as two people you admire that're together yeah right like how many people who do you know like all right I'll give you one I do lared Hamilton and Gabrielle ree I'm friends with those two people they're super athletes she was a super athlete in volleyball and he's like one of the the greatest big wave surf the world's ever known I'm friends with them and when I talk to them if I talk to them either on like we do a little fa we do a little FaceTime the other day and and I get out of it I go that I want to be somebody who makes me feel or or I want to be somebody who makes somebody feel the way I feel when I talk to them that's cool when I talk to those people I'm like these are superior people like lared Hamilton's a weird dude but he's also like a superior human Who does these crazy pool workouts with like 70 lb dumbbells he gets in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] sa at 250° and rides an aird bike with oven Ms on Jesus yeah they're freaks he wears oven mitts cuz it burns his hand yes 250 250 you eat at some point he was like I got to put on oven mitts but he doesn't get out of soda and I I said to myself when I got off the phone with them the other day um they're really nice people they're really really they're genuine people and this is one of the things that happens and it's a weird thing that happens when you become uh more and more famous you get more and more comfortable talking to other famous people you know see talk talk to famous people and you realize oh they have a hard time talking to people because other people think they're weird yeah so they have to find famous people that are also nice right and so that's how I feel about them so I get off the phone with them and I'm like like you can be you could be Gabriella AR and you can be lared Hamilton and still come out and be a really cool friendly inspirational genuine person I'm like I want to make somebody else feel the way those people make me feel yeah man and that's what I felt like I love that that's the best thing we can do for each other that's the answer and that's like if if anything has ever coming out of this podcast that's been good it's that it's given people a perspective where there's a potential where that maybe they're limited ideas of what they're capable of in terms of their own personal happiness or their own success and whatever their chosen Endeavor is maybe it's not really limited maybe they can just shift their Consciousness and through effort and focus they can change their Destiny maybe it's true well you know the reason I say centralization is because like the first a very natural reaction to being associated with a body would be that you would centralize on the identity that you're in you know if I step on your if I stomp on your foot you're going to feel pain so why wouldn't you centralize on this identity that you're in so and again like right now with the science we have it can't show us what I think it will eventually show that our sentience isn't limited the to the body that we're a field of Consciousness that's kind of getting associated with like particular like Quantum clouds of meat that we and they interface with other sensient bodies in a way that makes them unique to the relationship between that person like I bet you're different with your wife than you are with anybody you've ever met well that that is true and yes but that's also like one of the great like right now one of the big Ideas it's such a cool idea too is like on stage offstage so uh how are you acting when you think you're on stage in other words like when you're in front of like this is the best part about Co there's no on stage anymore exactly that's it but it's the only good thing about Co for me well there there's a actually I'll tell you some other great things about Co it taught us out that we can tell a commutant businesses still work and that CH transforms the landscape but like the the the onstage offstage idea or or the way like choim chime puts it is some people at the end of the day they go home and they sit on the couch and they go and but they only let themselves do that at the very end of the the day of work because they've produced in their mind a situation where this is me relaxing and this is me working right here I am with my family here I am with my co-workers here I so this differentiation produces a kind of neurotic kind of uh like split personality uh way of being which is like really all those you don't need to wait to get home to sit on the couch to go that's where you're at now like that's actually every single thing but the story you're telling yourself produces moments where this is a relaxing time and this is a non-relaxing time but it's just a story Joe that that's the idea and like compassion is like I think the the beginning of recognizing like you know how many people have you met I'm sure and I know my life changed when I went to the doctor with my swollen [\\xa0__\\xa0] testicle that by the way before I went to the doctor I would look at myself in the mirror and think man if there were symmetrical I would feel awesome like it felt good to have a big ball there was like I literally was like God damn it if they were you were happy about the one big ball it looked powerful I'm not going to lie man have you ever seen Joey Diaz's balls yeah like that like the way Preposterous he feels like that every day they don't even make sense so like for a few months I Jamie have you seen Joey's balls see if you can pull up the picture of Joey on stage where he's naked with a with a uh he had a um can't show I know I know but just for me he had a uh a safety pin and a towel around his neck like a cape and this is for my 1999 Warner brother's CD called I'm going to be dead someday we took these crazy pictures in the main room at The Comedy Store dude I was there you were there for those The Matador outfit I was like there was some drama about it that you guys snuck in and took the pictures were you working you work was a talent coordinator you guys snuck in took the pictures you didn't no we didn't snuck in we had a we talked to whoever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] it was was it was it Scot day or tomm I'm sorry I feel like I was there when I happed I could be wrong but I remember the Matador pictures Warner Brothers did it maybe I'm wrong made calls no I remember thead door picture was real I'm sorry but I remember a moment that I was I think I was a talent coordinator where suddenly Joey there's pictures of Joey Diaz in a matador outfit they the funniest thing you ever seen But mity caught wind of it that's what I remember is there was some drama around the situation like the pictures themselves were like not just funny they were like kind of artistic they look cool there's a picture of Joey and he please someone find this it's in I think I have the CD so I have it if it's on the C it's on the CD so I have it cuz I I you know when I'm moving I'm going through my [\\xa0__\\xa0] and one of the things I found is those old uh I'm going to be dead someday CDs that's 99 I became Joey Diaz uh associate and best friend around 96 that's when I metad at him so like could that when I was there I just remember there was some drama no you might have been there if you were there in 99 I I you start working I don't remember I don't remember the exact day and again like I don't remember I just remember there was some drama around I think it was before your time man I want to feel like it's before your time dude it could easily be that mity caught wind of the pictures late or something you know it like it could easily I just remember there was some drama attached to the that lady was so nice to me she loved you man she loved Joey too she Lov both of us she had the the the the funnest thing with like her idea of us together she loved that we were together that we were friends she she was a wild she was a wild lady she was wild dude that was a real Guru like MIT Shore was an actual Guru yeah listen man I I tell everybody if there's one human being that's the most important human being in comedy ever that wasn't a comedian it's MSY Shore that's why she's on the wall of this room she was a I'm taking her with me man not only that the movers don't take her I take her M mi's coming with me on the plane yeah man she was real listen that's coming with me on the plane no [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah like the reason why that's up on the wall after the movers have gone is that's coming with me that's mity yeah she gave me my my future no she was wild she was a wild she was a crazy lady she's a perfect person to run The Comedy Store well no she had to be that way you know you could you can't make you can't have the if you go through there's photos in the album where you can see Joey with his uh with a cape he had this uh I oh godamn I know I can I know I have it I know I have it somewhere I'll find it it's on one of my folders you know what was in her when you walk into her house Joey Diaz Cape balls looking you know you know what was in her house on dhini when you walk into her house that so on her house when you walk in the first thing you see is what do you call it when people sew and they make art with sew crochet a crocheted picture and on it it said dying is easy comedy is hard that's the first thing you said eyes are yeah yeah and it like and it's true and like that that was what beautiful about her is she understood how hard comedy was I told you the story of her getting robbed right I told you that story which story is that tell me so like here's how cool she was and I I can't remember the name of the comic but she was giving him spots I can't remember the name of the comic this was in the early when it's better you don't tell it's better I don't say so this [\\xa0__\\xa0] needed money and he robbed the van she was in the van like apparently she he he like at gunpoint took the cash earnings of the of the club at gunpoint like took the money from her and she knew who it was somehow she could tell somehow from The Mask he didn't do good she just knew right and I remember her saying like yeah he uh he robbed me at gunpoint but he's funny but he's funny he that was her but that was her like can you imag like if you really think about it you get robbed at gunpoint by a comedian and you still give him stage time what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is that well that's a that's a guru that's a guru that's not a h that's not a normal person anymore that becomes like that I I've never had that sort of an relationship with any human ever you know I I sought her out when I was living in Boston really yes you knew about her dude when I was an open micer okay I had gotten obsessed with comedy for 6 months before I could ever do it open mic night cuz I erroneously assumed that you had to be 21 to be able to get on stage it turns out you can be younger but you just can't drink they watch you but you can be a 19-year-old do stand up I didn't know so August 27th 1988 when I turned 21 I went on stage and when when I went on stage I remember thinking I remember like really clearly thinking like how weird is this job there's a there's a bunch of people out there that can just talk and they can make a living yeah how weird is this job what did you think the first time you ever went on stage and you talked into a microphone hello hi my name is Duncan Trussell so weird like when you look back at those times like how do you feel you feel like it's not even you I met that lady when I met Mitsy Shore and when NY Shore passed me at The Comedy Store I remember thinking when I was in 1988 in Boston that there was this Mecca there was this place you had to go where Richard Pryor filmed live at the sunset trip and Sam Kennison used to stand up yeah and [\\xa0__\\xa0] hoe Mandel went up and Rodney Dangerfield and David Letterman godamn I got to get to The Comedy Store that's all they wanted to do I didn't want to get anywhere else there was one part of me that wanted to go to Houston cuz I had heard that like Sam kenneson did these wild shows in Houston I want to go to Houston but the the big thing for me was I got to get to the store and when I got passed by that lady dude you know it's one of the reasons why I feel so compelled to help people on this podcast it's cuz I feel like when that lady passed me I was like holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] like I'm a real comedian now like I don't have to be scared I just have to keep working I I got pasted yeah by the Godmother the real godmother yeah and like you worked for that lady that's right you were there all the time man I know can't go back she she made us she she created an environment that accelerated comedy yeah man she pushed comedy cuz she kept it together but like at the [\\xa0__\\xa0] highest RP like a 9,000 RPMs of the engines going she kept it together she let these Comics be wild remember you remember when Ari slapped Bobby Lee of course I remember do you know that's when he started getting spots is that true yeah you know how I know cuz I was jealous I was a talent Ari like like I remember Ari's gradually unraveling into his comedic self and like I remember like Ari smacks Bobby Lee I don't remember there's a fight between Ari and Bobby Lee and I remember as the talent coordinator that was when Mitzy start he's now a comic somewhere in that like in that like throwing off of rationality and that I don't know what it was man like in you know you the here's the most important part of mity she was a woman she was a woman and she encouraged chaos she wasn't in remotely concerned with safety she wanted wild people man she wanted dude she wanted me to be wild that's what she wanted she wanted wild comedy she wanted Kennison she wanted prior she wanted everyone that came in between Damon way yeah man she wanted she wanted wild she wanted Martin Lawrence she wanted wild she yeah she wasn't domestic MIT she was feral mity was a feral lady Mitzy was a human I mean that what we call human now people think of as pharoh or what people no I mean I mean but when I say pharoh I mean exceptional she was wild she didn't have anybody else's rules holding her back no she didn't and she didn't [\\xa0__\\xa0] care she didn't care she didn't care about money she [\\xa0__\\xa0] you that's the most important thing about her is like having a club on the Sunset Strip and not making decisions based on money yeah cuz let me tell you man as a talent coordinator there were plenty of times where people wanted to film some [\\xa0__\\xa0] in the main room where they wanted to pay a lot of money and she' be like no get it no tell them the [\\xa0__\\xa0] well we should talk about that cuz that was like one of the things about that club was that like you could never film anything there no that was one of the most amazing things about Ari filming his special there it was a really cool thing he did it was also like an acknowledgement that the world had changed and that was one of the reasons why I was willing to come back it's cuz Ari filmed his [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah in the O well she would have I I really do believe she would have approved that avenge sure but somebody would have got involved they would have [\\xa0__\\xa0] it up she would have made him jump through some hoops it wouldn't have been that easy like she would have made him do some crazy and she's right here's the thing she's right you know I didn't I didn't cash any of my checks you probably know that oh I remember I don't like when I was working at the store I just wouldn't cash my checks and then at the they would go hey we have like all this money that you I just like can I donate it to the sound system you bought the sound system there I did that too but that was that was extra that was on top of that cuz the sound system was [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and then you bought it and honestly mity didn't want you to do that because like that was the thing like she re she was smart enough to know if I let a comedian buy the sound system I can't like honestly give them spots like so she I knew that was the case but I was like at this point she's giving me spots every [\\xa0__\\xa0] weekend I just want to help out let's not stop playing games like come on you know what I'm doing I'm out here doing my best stand up I can this we got a [\\xa0__\\xa0] up speaker system let's fix it I put I put a DAT system in there I put a mini disc and I wanted to have it set up so anybody could like if you had a mini disc remember the mini disc days of course dude it was so important before smartphones to be able to record your shows yeah it's so big and you don't record and listen to all of them but the option to be able to do that is so huge even if you're not diligent you still gain like 10 20 20% of like a tightening of your act dude The Comedy Store at that time for lack of a better word was an art cult yeah that's what it was it was a cult and like it was a cult that was like for sure ba like all cult systems are based on like a strong charismatic central leader it was mity but you know what as a man I was uh happy to relent to MSY well yeah thing but there was a thing for me as like this macho man it was important it was important to relent to mity you had to but it wasn't just that I had to I wanted to to show respect to show that I I got it to show that I know what you did yeah man like that lady man when I was in [\\xa0__\\xa0] Boston in ' 88 I would hear about her she loved comedy one lady did this like yeah she was married to a comedian but it didn't work out and she's paully Shore's mom and I would hear these stories and I'd be like that's crazy this one lady just figured it out and she was wild and she liked the party and she like man and she was just a wild lady but she was brutal with you she didn't like your comedy she would just tell you you were done she would just tell you if she thought you weren't funny you were done dude she put her hand on my wrist she goes you're really funny and I'll never forget that it was like 1994 I was like oh my god well she wouldn't hand that out lightly man that was the thing is like she was like that I've been around it like so it's so weird I I'm so lucky because I got to be around like Romos and Mitsy Shore and like they're similar in a way man yes they are similar yeah the there's a there's a lot of difference don't like this idea of what we think of as perspect perspective yeah dude 1994 when I was six years into comedy her putting her hand on my wrist and telling me I'm really funny changed my life look the to me the thing that like will never be captured is that it's not just that here you have this like tiny woman who is tiny tiny but it's not just that you have this being I would be so careful when I would hug her right remember hugging mity yeah yeah well she was a gangster I mean that was all like the thing about mity was like no like imagine like the the best thing to think of is like think of your most like Outlaw comedian then imagine a person who built a saloon within which those comedians could be grown to be more of an outlaw there was no Kennison without MSY Shore that's right but then the most to me like with mity if you were G and she would never allow this she'd already if she heard me saying any of this [\\xa0__\\xa0] she'd be like get fired but like if you were going to write a mity Bible that and you wanted to like base the whole Bible on one thing it was something she told me so many times as a talent coordinator and I liked to in fantasize she thought I was funny but as a talent coordinator something she told me over and over and over again regarding comedians was you don't need them they need you that was her like core thing which is like the moment that a comedian starts thinking that they need the system then they degrade themselves they have to understand that their comedic ability and who they are as that Persona which she would say is like they're iconic class she meant like you're not going to find anyone like this ever again and that's who she was trying to find she would say therefore you it's supply and demand which is like there is nothing like you but there's a lot of things like them so if you think that you need them you will degrade yourself as an artist that was her main core truth which is don't get caught up in the thing they're going to try to teach you which is you need them you don't need the manager you don't need the agent you don't need the studio you don't need anything cuz you're are funny you're the [\\xa0__\\xa0] nuclear isotope generating energy and if you get lost in this Insanity that you require the system to be great not only do you grade yourself you to great in art but you know this is one of the things about recognizing what MIT Shore did and a lot of Bud fredman a lot of people who own clubs Rody Dangerfield yeah is it's not just about the ideas and getting the ideas out in a way the audience can Digest it's setting up a club it's bringing people in it's setting a standard where people know hey man David Letterman came out of here Robin Williams came out of here yeah okay Bill Hicks came out Bill Hicks was a [\\xa0__\\xa0] door man here Sam Kennison came out of here okay this is the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Comedy Store there's a standard and that's a factor too man you can't let the artists completely be in control because one charismatic artist with a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] song and dance moves can trick people into thinking things that aren't necessarily accurate because of Charisma that's true man like that's she figured that out though yeah and we need another one of her man I mean like the thing you're never going to get another mity but we we can carry on her Legacy we we we all learned from her you know and I think she was uniquely qualified to run the comedy store because she wasn't a comic she had no no desire to be a comic but she was married to a comic and she knew exactly what Comics were her son was a comic yeah she knew exactly what Comics were and she wasn't stupid she was smart and she was she but she also didn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] like there's a there's a rare group of people that legitimately don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] if Mitsy Shore was alive today if we could somehow or another like go back in time and grab Mitsy Shore from 1974 and bring her to 2020 she would she would just be running [\\xa0__\\xa0] she would just be running [\\xa0__\\xa0] first of all she would have like a hundred girls under contract for like only fans accounts she would just run people I'll tell you the one time that part that part's not true the only fans the only fans I it's conjecture but I'll tell you the one you have a problem with only fans the porn site it's not a porn site though it's like girls can do whatever they want I don't have a problem with sex like I like I have a problem with my own inability to like regulate my desire to come but like I can't get mad at the world for that like that's had a conversation with some with someone and they were saying well also she has an only fan site I'm like H if I had big tits I'd be like getting paid for those big tits I'm so tired of these sex negative [\\xa0__\\xa0] man they ramped up when the lockdown though cuz it became of course it should easy job for a lot of people if I was 22 and I had big tits and I like to do squats and I was sitting around thinking do I do I want to work at Burger King or do I want to shake my ass for 10 bucks a month for 35,000 guys yeah it doesn't have to just be that though either it's not just a porn St you can do whatever you it's patreon for you know this is madness so only fans you can just do yoga but Joe in like a dimension where like being funny is getting people to come you would be like the top porn star in that Dimension it just that's a weird one right like getting people to come is so specific that's what's a big deal it doesn't matter it shouldn't be a big deal but yet it is like if you find out that somebody came it's not a big deal it shouldn't be but it is it is right now cuz we're lunatics like we hate life like we're in a exactly yeah we're we're we're we're we're so death Centric that like the anything that's the source of life which is a hand job a blow job [\\xa0__\\xa0] we look at that as like being depraved you know well it's it's really just some sort of weird Canyon ladder in between two [\\xa0__\\xa0] Cliffs between this and what is going to be available for people in just a few years there's going to be virtual sex you got to have Riley Reed on man she's so great like I had her on my fck you have her on and I'll take my pants off what I'm going to do is I she's so funny goggles on this this is the future goggles you put goggles on you lay back you're in another world well yeah I mean that's heaven but like but is it yes no what's wrong with coming because there's 1% of your brain that knows it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] why there's no real girl and they don't really like you and your jokes suck and you kind of smell and you didn't brush your teeth that good yeah yeah but she's like I love part of you no the girl oh no no no no no if the girl really did love that part of you that would be extraordinary see that's the beauty of alcohol alcohol is you're hanging out with a girl who's got a like Hello Kitty tattoo in between your thumb and forefinger and you guys are drinking you're having a good time and you're like I love you and she's like I love you too and you just give each other a hug it doesn't even have to be sexual that's where alcohol comes in where where what do you mean what do you mean I'm following you in the the Hello Kitty the where does that alcohol come in that's where alcohol comes in and like it allows you to take chances and hope that the other person doesn't have ulterior motives where you both release your Ambitions and run let's go to Vegas and get married I don't even know you let's go crazy how crazy is that we think fucking's bad it's not that we think fucking's bad it's that we worry you [\\xa0__\\xa0] too many people you got tricked too many times you're like one of those people at one of those David bla Street shows and you're like it's got to be the queen of hearts trust me isn't that wild it's like it's the great it's one of the great things it really is one of the great things like think of like anytime like you know why why because we're concentrated more on Innovation and progress in terms of numbers like but earning money and uh getting new projects pass through they take precedent over every everything else so sick it's weird but it's just a it's a weird game this is what I'm getting out of this book irresistible it's like there's things that we have in our head where we're we're we have these they're wrong we have these ideas of what we need in order to be sufficient like here's we're operating from the wrong principles wait I'm sorry Joe I got a I've been holding for like 10 minutes I'm sorry I don't want it to end man we don't have to end go P this is the first show ever on Spotify I can't believe I get to be here I gotta go I I looked on your your go I wasn't even in the Jesus go PE no voting he's there's no voting God that isn't he funny I wasn't even in the voting Duncan Trussell I wanted you to be guest number number one it's important guess number two Miley Cyrus that's right second one number two yeah that's what I said number two I said guess number two yeah you don't even listen we're like an old married couple Jamie it sound I said guest number two I'm drunk I'm high guest number two is Miley Cyrus guest number three Mike mother [\\xa0__\\xa0] Tyson how about that Jamie are you concerned at all about moving to Texas no that's what I like about you it's one of many things but you're ready to roll like I should just tell the people at home I brought it up with Jamie I'm like I'm thinking about moving to Texas Jamie goes okay is that accurate yeah I mean that's gonna happen something was coming some change something was happen what did you think was going to happen what was worst case scenario like Montana I no I didn't think that was GNA no I don't know I just didn't want you to not want to do it I wasn't worried about it good I'm happy there's uh you know it's hard feel like I'm prolonging this out of an neuro longing anything this is fun Jamie and I just had a Love Fest oh that's great I do feel like I'm I was asking Jamie if there's ever a time where I was telling him we're moving to Texas where he was like oh like I don't want to do that but he's like no but when I brought it up I'm like do you what do you think and he's like okay like that's cool I do feel like I'm stretching it out it's like man it mean man this is the first episode on Spotify I I love it's supposed to be you it's supposed to be you it's beautiful but also there's a piece of me that I think we can work things out together I really do I think you and me together have a unique perspective and I'm not [\\xa0__\\xa0] I agree and I don't think it's I'm not taking ownership and you shouldn't either it's the the two of us together I know there's a weird thing that happens I feel it man like look it's my favorite thing which is why I don't want it to end which is why I'm like I like to like look man I'm a Bo I know I'm going to die what does that mean though when you say you're a a Buddhist shouldn't we have a new thing you said like communism socialism I love it Joe I love it can't we have a new one I think we can but I do want to like the reason I'm going to speak up for Buddhism in general and I agree with you and what I love about Buddhism so much is that man what's great about it is it invites you to reject it it says to you the first part of it is like reject this if you can like if you can find a flaw in the thing reject it and and also if you can find a like legitimate rejection then we will add that to the like what Buddhism it's of Buddhism yes so that's what I love about it because it's more of a process that's that's perfect yeah it's perfect and it has to be that way it has to be that way if you're thinking about how to progress with ideas yeah man you have to be able to say hey bring me a counter idea that makes more sense and I'll reconsider it but it's what we were talking about earlier people are married to their goddamn ideas it's sad it's it's it's not just sad it is sad for sure but it's also it's bad for all of us and it's it's one of those things that we should recognize just like you know like uh negative feedback like oh I'm so fat oh I'm such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] loser everybody admits that that is not good for you and it actually hinders process and I progress I think that it hinders progress as well I think we have to look at things in a more positive way that's so weird dude I like it I was there's this teacher Jack cornfield he's so smart he's a Buddhist teacher and I remember like in the early days of the ramdas Retreats I would do these podcasts with him and I remember being like I want to get in shape I feel like I'm fat and what he said to me was get in shape because you love yourself not because you hate yourself don't get in shape because because you are uh angry at who you are right now get in shape because you think you deserve to be in shape that's cute that sounds like gu never been fat listen to me [\\xa0__\\xa0] hey he's not a [\\xa0__\\xa0] competition's real [\\xa0__\\xa0] sometimes you just got to get in shape cuz you don't look at fat shaming works this what people don't like to admit that that shame makes you [\\xa0__\\xa0] lose weight cuz you don't want to feel bad and then you feel good because you lost all the weight I have to stick up for Jack cornfield because he is one of the great teachers I'll stick up for him too and you would love him and you would you would love I love him if he's friends with you I love him thank you Joe but I do have to stick up for him but just just like an example of how badass this person is do you want to move to Texas no I can't I'm going I I'm not saying are you sure I don't want to be local I have an idea I think you and I together can fix a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] what's the plan man you and me do like a weekly podcast one a week Joe and Duncan I love it live from Austin I love it but it's not going to happen in Austin why not oh we'll Zoom for a while until you come to your senses listen man we'll do it off camera this conversation I love this conversation though listen man I'm not bullshitting I'm not bullshitting I would do just about anything for you Joe I would do just about anything for you I know you would I would now look I got to stick up for this teacher though and I'm we can zoom it we can zoom it hold on what teacher Jack cornfield Joe bu guy yeah I love you man I love you too but you got to understand this is like a person has deeply impacted me and and like he was a monk and I know him as a friend and like he's a monk okay in the sense that he went here's what's cool about him he went to he became a monastic terab and Buddhist and he like took a vow of silence for like two years so for two years he didn't talk is it possible he didn't have anything good to say oh no no man Jack corfield look look listen I I really like he really like I'm sorry I don't mean to be sentimental about somebody joking I know you're joking when did he die he's alive Joe sorry sorry sorry you said sentimental I panicked I mean sentimental only in that like I wouldn't want to do anything that would like negatively impact like a real can we get him on a show first you me and Jack cornfield you would love it you how about that our first episode that convinces you to move to Austin Texas I would I would come to Austin Texas to Jack no what if I bought you a house would you live in it Joe I love that you would buy me a house but I wouldn't move is that it's cool about us like one of the cool things about us is you could say I will buy you a house that's not why I would want to be with you for the house or I know I know man and I understand but like for me it's like I will off camera I will talk to you about the reason we made the decision oh listen you made an amazing decision your decision is way better than mine but I don't I'm jealous I don't want be local like to me like I get it let's do a zoom show let's do a zoom show or let's you and I have known each other for so long we could do both or either exactly we could do Zoom shows we could do live shows I just think like the the right now the best thing for the world is not to imagine that you have to be in any given GPS coordinate I think that yeah the best thing for the world is to begin to realize like we don't need to be Tethered to a a a a particular locality like this is the problem is like it's it's a bit of the problem but it's also in recognizing that it is an actual like it's a thing that you factor into the world that you see but how relevant is it to day-to-day operations right that's what I'm talking about like that's the to me like the gift of Co has been like people have begun to realize like keep your circle small Google is doing fine and no one's going to Google to go to work Twitter is doing fine no one's going to the Twitter building to work Netflix are they do they have jobs dude people are all working remotely no one's going to Netflix Oh what you're saying is that the businesses are doing well but no one's going to the the actual business they don't have to why do they have to exactly dude that that to me that is the if you want to like start really like restructuring Society let's start with a Superstition that you need to be in in in like a like proximity of another person's body God damn that kills New York City yeah it kills La too it kills La it kills La that's why I want you to come to Austin dude I will be at whenever you want I'll come to Austin D no come bring your baby ah he would love I can't wait for you to meet little Forest he's so brilliant but but my point is look man my point is like we can't be centralized like look you're going to be in Austin I'm going to be in a certain place I don't want to say yet it's a bunker outside of Nevada somewhere near Baro where the bats take over we're going to fight against centralization so that we don't have to get chained to shitty cities like that's the whole point is like look if anything happens after Co that's beautiful it will be that all the commuters say to their bosses wait a minute for the last six months I've been zooming in for these [\\xa0__\\xa0] conferences and your business is doing just as well as it did when I was driving an hour to get there an hour back and then the moment that happens we break the back of addiction to being in a metropolis now we have a global Society now it's not just that you have to have some person who's like living in an Angelino it's like you could have someone from any part of the planet centralization seems to be the fundamental problem in the sense that it was it worked we needed to centralize prior to the internet but now we don't need to centralize no one it's better for everybody if we take into account every idea it's better for everybody if we take into account all the dumb ideas and smart ideas and let them battle it out yeah let's find out who's right yeah and you got to be real careful people who think that they're right and the other people are wrong it's what we were talking about earlier that bums me out the most about the Democratic Convention is it I would just like forget about whatever you don't like about Trump tell me what you're GNA do don't tell me how bad the orange man is tell me what you're going to do yeah how you going to fix it how you going to fix it yeah what are you going to do what are you going to do about Flint Michigan's water what are you going to do about the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Earth is heating up what are you going to do about there no fish where's the fish what are you going to do yeah nobody has an idea they just want to talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] and make sure everybody's trans I would rather them talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] and make sure everyone's trans then be like what's happening now which is I don't mean that trans people I'm with you I know look you're here's what's funny to me about your whole like push back against the trans Community it's not it's only push back against trans people competing as females and fighting that's it and other Athletics a little bit but fighting in a big way to me the part of it that's like interesting is I know you well enough to know that if and you prove me wrong here but if there was a technology they could turn a guy into a woman no they could not just turn a guy into a woman which is very funny because right now that's what we're doing and it makes sense because it's like right now what we know is men and women right so that's where we're at so right now as far as our understanding of what can a human be if you want to break it into a binary we've got men and women right but that's pretty limited to me you know what I me and I get wanting to be a woman and I think that you Joe Rogan if there was a technology that could instantly turn you into a woman yeah you wouldn't hesitate to turn i' like to feel a dick inside me yeah exactly that's what I'm saying me as a woman yeah and I don't think it made me gay no exactly doesn't make you gay trust me if someone who's felt many dicks inside of them doesn't make you I'm just kidding if you could be a woman and actually be attracted to a male for 18 hours and you're in love imagine a second imagine if you have an Oculus Rift and uh yeah they make you go through a bunch of waivers and they say Duncan um if you do take the next step signed what happens is you become a woman who actually feels the way a woman feels when she's attracted to a man a guy with a dick like a battering ram let me try he just going to send it home see what happens and you can't wait you want to feel him come inside your upper rib cavity like want to feel it sign me up yeah who cares the point is like you would do some men the weakest Among Us would be scared of that experience right they'd be scared that that experience weakens them and turns them into something that they they they dismiss but how hilarious is it that they sorry Joe no no it's it's their own issue no it's the the the experience that literally made them exist on the planet they feel like if they were to feel it it would be something against who they are which is insanity in the sense that the very see the very feeling of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] blowing come inside your body you switch spots with your woman imagine if the only way a woman was willing marry you is if you become the wife and she becomes the husband and you switch Consciousness it Duncan I love you I love you too Priscilla I want to know what it feels like to be you yeah I want to be with you yeah but I want I want to be you for four years yeah let's swap identities foure contract yeah we're all of your secrets get downloaded into your wife's brain let's swap he likes feet that's not a secret imagine though that no that's the idea is like the point is like right now we're like terrestrialization funny to me about like Lindsey Graham I love Lindsey Graham he's such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] but I I feel for I feel a weird connection to him he's such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] but like Lindsey Graham I have the feeling that if suddenly there was like the ability to travel through space he would leave the planet within seconds he would just be gone the lindsy gramy was like here's what I think about religious guy no he's a politician Lindsey Graham is this like like piggish is any religion he's like poor Lindsey grah man he's like he like got he has a weak chin I have a weak [\\xa0__\\xa0] chin man yeah D I shave my beard no listen bro that guy no Lindsey Graham look I know Lindsey Graham he like got sucked into a dark Vortex he's a sweetheart Underneath It All and also he's like he's like a gay dude you know he's like a gay dude who like has but what I'm saying is like what is he saying what he's a gay dude that has like a lindsy Graham causes problems because he a gay dude that what he like is a he's a he's a suppressive being that like is like aligns with closet no not a closeted thing it's not the gay dude is in the part the the it doesn't matter if Lindsey Graham's gay that's all what I'm saying you brought it up so it must matter no what I'm saying is like his [\\xa0__\\xa0] came out about him being gay and like then he had to fight it or like there was like some I felt bad for in that regard I feel bad about but don't you think for him even like it would be if he just said said I'm gay yeah be the best or I'm not like that's that's the argument against these two ideas if you could turn into a woman and get [\\xa0__\\xa0] like you just said would you be gay it's good question bro no you would just be a woman who got [\\xa0__\\xa0] but like somehow if like you're if you've decided to centralize on your masculine identity and someone [\\xa0__\\xa0] you now you're gay the whole like conceptualization of gayness and straightness it's just monkey talk is the problem the word itself the problem is a binary it's like the definition who like it's a trait it's a binary dude it's like look I don't know I like whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] it is that you think is like limiting your ability to experience pleasure on the earth is Satan and it's like if that thing is telling you that you're a dude and this is the only way you can feel Joy but on the like simultaneously you're like hanging out with a guy who's like the same gender as you and your fall in love with him and then you're you're pretending you're not because because like some devil voice in your mind is telling you that's Satan man that's evil that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] evil it's dark it's dark and I'm not like deriding Lindsey Graham's sexual proclivities I'm just saying you know he's not actively gay I don't know that all I'm saying is like when I why you shaming him I'm not shaming lindsy gr I feel like you are no I'm not I'm saying if I feel like it' be nice if you admit your privilege I hope Lindsey grandma is listening to this cuz I'm not insulting you my friend you could hear from my voice that I'm not insulting you I'm just saying H darkness my old no Joe I'm telling you if lindsy grah could fly off the planet he would that's what I think I would he fly off the planet with a man's mouth on his penis who wouldn't I would do that in a second I don't care who it is if that I don't care if it was what fueled the spaceship or didn't that would be amazing why wouldn't you do that who how awesome would that be imagine if it was the mountain from Game of Thrones that guy's blowing you as you fly through space and your orgasm extends to Eternity yeah the whole like gay straight thing really falls apart Pink Floyd I wish you were here s of Silence I was trying to work it in there but can't find the but you the gay stay thing falls apart if we stop being terrestrial like the moment you're not on the planet anymore it's all planetary based memes man it's like the moment we're like released from the gravity well all the stuff that seems so important to dumb asses which is like what you you [\\xa0__\\xa0] you would put your mouth on a penis you must be crazy imagine if it felt amazing imagine like man never blow a [\\xa0__\\xa0] guy and you get that dick in your mouth and the moment that sperm hits your tongue it's like Pop Rocks yeahp pop and your brain goes oh you and I man we will suckle on a we will suckle on a mucus thing that's like a like this vag we'll do that we pride we pride ourselves on it we pride our water park slide that's what I love so much about Christina Pit's Instagram she does these like [\\xa0__\\xa0] hilarious Tik Tock clips that she recovers from Tik Tock and there's a whole genre of Tik Tok of these creepy [\\xa0__\\xa0] perves who are like showing how they lick [\\xa0__\\xa0] and like the whole Tik Tok is based on them like going it's so [\\xa0__\\xa0] up but it's like a guy will in the masculine sense will go down on a girl yet the concept of having a dick in your mouth is considered to be like [\\xa0__\\xa0] up like you must be like a complete like you something about you is weak you know and I think we're going to have to contend with that as what's this uh that's the dude what's he doing he does like how like he like watch just you got to watch him man what he do I don't know I just I just checked her this guy does like like eating [\\xa0__\\xa0] Tik toks that's what he's doing yeah watch watch just watch this one doesn't do he like he like eases into it her by the way her Instagram the Tik Tok she does like she should do a whole show based on her like she she like curates the most [\\xa0__\\xa0] up Tik toks you've ever seen isn't that important like Tik Tok whether it's Tik Tock or Instagram or any of these things isn't that important just random one I do that it kind of is right it kind like lowering the boundaries like uh dropping down the boundaries for people to be able to enter into the world of expressing whatever weirdo idea they have or a video of them doing back flips onto a [\\xa0__\\xa0] whale whatever they're doing yeah yeah it's the B I I like I don't like Tik Tok in the sense that like my wife she's into Tik Tok and I don't like it because she's always looking at Tik Tok and then I'll be like really you're looking at Tik Tok and she'll be like you're on Twitter all day long you should get off Twitter you should read this book I hate Twitter this book irresistible it's a mindblower man it really is because it it lets you realize that as much as we're at each other's throats right now I don't know how much of it is our fault and I think we could have been a lot better off if someone decided instead of trying to make money that they would recognize that this uh strategy of uh whether it's social media likes or Twitter you know Twitter Twitter or Facebook or whether it's showing you the things you get angry about and you comment on on Facebook or YouTube like whatever we're doing like ultimately we're changing the path the way people think we're way more valuable than we like to think we are way more and I think people that have a voice whether it's you or I or Ari or bird or Tom or anybody who has a podcast in particular because if you have a podcast at the very least no one's telling you what you can't talk about no one's Duncan I I love that segment but when you're talking about people like not conforming and trying to figure themselves out people think you're nonbinary or somehow or another you're like you're like you're not woke sorry I'll repeat what I said I'm sorry I'll revise we're in the middle of a storm Duncan yeah well we what the main thing the most important thing I think in the storm and it's easy to forget is is that like you and I and everybody we run across I've yet to meet somebody who's a real monster man there's a few but even them they just need hug they're also very unique when you run across it's very unique and like the anytime I feel like this is where I'm like I'm attuned to this anytime I get the sense someone's wanting me not to express myself that's where I get really locked in and really like and I get the whole like anti-woke thing because nobody wants some [\\xa0__\\xa0] liberal Baptist piece of [\\xa0__\\xa0] to tell them how to be but you know man like the moment I'm on my Instagram I did a black lives matter thing that's the only time anybody told me to shut up no one told me to shut up before that but the moment I did a thing that was in alignment with like black lives matter there was all of a sudden like this weird similarity of people hitting me up being like you you [\\xa0__\\xa0] woke me there was a lot of of blowback from that and and also when when you say a lot like how many enough that like like I noticed it and right but if you tuned in at a hug part like 30 messages how many messages no not 30 just enough where I really 10 I'm going to say like five 15 15 enough where like I realize how many Instagram followers do you have I don't remember dude I can look it up right now like not 200,000 or something I a lot of people man no but but I know what you're saying but it was like I realized that like my thinking regarding being like even remotely an a political activist was being shaped by my fear that a tiny percentage of my audience would reject me and that's what I'm saying it's like I was letting my ship get steered not by my own Intuition or Not by my my own sense of like [\\xa0__\\xa0] man like that [\\xa0__\\xa0] George Floyd video that's unforgivable that just [\\xa0__\\xa0] up but you know it's it's it's both it's unforgivable any man that would do that to another man like that man needs help I I bet he didn't think he was going to kill that guy but he tortured that guy for 8 minutes and 46 seconds it's like that guy needs he needs uh he needs a DMT trip he needs something he needs to recognize who he is killer he it's also Duncan I think I think we're asking people to do things they're not really qualified to do they don't have the tools to handle it they don't have the infrastructure to handle the load of pressure that comes in I just feel like all these people that and then right now we're we're so anti- cop it's like it's over the top well look man what I love about you is that you're like not afraid to say a thing like that and like I think if we're going to go if we're going to move forward right now we need cops but no if we're going to move forward what what we need is not just cops we need passion like that that the what if we're going to move forward what we need is it's like look man you're you're right this country was completely founded on human trafficking you're right that uh your your idea that like the the way like uh if you're if you have a a particular complexion in this country [\\xa0__\\xa0] is immediately against you you're completely right about that you're right like the thing is is like this is the problem is like and I think this is an important question for everybody to ask themselves is how do you act when you're right that's how that's how you can really tell a person you know what I think honestly I think we are looking for change the way we see change in oursel like we see a potential for changing oursel we see something wrong we go I got to correct that and then we think that Society can do that too but Society is like a battleship it's like a 500 M long Steel struct structure that has [Applause] to planes land on it it it's yeah that's it that's it that's a good description it's got to turn so and then people like [\\xa0__\\xa0] you we don't like people from [\\xa0__\\xa0] muslim countries yeah right [\\xa0__\\xa0] you trans women are real women yeah right and it's this battle to try to like navigate this enormous metal structure through the [\\xa0__\\xa0] ocean right that's where we're at that's where we're at that's why you got to do a podcast with me Duncan anytime I'll do anything for you man got to work this out we can work it out I mean the answer Jamie I'm not wrong right no but the answer is compassion Joe lot ways to do it no this is what I'm thinking you and I have a very unique frequency yeah let's do it this is why it's important because when you and I get together and I I firmly believe you and I can do this every godamn week I love it especially if we only saw each other once a week it's the best I'll fly you in I'll F come to Austin once Zoom we can zoom we can do whatever I'll fly to North Carolina I'm not going there I'm going to Colorado baby I met chuba yeah man like I I love it Joe I I mean I to me like you know that's what I think so great about the fact that you got to be the person that you are that you got to be the the spotlight got to be on you as it is and the reason it's on you and the reason I take such I really like not much offends me man but when people start attacking you I do like I have to fight against my offense because I know you and so when people are [\\xa0__\\xa0] at Arms against you I feel really depressed because I know you and I and you like you are one of the most Progressive people I've ever met and so when you when people start falling upon you uh because you have like [\\xa0__\\xa0] nerds like Ben Shapiro which by the way you shouldn't have that guy anymore he's a d come on come on those conversations are important I think what's beautiful about what you're doing is you're opening I would not open up the the by the way Ben Shapiro Underneath It All I know that you and I would probably have fun but I know that right now where you're at in your Incarnation you're a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dork and the you know what I mean like he's a DK he's a d but what's so confusing nice guy but what that's what's confusing about him is cuz you you look at his like you look at him and you're like he's all like beating up what's her face about the thing and that embarrassing thing the the the music video he's like and they were doing fornication did you see me and Alli makovsky talking about wet ass [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh God like like that thing Shapiro's do it's so embarrassing Joe and like that dude is like an embarrassment but the what I I don't think what people admit when they look at Ben Shapiro it's like there's a piece of you that's like I I'd have fun with him like it' be fun to drink with him he's probably cool but he's like right now I don't think he drinks but he's a nice guy he's a what whatever it is he he's a good person I'm not bullshitting I look again I think our job right now is not to alienate we have to like involve and that's why I have him on that's that's why I know you're doing it Joe he's a I'm telling you right now Ben chapiro is a nice man he's a nice man I see him I hug him every time I see him and I don't hug him to be fake I hug him cuz I genuinely love that guy I think he's a nice guy look I think some of the stuff he's propagating and his like philosophies is like legitimately deranged bro he's wearing an outfit it's a costume he's got I mean he Ben shapir could never take off the yamaka shave his head tattoo his chest with an eagle right wear a bikini he's got an outfit I just want but it's not his fault I'm telling you we all come from a different spot we if if life is a race it's not like everybody's on the same starting line like people are on starting lines they're like a mile behind your they're so far away they're all different and they here's the thing even if people are wrong about many things or even I'll explain this better even if you disagree with the way people feel about so many different things it doesn't mean you can't be their friend it doesn't and I'm telling you we got it wrong sweet here's what's important what's important is whoever that person is they got to be sincere now as soon as you feel like someone's a grifter yeah you got to cast them out right you got to cast them out cuz they got to figure that out on their own and they got to apologize that's cool man you got listen you can be wrong but you have to be honest and if you're just bullshitting then I can't hang out with you dudey let me ask you Shapiro is not bullshitting I don't think he's bullshitting I just think he's like a little like Antiquated in his IDE look man I I like I'm not like the whole Ben shapir thing like that's of all your guests is the one he a great guy man if you met him if you and I and him went to a steak dinner we'd have a great conversation I I hung out with him at the um the what's that steakhous the bo boa boa in Hollywood down the store from the store on Sunset I had a great time with him he's a good man I don't care I I like genuinely like him a lot when he texts me benir texts me I look at my pH on my bench I like that guy I like him I look as far as I'm concerned if you're going to create what I think could be created by Humanity we have to create the engine not of rejection but of acceptance which meaning that like if you got a charismatic fin shapir Avatar in the video game in the simulation that we're in there's a way to reabsorb him into reality that isn't like the way people currently see him if he's willing to relinquish his ideology and he has a very strict religious ideology yeah he's stuck in this little thing but I think that's helped him that little thing look if you figure out a way to do something that helps you past most of the people that you're competing against But ultimately hinders you against the people the people who learn your lessons plus other lessons and aren't hampered by ideology and they pass you like you have to there's a moment where you have to figure out when you're going to let go he seems to have a very like clear mind that's what's cool about him he seems to like have a very insightful mind I like that I just feel like something about him it like smacks of like the Nazi intellectuals yes it does but he's Jewish and here's the thing I love when people get mad at me that I talk to them I'm like listen just listen to what we're saying listen he's not a bad guy he might not agree with him but me and him are having really really good conversations about why I feel like you can't tell an 18-year-old kid just pull your pants up and don't shoot anybody yeah we're having these like really nuanced conversations and he's allowing me because he knows I like him so you're like the Bohemian GFF but it's no he knows I like him like Ben chapiro and I don't agree on many things but he knows if I see him I go what's up man how you doing I hug him and it's genuine I really care about him that's the whole point that's the whole point so if we care if he and I are sitting like right here and we talk about stuff he knows that if I don't agree with him I it's I doesn't change my feelings about whether or not I'll hug him or I love him that's it that's it yes that's the problem we're all facing we're all facing this problem where we identify with ideas whereas I think I think we can just do our best to make good with where we stand right now as a human and when we encounter other humans let's take IDE ideas and put them in front of us and Let's cross our arms and let's go over these ideas without any attachment that's where it gets hard because most of us don't have enough personal satisfaction and our own accomplishments to relinquish this idea that our ideas are not ours that our ideas are just it's just a mathematical problem it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Rubik's Cube it's a it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] game of Clue like who knows who did it is it Charlotte in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] library with a a rope we don't know so this thing that we're doing as people today is we're scared and one of the things that happened when people are scared is they pull back you pull back you you you you put up fences you wall off you protect your tribe your tribe gathers you decide what you can say what you can't say and decide who's the enemy and who's who's good and who's bad and and everybody walls off and my thoughts are are that's a trap and that is just something that we've been involved with forever from the beginning of time from single- cell organisms to small mammals to human beings we've been involved in this weird trap of competing against each other in the wrong way competing against each other in a way where ultimately somebody gets victimized I think the best competition is keeping the other competition alive competing against each other while helping each other and everybody gets by everybody gets better and even people who are not doing well you tell them why they're not doing well that will force you to do better right all of the people that trying to take your position if there's a ladder you say this is why you [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and then you'll do better cuz they'll do better and then everybody does better yeah there's no stagnation I get it it's just like the pro like you're in a you're in a like brutal position you're in a really brutal position like and no matter matter what I don't see how you can resist it like the problem with your your position is you have this like powerful voice that's the problem is like you're you're a signal booster and like I also got a NASA suit and I can hold my piss for four hours son how do you how have you not pissed but but but but to me like the the bizarre like the difficult situation you're in is like you get Ben Shapiro you signal boost that whatever that is I don't know what he is by the way he's not a bad guy I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to attack you your [\\xa0__\\xa0] like whatever the thing you did with like attacking the music video was [\\xa0__\\xa0] that was an embarrassment that was a mess that was a mess it was a mess I get it it was really sex negative it was so stupid he seemed like such a nerd a dork like and also anybody who's going to like do that you like feel like they they negate whatever their philosophical ideas by attacking the think gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] however he's doing the exact same thing that Trump does when he gets attention he's saying something about something that's culturally relevant and he's taking a contrary position and he's generating likes he's generating interest right he's like a a he's a he's a salesperson for negativity if I was his best friend and Ben and I were sitting around he's like you think you're supposed to like okay okay yeah you probably should cuz like ultimately people going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] with you but my my position is is it's better if you have vulnerabilities yeah if if there's something you've done that's really stupid it's probably better for you when you [\\xa0__\\xa0] on things yeah and I think that's a good argument for coming out against wet ass [\\xa0__\\xa0] that what's wrong with wet ass [\\xa0__\\xa0] by the way nothing nothing but a guy like Ben Shapiro he shouldn't be right too many times part part of his charm is his failure part of his charm is he casually he's got a say some [\\xa0__\\xa0] that only a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude with a yamaka says it's not that he's a bad person yaka there's a lot of jewi J's Jewish listen listen I love Ari but he doesn't wear a yamaka okay you're saying the yamaka means fundamentalism wear you don't have to wear it so now we're in space we're flying you've gone from rejecting here's us as a golf Bo flying through the universe C your impossible look man I don't I didn't want to get I don't care about [\\xa0__\\xa0] B shapir I don't care thank God you're the first episode on Spotify I don't care about leg four hours in who cares plus four I don't care about Ben shapir I don't care he should he's a nice guy who that's my No he cares listen if I hug Ben Shapiro I really hug him I love that guy he's a sweetie I'm sure he's a sweetie I meet him he's a nice guy look man it doesn't matter like here's a deeper Point man I and I don't mean to do this every time I'm on but you have such a such a crazy power that if you're not careful folks from deep dark Wells of perspective are going to infiltrate your [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude have you watched that great documentary on uh the like white Aryan folks man it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up like this dude why you got to go there give me that lighter here you go like yeah you you look at like these people are very organized man it's like they're organized is what I'm saying and like I'm and again I'm not saying Ben shapir as this person he wears a Yama he's Jewish what I don't know much about him I don't care I don't care listen to me listen to me all those people that are organized they come hang out with us give me a hug you don't want to give them a hug relax why just relax all those people are just people man like a white supremacist they were lost they imagine if you gave a white supremacist 5 Meo DMT and let him sit on a couch one of them brown suede couches they take three big hits and then as the first one as they're exhaling yeah yeah yeah and they get sucked into the center of the universe and they realize there is no Center cuz there is no boundaries it's all connected you're in a soup you're in an infinite soup of ideas and biology and thoughts and prayers and Love and Hope and happiness and jealousy and anal sex and it's all together who with cartoons and pop music and cheeseburgers who just a bunch of different experiences all [\\xa0__\\xa0] stitched together and some sort you're saying there's a Redemptive possibility and then the then the aliens land yeah look man this is the way I see it I don't know man who gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] like really it's like you know the the the the reality of it is is like we are in a very bizarre Peri period in time which is that you and I we became friends on the phone having these same conversations and now you say a thing that flies in the phase of the of the particular like default reality of our time and you start trending on Twitter you know like that's like some of our communic like the way I know you right now is like you trending on Twitter where I'm like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] happened but the jokes on them because I don't read Twitter you don't go on Twitter at all I don't read it I post things like today I posted Ali Letterman made some masks it's just poster masks Joe it's just weird because it's like you're like a but it's not me it's what they think I am it's who they decide to am yeah but you have to watch out cuz people are going to like try to exploit you that's the main thing is like people recognizing what you are who have political agendas will infiltrate your [\\xa0__\\xa0] and then start blowing out their radioactivity into the world right that's a fear radium like face rotten [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah yeah exactly like they'll get in they'll get in there and then like all of a sudden like you accidentally start exing [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's like that that you know you don't agree I know you don't agree with like Ben Shapiro listen it's not that I don't agree with Ben Shapiro and I definitely don't on many things and he and I talked about it it's said I don't want to abandon him oh that's that's cool I don't I don't think he's worthy of Abandonment CU I think he's a good person right and I think many of the things he said says he says cuzz he's rewarded for saying controversial things on the internet many times make sense and you know a logical way if you don't take into account all the different situations that lead to a person becoming who they are in 2020 right slavery and Jim Crow laws and all these different things we all have to deal with but I think he's a good person I really do I think many of times like the things we say were half defensive and and and and and half promotional you're saying things cuzz you think that people are going to react in a certain way you don't necessarily mean it and you also say things because you've seen the contrary to that poorly worded and you decide you don't agree with that and so you want to counter it but I think the problem is in ideal ideologies more than anything is if I'm really being objective I always feel like our problem is purely in ideologies because we just get committed to one side or the other and ideas to one side you're right or you're wrong and I think if we could just divorce oursel from ideas and divorce oursel from all ideologies and just look at something like honest like you come to me and I come to you and I go hey man what's up I go what are your intentions my my intentions is to live a harmonious life with my neighbors and I said might as well okay good beautiful and you hug each other and you go what do we have to do about tax man if we lived in a community where I felt like hey if I pay more in taxes people will have their kids in a better school and uh the water will be pure and you know there there be less crime I would [\\xa0__\\xa0] 100% sign up for that but I don't think the people that are taking that [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing and running with it know what they're doing that's right that's the problem you believe in the idea of democracy you just don't believe in the organ ganizational facility that's like administering democracy been to the red line of human beings I know where people fall apart I know the red line I know when the RPM's hit I know when people [\\xa0__\\xa0] out and I know I'm not going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] out and if you're going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] out I know I know you're if you're bitching out and you're also making you're making laws right what are you saying what what are you doing what's going on who are you why are you deciding what people do we shouldn't have any figureheads it's dangerous Alpha chimps are dangerous take it from me a person with a big platform you shouldn't listen to me you shouldn't listen to you you shouldn't listen to Bert ker shouldn't listen to Tom sagor Ari Safir AR Shir or Joey Diaz or name all the people you love to listen to Sam Harris don't listen to them meaning listen to their show but apply to whatever they say your own objective opinion but how weird is it that people will focus that you have Ben Ben Shapiro on this podcast but they don't they don't Focus that you have Bernie Sanders on how weird is it but they do they do Focus but what I'm saying is like people in the left will say you're a monster that you would have Ben Shapiro on and they've completely forget that you gave one of the great potential socialist presidents of our time of platform that you supported they forget that and Andrew Yang and tulsy G to me that's of my favorite that's the part that drives me nuts is it's like why do they forget that I'm a Savage that's why what do you mean I'm a Savage I'm a [\\xa0__\\xa0] cage fighting commentator I do I commentate for UFC I do stand-up comedy I do wild comedy I'm a wild person it's a different thing I understand it's just a we we have to stop trying to push people down in order to push ourselves ahead and if we just all look at it like look there's things about all sorts of aspects of society that I don't agree with that smart people disagree with right I don't know if they're right I don't know if I'm right I don't know I would like to talk forever to people that are vegans like my friend John Joseph he's the singer the the the crom mags he's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] interesting dude man you know and he he's a he's been a vegan forever and he's like a super [\\xa0__\\xa0] strong guy like mentally physically just triathlons I want people to think different than me I want them to right I want bad [\\xa0__\\xa0] to have a completely separate ideas of how the world should or shouldn't work what is wrong or isn't wrong what's right or isn't right what's privilege what's [\\xa0__\\xa0] I want everybody to come to the table clean I want everybody to come to the table warm I want everybody to hug I really do and I think we're all scared and I think it [\\xa0__\\xa0] up everybody and if everybody who wants progress doesn't want people to feel good about running into each other and talking things through we're going into this thing with the wrong energy the right energy is going into this thing going listen I didn't ask to be born you didn't either here we are 2020 trying to figure the world out but let's just admit the the idea of wrestling between gay and straight black and white male and female those are so dumb I don't want to do that I don't want to do that I want I want to be I want to talk to honest and dis honest I want to talk to secure and insecure I want to talk to loving and hateful I want to hug people that needed I want to figure out a way where we can get through this in a better State than we were five years ago 10 years ago let's get through this with food and water and realize we didn't need a [\\xa0__\\xa0] MX platinum card I don't want a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I I don't want it I don't want go go home you're going to be president no I don't want to be president no it doesn't matter I don't want any president that's what I want I want no president they're going to run this in your anti- campaign but you're going to I could see it happening man we should postpone the election try to find a better way to do this no do the [\\xa0__\\xa0] election get Biden in there get a non lunatic in there what we need is um romantic tension between a 24y old like super super liberal super attractive woman and like a 32-year-old Navy SEAL who's also married and no one cheats on anybody but they have the sexual tension and they keep it together and they work their way through veganism what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] and what are you talking about I'm trying to [\\xa0__\\xa0] fix the world Duncan I'm trying to tell you that all the things that we see pros and cons pluses and minuses is yeah man I'm just trying to figure out like we got to the election and suddenly it's this erotic romance between this 24y old that's so much better than a [\\xa0__\\xa0] guy with fake hair and some dead man weakend at Bernie with a cop shoving her hand up his ass and walking him to the aisle here's the thing that I don't understand in sports somebody in any [\\xa0__\\xa0] sport if they're not doing great that night the coach pulls them off and puts someone better in here's the thing Duncan Trussell no one wants that spot the replacement no one why who wants to be president I would love to be [Laughter] president the [\\xa0__\\xa0] the [\\xa0__\\xa0] the [\\xa0__\\xa0] look at your face oh oh my God Jamie I don't want to go through an election but like I would like that listen elections are so archaic that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] wood stoves yeah but I would love to be president being president would be so fun would it be here's the best part you could exonerate all your friends that is the the most ridiculous thing about being president you can the best you can just decide you're out I'm gonna pardon out by the way he's a bad guy but he's a good guy and here's a really important thing the Trump Administration just let out one of the great LSD chemists of our time who's that I can't remember his name it's so sad if you look it up don't say it don't say it don't say it no you should say blew up that guy spot that was throwing cigarettes on the ground in Utah no look he deserves to be his name deserves to be spoken you know who contacted me recently who do you remember the nuro soup story William Leonard peard do you remember uh I'm so drunk me too do you remember neuros soup yeah yeah she was a girl who was on YouTube and her and I I I went back with her this is an interesting thing she had a a a detailed account of how she put DMT up her [\\xa0__\\xa0] she dated William Leonard peard yeah yeah that's the guy that had the LSD lab in the middle of the bunker and the DMT accelerator pedal he contacted me okay and from prison I don't know I just got an email and um it's not my main account but I was like hm maybe that's real but that lady um she had a whole YouTube series about different ways she took drugs yeah and one of them was she took DMT up her [\\xa0__\\xa0] woo it was a bad trip she had a bad trip yeah but part of me was like that girl DMT up the ass that's a rare human that's a great night a rare human looks at that DMT nugget that little cocoa pop whatever it is Honeycomb Cheerios I want to I want that in my life I want to be around someone who's like I that's so free put it up your [\\xa0__\\xa0] would you even consider it yes really I would put DMT up my ass I've thought about it after I heard about it it's a good way to let the UN Universe no you give [Laughter] up it's the end it's a video game it's a part of the video game where you're like done dud come move to Texas please North Carolina [\\xa0__\\xa0] where the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you're moving why do we have to be localized you want to live in Tennessee I want no I look we don't have to be locked into any place bought you a house we don't have to be locked into a place Joe I appreciate you and by the way I know you I want to fix things I know that you buy houses of your friends I want to fix things so sweet you would say that but look we don't have to be spatially disconnected I think we can fix things Duncan we can all you're already look man you're already fixing things I think you can help me I would I will help you any way better with you I'm better with you than without you listen man I'm better with you than without you that's real that's real it's true you and I both talked about this not just on podcast I think but even like on just phone calls but that when we do podcast I feel like you bring me to a place that I don't really get without you yeah we're friends really I really feel like that because I've known you so long like I remember when you had this breakup and we lived together and you called me up like I don't know what to do I'm like [\\xa0__\\xa0] man come live with me yeah I was so happy I was one of the comics that you evolved and when and also like in that that moment where I was living with you it wasn't like some kind of like National Lampoon Vacation thing you were like really serious with me and you were not serious all the time we had a few like really serious talks and in those serious talks you like help me realize that like I had to stop being so flippant with my life and it was really good and you weren't [\\xa0__\\xa0] around it was cool and it was very sweet and I'll never forget it man and and uh well you know what I wanted to say to you th this is this was what when you see someone who is at a bump in the road many things can happen right yeah and for you I wanted you to know that like you can most certainly get upset along the way at different or you can be almost almost immune to all the bumps in the road it's really how you decide and if you decide you're this [\\xa0__\\xa0] Peter Pan character and just like float through this like there's ways that you're lucky in ways that other people that live in Afghanistan and the Congo will never understand never understand now man you weren't letting me do that but you and I when we were hanging out together I was like I was like I remember the moment you called me there wasn't even a half a second between you say I was like Yay Duncan's going to live with me y that's sweet man and I wanted you to get in the tank and and I got yeah oh that's great man I love it and like I I'm not trying to like your perception of it may even be different from mine but like one qu one thing that happened I have a few memories of that incredible gift that you gave me one of the memories is riding up to your house I don't even know how you got into my car that you would be in my Mini Cooper which was red at the time I remember that we're driving up to visit you we're listening to Elliot Smith I'm playing Elliot Smith yes he's talking about [\\xa0__\\xa0] morose things and you I this so I remember like and I've been listening to that nonstop so we're riding up this hell to your mansion and listening to Elliot Smith in my mini C so this is like I this is before your podcast but before you had become like what you are now just imagine folks listening riding in a Mini Cooper with Jo Joe Rogan and our cherry red byy Cooper trying to play Elliot Smith for him CU it's really been moving you I'm not playing it for you cuz like any other reason than this is what I've been tuned into for like a long time and so we're riding up this hill to your to your Manion and I remember you look at me in this way that only like real friends can do this and you look at me and you go you have to stop listening to this you are like you can't listen to this anymore like this is terrible this is like hurting you and it was it wasn't from a judgmental place or a place of musical Brilliance it was a friend being like dude you are depressed that guy gives out a vibration you know he was he was incredibly depressed and and Incredibly talented a terrible Nexus so good so good and he was a trap but like it's a trap but it is a trap it's like you can squeeze out some really super positive juice and then to the left of your body you're filled with cancer like that's that's the that's the problem with people that there's there's so many different things where people are depressed and morose and they're talking about really dark things but dude it wasn't just you like so I get to your house I'm in this Mansion all of a sudden you had a that was this when you had a [\\xa0__\\xa0] piranha tank do you remember that you had piranhas remember so all of a sudden I'm in a like Mansion where there's a piranha tank and Eddie Bravo I remember cuz I was going up like to fake to like hide smoking cuz I I was addicted at the time and so yeah and I remember like I was sneaking up to smoke and at some point Eddie Bravo I'd like gone up this hill to like like hide smoking and Ed Eddie Bravo walks up the hill to me and is like imitating smoking to me making fun of me for being addicted to cigarettes but like but like you know you know what but Joe you know what happened like if I live this is where I really go back and I think Eddie Bravo in that moment I'm like what a prick don't tell me not to [\\xa0__\\xa0] smoke cut to me sitting in front of a doctor being like well you have cancer in your balls and I and I and I remember like referring back to that moment where he was like stop smoking yeah you know what I mean which was cool it was like like there's so many like in those moments well there's a thing where you can do where you can protect people temporarily from their emotions but you won't protect them from the consequences of their actions that you see that may they don't and I think we're all responsible for our friends blind spots and when we see blind spots go hey hey hey hey hey there's only so much you can do though there's only so much you can do now Eddie Bravo could have like turned into a dragon and been like creepy right nicotine's a very addictive drug man it gets you it get get you in a weird way but he was legitimately trying yeah to get me to stop smoking Eddie Bravo is a good man that was a sweet moment like when I look back I always like when I look back precancer I always think of that moment it's like man you thought that guy was such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] like you thought he was such aun because you didn't want to quit that Hab yes if I I always like but you look back like he wanted me to do better he didn't want me to get one of my balls chop I got L I got L I got lucky because like it didn't spread through my whole body and I didn't die we have two choices right now I can pee my pants or I could run to the bathroom and we stop it and then we come back no don't stop but I've never had it where you go to the bathroom talk to Jamie we're five hours in how many hours it doesn't matter I got to be so bad be right amazing I've been Dy I've been dying for this moment Jamie just so you know like through the years of us doing Rogan I usually am the one who has to go to pee Oh my God but in this moment here I am in a with the thing happening and uh you know it does what does he do in this spot with when the guest leaves what does he does he say pull something up you're doing no he feel just talk he just yaps yeah well uh good at it subscribe to my patreon dtfh we have a Tuesday we have a meditation uh Wednesdays we're doing a doom book club it's amazing the book Doom by Frank Herbert is incredible Fridays we have a family gathering it's just us hanging out but join us there uh you know the truth is it is a simulation you know and we told you that before you linked into the thing and uh we told you we would wipe your memory and that you would feel like you were uh helpless in the sense that the thing you are right now you don't know what the power that you wield so you you chose that just you know and we said that in this moment we would do a thing where we alerted you of the fact that you had been you had intentionally decided to dive into a simulation making you limited very powerful you're Thor in the in the human world that you're in right now you're actually Thor you uh you're you're a powerful Norse god that has gotten sucked into a very temporary like magic spell isn't even that powerful compared to the powers in the world you come from but right now you have become convinced that you are a limited identity in the Mortal realm which you requested by the way you said I want to be an insurance agent real estate agent school teacher psychologist fireman cop I wanted to be an a pilot somebody was a flight attendant someone who worked in a mum teacher somebody who was a historian a failed writer a failed comedian you and and you became this temporary thing but the truth is you're a God and you're confused Joe welcome back oh my God I peed so hard it was amazing I don't want it to it I just want everyone to know if you're like if you're like no one should have this amount of uh influence no one no one should be able to say things that affect politics no social ideas you're right I don't I don't I agree with you right I didn't want to do this right this is a weird thing yeah but I'm doing my best that's stop I'm not stopping D you're going to retire because like no matter what you do it's like Jiu-Jitsu you can't go for a choke just right away you can't just dive on the choke yeah you got to slowly cook the person slowly where work through positions what's the joke here re naked real naked you get the mounts you let them Buck you off you get half guard you hold on you escape side control you try to mount again they turn over you get their back hooks in squeeze Jesus Christ takes time all things take time don't you worry though like that like what if like and again like we've been going on so many hours now so now at this point I'm just fing how much time has this podcast going on 4 minutes and 40 seconds but don't you wor 4 hours and 40 minutes Joe don't you worry that spy's first episode we're right I was right I knew it you knew it I'm like Duncan has to be number one do you know you had to be number one when you invited me on I didn't even I tried not to think about it because I was so flattered by you have to I felt Darkly flattered and then I and then I on your like subreddit I saw the don't read that the votes for who crazy people I saw the votes for who would be on the number one thing I wasn't even listed Joe those people are fools no they're not I I actually listen listen to me they're fools I know what I'm doing look at this [\\xa0__\\xa0] knife dude tuckamore custom knives shout out did but like not to like I do feel like a kind of people are fools they're wrong listen you you have helped me in many steps of the way because uh you and I as friends um you know we we we came from different backgrounds but we're both very compassionate and very interested in exploring alternative ideas both of us and we we we you and I have had so many conversations where you said something to me and I've went hm damn maybe huh and I've had to reconsider the way I was focusing in on something and because I respect you and this is something I've said of Ari as well and and Joey and even Eddie Bravo and Jamie and all the people that I'm around if if you say something to me I consider it like I'm thinking of it in a different way like if you say I don't think that's a good idea because of this I go huh okay tell me why right and I I'll let it go I I I'm I don't want to be I don't want to cling on to that early idea man and I think that's half our problem that's half our problem you know I've always felt like a weird sense of guilt about Eddie Bravo man cuz like Eddie Bravo uh want me to do that yeah yeah thanks dude I always felt like a weird is a Gil Jamie said yeah I thought he to cut his finger off last time he did I felt I felt like a weird s a gill Edie Bravo cuz like and I don't agree with all his conspiratorial ideas no I don't either but neither does he but dude this is an important thing like this is an important thing like not only did he tell me to quit smoking and then I got one of my [\\xa0__\\xa0] B and I got one of my balls chopped off well he was right about that but right but I want to tell you another thing he said don't eat [\\xa0__\\xa0] he said another cheers brother he said another thing to I do feel like it's worth mentioning I've always felt a weird sense of guilt because I I think I judged him harshly and it makes me feel like a a dumb dumb but like like cuz he's like a jiujitsu master you know so like I always he's you know he's my master yeah like if someone said who's your master I'd say first John jock Machado second Eddie Bravo one of my best friends is my master so I always felt I always had this trick at the very least a trickling sense of like man I think you're ra about your judgment there but but it's dangerous yeah it's danger can kill you yeah well that also talking that's the problem anytime I've been talking to him I'm always a little bit like nous at any moment I could die it's like a pet snake yeah like what if some at some moment you do like go insane and decide to kill me I won't I won't you know who I feel like that around who Joey Joey Diaz yes what are you you think he would kill you no no no no but he's so wild he's so crazy he like he's like a bear I want to keep feeding Joey Diaz is like you know he's the goat you know that right well I do like you know he had he he's the greatest of all time there's no one who's ever been funnier I've I've seen Joey Diaz hit like frequencies I've never seen anybody else hit yeah he was hanging out in uh Colorado with like like around Shambala which is like the place like my meditation teacher's teacher was teaching Boulder Yeah man so he encountered some like beings there that were like really Advanced and like he he he actually he like digested some of that stuff like he's wild Joey Diaz is wild remember like to me like the thing that like you know one of the aspects of this particular moment the kie Yuka that so [\\xa0__\\xa0] up this is kuga right yeah it has to be well kuga like a lot of people explain so kuga it's the age we're in right now explain the yugas so the yugas are like vast spans of time and we're considered to be in the kuga now the other this is like something that was actually actually predicted several years ago yeah well hund like thousands of years ago but in terms of like people recognizing this right now is kuga kuga there's there's AR there's like you know differences what part of the kuga we're in but there's no difference in that we're in the kuga explain the yugas I'm sorry the yugas are a period of time that um um one of the ways to like that they get represented is like uh imagine a dove flying through the sky with a silk scarf and in the beak and the tip of the scarf brushes against the peak of the halalas so the amount of time it takes for one of those Peaks to get pushed down to a valley that could be considered a Yuga it's like it's a it's a it's actually a in Hinduism it's a it's a period of time and people argue about that length of time negotiable it's negotiable but there's certain symptoms for each Yuga and so the K Yuga the uh symptoms are uh you can't remember very well your memory's all [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you're impetuous you're fat you're fast in your decisions you're easily addicted you know if you look back at the uh history of Hinduism the vadas were originally sung so they were memorized and people would sing them they would sing them and they weren't written down writing is considered a degradation yeah yeah it was written down because they heard it and then they they like it was written down later down the line the idea was you didn't need to write anything down cuz you would memorize it I I remember when I was a kid in high school my friend Brian catel going through all the numbers he' memorized and it was so many he had so many phone numbers memorized because we didn't have phones so you had to memorize numbers or write them down in a little pad so what we consider to be technology is really a crutch to make up for our idiocy in the age of the kuga which is what we're in right now and a lot of people get confused because they think Kali means kie the goddess of Destruction how many youas I'm not I think four three or for what what do you know I don't know the I don't know the answer I only know the Jamie's like this is an 8 Hour podcast even know how to look this up right now you have to give him overtime pay I've been trying to figure out too that not that I want to end this at all but this being our first Spotify podcast it kind of has to be two we have other things I don't know how they're going to deal with this file and whatnot well we we we're right now at 5 hours into the podcast right how many hours yeah 5 hours we should just make it two two and 1 half hour podcast I feel like I've been stopping it should we I don't know how to I don't want it SP Spotify I know what I'm doing this is why I brought Ducky on I'm GNA miss you man that's the main thing You're Not Gon to miss me I'm GNA be around you come on dude you want to live in South Dakota I'm sorry I forgot I didn't want to South Dakota my sweet home I [\\xa0__\\xa0] Arizona sorry I'm going to South Dakota and I can't wait but dude it's rough to come in here see people pack cuz look man here's the main thing it's like we're not packing Stone yeah dude but it's not we're not packing ourselves up because of some like like like tones Thompson thing we're packing ourselves up because the country we were born into has fallen into the throws of a really dark period induced by a once in a hundred-year pandemic that's what I'm saying but why do you want to live in a place where none of us are living why not think about this I I know why I don't want to live in Austin I know that why well cuz I'll tell you why Joe if you really want another real dark reason cuz you announced it you know what I mean had you not announced it it might be a different story but you and Elon Musk was G to get out anyway yeah but elon's coming to Austin you're coming to Austin talking about it I know so welcome like Austin that's Silicon Valley so no yeah yeah dude yeah I'm sorry but that is what you have created by your I do you know uh Matthew has a great idea what he wants to make a primer for people moving to Austin where you say hey don't turn what you escaped from into the place you're going to oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's brilliant yeah don't turn the place you're escaping to exactly like where you fled yeah man yeah I get it brilliant and that's he's right Austin this what we we were talking about earlier we're we were talking about defunding the police and defunding ice and Def like all this nonsense that people are like let's just like figure out a way to be nice to each other yeah man I agree and I don't think that's based on any locality now the Austin thing I like offline I'll tell you my decision cuz I did offline I didn't think about it Joe I thought about it what turned you off to it well you know my my feeling is it's it's I'm stammering cuz it's like telling you why I would reveal where I'm headed and I don't mean to be like like all magical about that but the main thing listen let me say where you are headed is a great choice thank you brother I've been and you fit in there like a pee in the Pod I might wind up being there you might I'm ready to keep moving listen this is the thing I think about the Spotify deal and and and just the idea of what a is moving forward I want you to be involved it's why I wanted you to be number one and like legitimately you and I have some of my favorite conversations brother I love you man I love you too we've been friends for a long [\\xa0__\\xa0] time yeah man I'll be involved with anything you're involved then let's do it and I I meant that and by the way not not not to go back to Eddie Bravo apologetics but I didn't finish my point back then and I think it's an important point to make he said to me something that was so [\\xa0__\\xa0] weird when he said and this was on top of him taking on a missionary stance with my inhalation of tobacco smoke so by then I was already like over little defensive I was defensive and I I didn't I I was like I was too dumb at that time to like recognize like [\\xa0__\\xa0] man this guy's got a [\\xa0__\\xa0] like he's a jiujitsu master so what he's saying is not coming from like a place of someone who like hasn't like worked really hard at a particular he's saying just don't kill your body yeah but one thing he's said to me which is I always think back to it cuz I really remember when he said I was like you sick of Fant and what he said to me was exactly what's happening to you right now what did he say he said you have no idea what's going to happen to him he's going to be like like he's going to be so huge and I remember him saying it this was this was Fear Factor it was not like a safe assessment man it was like when he said it to me it felt culty it felt [\\xa0__\\xa0] up it felt like it felt crazy right and it was I I remember him saying it to me and like being like man you're I didn't say it cuz I was afraid of him we I'm thinking like you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] crazy that you would think that but he you know it's weird that he's right you know that's what's weird about it it's like this is is your first episode on Spotify and it's crazy man because like I get and I'm honored deeply honored that you invited me out well there was no second choice do you know that thank you brother you were First Choice 100% across the board when they said who do you want to have first on Spotify before they said Spotify is a dunan trussle that's so cool Joe I appreciate so cool and I I really believe that what what I said that I think you and I have different shows there's something about you and I together that is different than just me by myself man we friends we we're not just friends man like we've known each other for so long and there's no doubt we've tested each other back and forth up and down and left and right we know we love each other like you know if if you call me up at 3: in the morning Joe I need your help like I am [\\xa0__\\xa0] there dude I'm a Commando I'm ready to drop in from a helicopter I'm going to save you yeah and because of that like because of our long relationship we've been we've been friends for so long dude I mean how long when do we like '90s when did you start working with the story '90s dude we've been friends since the '90s the '90s so more than 20 years yeah we we've gone you have seen me go from being the town court of The Comedy Store to being someone supporting themselves off of their comedy man like you you've seen me go from like you you were friends with me when I was like uh when I was when I was like no no one would have like ever gambled on anything happening with me other than no not no one just no one's stupid I saw it right away when the moment I first saw you do little hobo yeah dude I saw you do little hobo in the O and I'm like oh my God yeah man but you keep doing that that to me like that's the thing is like you keep doing that like that's the reason that you uh you deserve what you have you really do like all the haters all the people who are like I get the haters it's like it doesn't work the the the trick is it's like I get it if you're not a like someone explained it to me that like when you look at people that doing really well especially if they all socialize with each other it becomes like a Walled Garden and it feels like it's alienated it feels like you're you're isolated you're locked out and it makes you feel bad it makes you feel shitty yeah and that's the problem that's the problem dude you hated me you just so you know like when we first met no you didn't hate me but you were irritated by me cuz like you don't remember when you first met was in the belly room I was with Princess Corey Cory Como and like uh I was trying to at the time I was really into like it wasn't even called trolling them but it was like saying a thing opposite to what you should say and I remember like something you were a contrarian I was being a contrarian and something came up about marijuana you mentioned marijuana I'm sitting with Cory com I'm always I was already nervous around you cuz at the time you were like you know you were you were still like at that time you were still like in this incredible trajectory and like I made a stupid joke about how weed was like bad you know I'd come from like I was like you know there's never been a time that I haven't been high for years and you know what I mean especially then but I made this dumb joke about how weed was and I remember you looked at me with such such like a scaving look of like cuz you had just started like understanding how wonderful marijuana was and you really thought I meant we was bad and I remember Corey gave me this look of like no Duncan no don't don't do the joke it was a terrible moment because you weren't you weren't in a place where you could even like you weren't tolerating that because you were were getting high and starting to realize that it wasn't probably what well I think when I first started smoking pot I became a zealot like real quick because I realized i' had been lied to that's it and I had misunderstood the the the idea of what marijuana was I I became a zealot that's what it was you were a zealot in the look you gave me I remember the way you looked at me I realized like God damn he I bet he hates me forever never but today in the same situation I'd be like yeah right I funny you were defensive yeah yeah I was a zealot I was certainly a zealot once I first experienced marijuana I I became a zealot but you and I had such awesome conversations we had most of our conversations when we first became friends on the phone I would call you up I go yo dude I'm here uh Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday what's up what are you doing man like dude I read this Alice Huxley book and you start telling me about some crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] and you and I would just go I mean it would be like a a significant chunk of my day on like Monday when I would call in is that you and I would have these cool conversations so you take me on the road with you we go to the Irvine Improv we're driving back from the Irvine Improv in your car I'm so stoned you're playing Terrence McKenna Terrence McKenna is talking about the singularity and he's talking about like uh this idea that we're accelerating towards this point in the future novelty yeah and I I'll never forget that ride back from the Irvine impr I'll never forget it because like I'd never heard that Terence McKinna speech I knew about Terence McKinna roughly from like you know I I had encountered him in my earlier years as a psychona but like something about that particular lecture that you're playing something about leaving something as weird as a comedy show and this idea that he was saying and this is the part that still sticks with me to this day which is you know look we are heading towards a point of concurr currence of events that is known as a singularity and that the closer we get to it the more we're going to experience these think tachon particles being blown backwards through time that will produce these events in history that we call novelty and something about that ride back and just that moment me listening to it I started think I it wasn't like I even thought this isn't real I thought that is real and so here we are now 2020 in the middle of a pandemic you've become what has been described as the Oprah for men broa broa and you are like you are someone who like great leaders and principalities are trying to get into this podcast do you remember when you live with me and I started buying Buddha [\\xa0__\\xa0] started buying like you already had the Buddha [\\xa0__\\xa0] but I started buying all the I like bought a Shiva I bought this giant bronze Shiva I brought they're like and you go hey you know why you're attracted to this right yeah well that's what that's the thing that weirds me out about you man that's the part that where I'm like oh I get it it's like well there was some realization that happened and you're picking up on that and so because you're picking up on that you have ganes out here and you have all these like Eastern symbols but I just think they look cool no no I don't that's what I think well yeah you think you think they look cool but also you happen to have this massive audience uh regardless of whatever that is I just remember that uh that r i remember that ride back and I remember like I remember like thinking like you know I think there's something real in here like I think what McKenna is saying is probably true you know I think this uh pandemic I think this pandemic represents something he predicted which is we're in a novel wave right now this is It's been it's been a century since the last pandemic no no one here knows how to deal with this and now we're in a novelty wave and maybe well we got lazy we we didn't take into account all of the possible variables and a big one with this Administration was uh pandemics yeah man but not just that it's like the problem is like where you're kind of in a bit of a bind is that all this human attention has been placed upon you and you have to wrestle with your identity because that's why I need you to move to Austin you don't need me an Austin my friend come help me come on I can't do this to I'll help you I'll be I'm always there for you man but the problem is is like you have this burden of attention and it's like it's a it's a real like for whatever reason like some like you've people have decided you're you're one of the magnifying glasses focusing this beam of attention into the world and So within that is all this room for disaster it's like you know what I mean like room for disaster is the perfect way to put it yeah oh my God yeah someone pays attention to every aspect of your life there's so much room for disaster yeah man but I think at a certain point in time it's like there's a sacrificial lamb a person who lays himself down on the cross is that you no all of us it's all of us but you know it's a it's a really you are in a bit of a bind because the pro it's like look man here's what I love about not being George Washington I didn't have to make the decisions he made there I'm reading this book Dune it's so beautiful like if someone says Duncan I know you only have 14 teeth I don't have to make the decision but I can sell you all the rest of them for I don't have to I don't be Shillings I don't to be Jesus I don't two P I don't have to be church I don't have to be any of these people man I don't want to be them I would not assign myself to that Incarnation but like in Dune I'm reading this great book Dune by Frank Herbert it's so good and in in this desert world there's these beings called The Fan they're like they they they like have become they represent complet complete Attunement with nature and so at at this wonderful point in the book this Imperial like Galactic representative of this imperialism is like sitting in a like Canyon with all his wounded men they're almost done and the fman one of these tribal beings is saying to them you have to make a water decision and what they mean by that is your wounded men you have to pick one of them to die and we render their body into water because in this world there's no water so you have to make a water decision and the the fan is interacting with the being in this pure way which is the only only way you can act if you're truly in two of nature you're innocent and and it isn't like dark or anything he's like you have to make a water decision right and the being is saying to him like hesitating and the fan is saying to him do you want me to make the water decision for you and they don't mean it in an aggressive way they mean like would you you love these people would you give up the decision to us wouldn't you be enough to make the decision yourself fortunately in the book one of them dies and they they're able to like Ren their body into water but what I'm saying is like these being the position of power and all the whole series of Dune is based on this problem which is like if you get saddled with any kind of power even if it's a even if you want to pretend it's a kind of clownish power you are still in a very difficult situation because you have to make a water decision like you will have to like if you're Trump and you're a clown president or if you're Obama you're some Advanced president orone lost and there's only 20 of you yeah man someone's got to become water you have to make a water decision if you're if you're the president there 335 million people everything you decide is a water decision that's a little easier but if you're on Lost yeah there's 13 people left yeah man it's brutal it's brutal and like no matter what trick you try to use to deal with it no matter what trick you Ed you're still forced into this terrible it's a predicament man it's a Chinese handcuff situation it's like Chinese handcuffs are [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's not a Chinese handcuff that's ever been invented it's going to hold me down it's a creepy Place Chinese handcuffs are like this yeah well yeah I know I know man but it's ultimately it's like damn I always feel bad it's like I never want you to trend on Twitter whenever I see you trending on Twitter it really sucks for me cuz I'm like [\\xa0__\\xa0] is he okay that's what I hate about Twitter is like people will trend on Twitter you know what I'm saying and it's like I do I get it I hate it cuz I'm like [\\xa0__\\xa0] was it in a car accident I think just stay off Twitter yeah you're right I got to say on Twitter I just don't think it's good for you the problem is you're you're interacting with people that don't they're not communicating first of all and foremost maybe they're they're not communicating with people that are right in front of them so they don't feel social cues they don't feel empathy they don't feel so they're they're talking in this weird way that's only existed for like [\\xa0__\\xa0] 10 years it's at dunan TR on Twitter follow me Duncan trussle on Twitter no you're right IE you two L's two s's two L's no jiren laner you know like the idea is like get the [\\xa0__\\xa0] off social media I agree I don't think that's right either is it weird for this I think I think I think it's inevitable I think it's too big too much of a part of everything I think there's no I don't think there's a future in telling people to stay off it I think there's more of a future of telling people to understand what it is and manage it to look at social media to look at Twitter and and Instagram and all those things and understand what they are I don't think you have to get off but you should you should spend a lot of time outside of that I got to get off there man it's not good to read comments it's not good to um Google your name I don't think that's good and that's how when you see me and you see I'm okay that's why cuz I don't do that those things you get crazy should we cut ourselves for Spotify should we like do like a little Blood Brother ritual where we cut our fingers and like mix our blood that's how you get your [\\xa0__\\xa0] covid test earlier let's do it we're like Co we don't have we don't have Co anymore should we like do a slice no come on it's good Jesus why not Duncan got all great all great rich rituals are based in like some kind of blood Bond do you think there's this honestly if you didn't know me if I wasn't your friend would you think there's a responsibility that I have that I'm not meeting no I think you're meeting it I think the problem is like no matter how like it's like the it's hilarious and in the in in Star Trek you know Captain Kirk they if you're going to be like someone who like gets to be a commander of a Starship you're given a problem that is unsolvable so no matter what you do it's you can't win no matter what like when you get to a certain level of power any decision you make on some level is wrong and right simultaneously this is quantum Computing my friend so I do not you know in my analysis of your podcast and all my deep judgmental qualities I do not see what you're doing as being wrong at all I see sometimes you make naive decisions that I would make too what would you say I think sometimes you have people on who later found out to be like at least in the moment they were on the show a little like [\\xa0__\\xa0] up like for sure in the early days I I had an issue in the early days where I didn't want to admit that I was getting as many views as there was and uh I would do a show and I'm just like no one's watching this and I would have some crazy person on and maybe uh there there was a few that was like I shouldn't have talked to that dude that dude was [\\xa0__\\xa0] up yeah but that was uh learning process you know that was there's there's a thing about doing a podcast where there's no school for it right there's no way to figure out how to do it perfectly it's not like learning how to play piano it's real linear there's all these weird ways to do it and no one knows so unfortunately I was like I guess like second generation first generation is for sure Adam Curry he's the poda and then there's like uh Adam Corola there's a few other people but I I came right after that yeah 2009 so no one knew what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] we were doing and I think there was a there's certainly been some times where I didn't want to admit that it was reaching as many people as it was yeah you can't think about that cuz it makes you feel crazy well that's why I want to have you on cuz I knew we were going to get drunk and get high and the first episode would be as Preposterous as an episode can be yeah and then from this you can like have people on who are like real or whatever I mean look man anyone ever I've ever talked to anytime I've ever been in a situation where people are talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] about you or or like questioning my friendship with you because I think because I'm because you had this person or that person on if I'm friends with you something's weird with you or me or whatever I all I always and will forever stand up for you man because I know you and I and I and and to me it's like look what like you got into this ridiculous predicament like you're in a you're in a bind man you are you are in a bind and it's a beautiful it's a beautiful bind but it's a real it's a real problem and but like because of your heart which is very open and very sweet you allow this like you allow everyone to have you allow a lot of people on your podcast that don't make sense according to the zis and so people get mad at you and they pound and and I I always feel so rotten about that because it's like man you don't understand this is a real Progressive like you're looking at someone who is exactly the being that you would hope would be the like result of like great government and great education and you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] attacking an ally that's the part that gets me up that's where I get really bummed is it's like man you have to understand that person look you should if you ask me I feel like Duncan should I have Ben Shapiro on I feel like no jo no there's so many better people to have on in that guy but that doesn't mean you can't have those other people on too well if you listen to me but I would say to you I go listen man I know what you're saying but if I just took you to dinner you me and Ben chapiro went to some [\\xa0__\\xa0] kosher joint i' love i' love hang out with him we I I guarantee you you'd like him no I know that he's a good guy the problem is not him the problem is all the people's reactions to him and him right those there two things going on two things the things that he said and the reactions and the fact that he's kind of weaponized their reactions yeah look he's a good guy look I don't I to me it's like I I would I would be so bored if you only have people on the show that I agreed with it would be such a shitty show but I I do have a a rule where I I won't have anybody on anymore unless I feel that they enter into those arguments with good faith yeah man I know that and I feel like Ben Shapiro he enters into all discussions with good faith he's not an insulting guy he he and I have had interesting conversations about gay marriage interesting conversations about um uh all sorts of uh aspects of society racial relations black lives matters and and and and he and I talked about it in a very respectful way even though we disagree there's been no there's been no insults there's been no shittiness and I think that's the problem with putting a guy like that on some sort of a standard traditional talk show you have him on and some social justice Warrior and they argue with each other and you got a host and you break every seven minutes to go to commercial you don't find out what he's about he's not a bad guy man and he gets shaped as much by those seven minute segments where you're battling it out to get soundes as you and I do byin spots at The Comedy Store trying to pass open mic night based on this podcast you would imagine that I have a chip on my shoulder about Ben Shapiro which I really don't I don't think you do I don't think you the reason I brought up Eddie Bravo is only because like uh I think like what you're doing is really sweet and good and I think your heart is in the same place it was and I met you a while ago which is pretty bizarre like they would somehow maintain a a thing that's integral you know I've met you know you meet people out here who go through rough patches and they're not who they portray themselves as initially they're actually like con artists or fuckups or like bad temporarily I think people get better but sometimes they're bad temporarily but you you really like have like maintained this I think a really beautiful kind of uh North Star regarding your ethics and your consideration and things so yeah man I I'm like I'll do anything for you really I'm one of your great devotees I'll kill for you Joe I'm one of your great devotees I I I really am too man I I feel like like legitimately honestly I I I I feel like I've been tested where I've been given an opportunity to help other people and uh I feel like it's uh there's no controversy in my mind my mind knows the right choice yeah man and so I've always tried to promote all these different comics and I think that that's what we should all do with each other I think I don't think we need to make all the money I think you need to make some money I need to make some money what do we need man we need barbecues and [\\xa0__\\xa0] Margaritas I've hugs I'm not a selfish person I've seen a lot of people be selfish I've never seen you be like this is the thing I don't care but here's how I'm selfish I'm selfish and that I'm not selfish cuz I know that being selfish is negative to you it's bad for you it's dangerous it's sloppy it's weak it's some [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] so I never I'm never selfish because I'm selfish because I don't want myself to be a [\\xa0__\\xa0] you discovered a like thing I figured it out when I was uh jealous I figured it out when I was younger I remember watching Comics who were better than me when I was like 21 and I was thinking like God [\\xa0__\\xa0] these guys how did he come up with that joke and then I and I I I don't remember when it happened but it was early like 21 22 I remember catching it and going oh I caught a bad pattern like I got this pattern where I'm jealous instead of like or I could be the way I was before I ever got into comedy which is inspired instead I was jealous and so it it made me realize like oh I've got a bad pattern that I'm I'm chasing this bad pattern do you remember that time Joe that we drank a bowl of blood in front of that m statue it was chicken blood we were dying anyway whatever look I feel like it's like I'm I I do is this the longest podcast ever look it doesn't matter where we we're done I got to pee again let's wrap it up wrap it up but what are we at and hours 5 and a half hours it's over we did it Kevin Smith was 5 hours we won Joe thank God you think you should do this in two podcast I think we should whatever you want to do care right listen Spotify don't get greedy we give you a 6- hour opening podcast 5 and half hour thanks my friends it gets better there's going to be actual scientists on this show if you keep listening uh I will talk Duncan Trussell into doing regular podcast either through Zoom Skype I have I I have thoughts I have ideas I want to help I would have this conversation if we were recording that's the funny thing I've I've only been I I feel like I've been extending it yeah just cuz I want to keep talking I know me too man we're going to help all right how they Kush that Jamie I'm sorry catch big kiss we should have done the blood ritual I would have cut myself we [\\xa0__\\xa0] up\""
