       "[Document(page_content=\"here we go in five four three two one yes and all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] people that make me feel lazy in this world is - okay make me feel you in the rock you [\\xa0__\\xa0] don't look like you ever sleep and I don't know no days off that's why I love is unattractive ass he's a he's a person that that motivates me inspires me in effect that we're we're coworkers were friends I think is I think it's like it's a blessing it's a blessing to be around that yeah because it truly it's it's uplifting you know it makes you it just makes you weed out the circle when you're around people that truly give you like give you some good serve a good value to you and your life you then look at those that don't and you can you can then push away so I'm big on I'm big on personality I'm big on energy I'm big on will and once I believe that is contagious so if you have a bunch of laziness and a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] around you naturally it's gonna feed off you're gonna find yourself becoming what's in your environment so I feel the exact same way and when I see I see that in you I see that in you I've seen avatar I see you I see you yeah but a guy like that like I always wonder like how much of that is look I've had sleep experts on the podcast to tell you like like there's real problems if you don't get enough sleep like you could you have a much higher risk of Alzheimer's well there's other serious issues but I see a guy like the rock I'm like how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] does he sleep what where's the room to for sleep you know that that's true I can't say that I'm that I've witnessed the sleep patterns but he's a he's a late ass so he does I know he's sleeping to some rest which is well-deserved but you know when you when you say you had these sleep experts and stuff on it's always a thing that I go back and forth about because what is enough sleep like I'm a person I function high off of six to seven hours yeah six seven hours I'm I'm functioning yeah five hours I'm great do I do the five hour thing all the time no but if I have to I'm fine I don't need the eight and the nine like that's too much for me like I'm I'm an early riser and now I'm getting older you know if I can get in that bed by 9:30 or 10:00 on an off workday I'm very happy with that but then I'm up at 5:30 I'm up at 5:00 so what is it enough sleep what do they tell you this really depends on the person there are people that have a gene where they can just sleep for hours at night I got gone oh my god I got that what is that gold what is that what does this means you got special gene goddamn right Amalia yeah that's um [\\xa0__\\xa0] there are there are people that just don't need as much they can they can go a long time without sleep diagnosed me I'm one of those people you thought you might be I bet a lot of high functioning people are cuz your body tends to you get more efficient you know like you you're always going you're burning hard so your body's like when it's time to shut down it's like shut down get that five six hours in alright do you do well I will confess this I am an amazing cat Napper yeah I'm one of those guys if you stop talking to me long enough i'ma fall asleep right here it's something about silence real and just not doing anything and I just well it's probably probably going on momentum all the time you probably you're probably going on motivation and momentum okay then when your body has this break you've already here's a little sleeper that's just right I'm dead serious that's I know for sure that that's accurate cuz I'm how catnapping heartbeat do you feel like you've hit a good balance so this is what I was wonder about guys like you or guys like the rock when I look at your Instagram your social media and you're just constantly going like god damn do you ever feel like you do too much like maybe I just need to take a little break here do you ever feel like that I think perception definitely perceives reality you know what looks like so much isn't always so much because you have a schedule and you know within that schedule there's the things that mean the most that come in act is downtime you know me in my house is downtime even though it's still active and I gotta be dead and I'm with the kids and a wife in this conversation and I'm running around and I'm back for that still exes downtime for me like I'm shutting a work off so the phone is any office I'm not going back to get it until the morning and it's all conversation it's all TV it's all Taco Tuesdays it's couch and cuddling you know baby time whatever that's my downtime because I'm taking a step outside of the other [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's wise that's that's what I think I do very well I can step outside the other [\\xa0__\\xa0] I can separate it so I think when you're able to do that then you're you're managing your mental you don't mean like if it's if it's always one thing all the time that's how you [\\xa0__\\xa0] drive yourself crazy cuz you never you're never shutting it off yeah and I think I do a good job of shutting shutting this off and focusing on this like when I want my family I'm with my family nothing is nothing interjects or comes in between that's fantastic that's so important it's understand that's beautiful I doubt that's gigantic I think I figured it out that's it you mean you've got so much success it's all you have to be with that [\\xa0__\\xa0] phone all the time that's that that's the phone is the big one right well phone the phone is is the gift and the curse mm-hmm you know I think that we we shout out the gate and saw the gift oh my god it's it's it's community is connecting us we're able to share we're able to meet new people we're able to stay in communication with with all people find new people as entertainer I can engage with my fans and this is so dope and then after that you get hit with the the curse and the curses there's a there's a high level of negativity that's out there that's on that [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know there's there's a lot of people that are you know not happy or going through things and they interject a certain amount of negativity and hatred through these devices these devices are the easiest way to touch everybody so when you're just consumed on that [\\xa0__\\xa0] all day you start to see yourself being a part of the negative [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah so what I've learned to do is go I don't I don't need to see that I don't need to see that [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't I don't pay that any mind I don't read that [\\xa0__\\xa0] for what it's not it's not helping me it's not making me better it's not it's not pushing me to new limits if anything is taken up just creative space by me literally spending time going and navigating through what I think is is a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know so I don't let the device beat me and at one point I definitely did at one point it was everything there was everything you know now I separate it I'm not embrace clear of it what when you realize what it is when you see when you see the bad you know when you see the bad side of it I thought the other day this is some real [\\xa0__\\xa0] and it really made me think my phone died my phone died and I'm driving and I was using the [\\xa0__\\xa0] maps and I said [\\xa0__\\xa0] what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] am I get to with I don't know where I'm going I said I was like you know how did we how did we get from point A to point B before the map [\\xa0__\\xa0] what were we doing that I used to print out directions from Google Maps I remember that but then before that how did you get to the places where you were going that you didn't know how to get to I don't even remember remember Thomas guys do you remember Thomas Scott I did have a Thomas guy when I first moved to LA I did have a Thomas guy and I know look a hundred percent bill burr had one two a three years ago but it really [\\xa0__\\xa0] me up because I was like how do we don't even know how how to do the common yeah the the the norm anymore because the device has made everything available and I literally had to to drive to store rocket buy a charger charge up my phone to get back and use the map to get to where the [\\xa0__\\xa0] I was going I had no idea how to get there I had no I didn't know no numbers by heart I didn't know who I was gonna call oh my god this is the moment where I was like what level of success have I reach I just pulled over and I said here and I was like how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] am I gonna get the widow's bear phone man I don't know what it were a backup phone it felt like the end of the world if it felt like it was over house like [\\xa0__\\xa0] and that crazy I dependent you are but that's when the light bulb started to click yeah it started to click like how how do we function without I want to go backwards a little bit yeah it's still there I still need it I still think it's dope with all of the things that we can do want it but I still want to be able to put it down and step away from it my kids to be able to step away from it that's why when I come in the house my phone is up cuz I can't I can't [\\xa0__\\xa0] and get playing it's all about being on your phone if you see me doing the same thing right right so that time those conversations me wanting to know about your day you talking to me about your day your friends who you like who don't you like my daughter you what boy who what no ok my son yeah I like somebody who oh jesus here it comes it's a great thing and I want to be able to have those moments and you know I think it's it's it's big to make sure that you prioritize that are you worried about what comes next hundred percent I'm worried that something's gonna be way more intrusive than that it'sit's what do you mean it's already happening yeah the biggest scare happened already with the the the FaceTime [\\xa0__\\xa0] that happened where whatever whoa Apple on the iPhones it was like people could listen in to your oh yeah if you didn't need to pick up the FaceTime you could just yeah and you know that was the scariest [\\xa0__\\xa0] ever because it's if it's that easy to have a bug like that what's the thing that's not a bug that's there that you just don't know about oh there's definitely government listen to us well hunter is it yeah 100 everything everybody says and then in case one day you do something wrong they go by your side mr. Hart we'd like you to sit down from NYU something hundred percent yeah so the fear is the next level of them are intrusive you know I think everything has become intrusive now like the toughest thing for me is that there is no there is no privacy outside my home right you know the the amount of money that you have to now spend just on security on you know people to to be with me security to be on my home you know it's like they're there literally is no privacy and it's not a bit you complain about it because without the fans without the people that support me I wouldn't be where I am but there's no middle ground right you know there is no handshakes anymore it's it's how you doing right right right yeah a handshake is so much better right I get a moment like I'm we can talk if that's what you no no yo say it now weird cuz you you're doing this to me it's kind of weird to have a conversation so you're just starting to see yourself become a little older and wiser and uh just really see the times for what they are and see the direction that we're going in this people and just hope and pray that we find a middle ground because I think right now that is it one yeah that's what I'm feeling now no I feel it too and I especially I mean what you're talking about is you being super famous and losing all your privacy but everyone's losing their privacy yes slowly but surely it's it's happening to you because you're very famous and because you do something that's in the public eye and people want to see you and they want to stick that camera in front of you but there's gonna come a point in time where what we're dealing with now which is like you have to turn your phone on you have to you know you have to reach out to somebody you have to put something up that's that steps gonna be out of the way who's gonna be people being able to act that's your life yeah pretty you know you know the bad here's what I said it's bad that really [\\xa0__\\xa0] with me I don't like that negativity is the the want you know like like the the thing that's popular is the failure the the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you know the the fight that I can catch you know the hateful moment that I can catch and post like the bad is being highlighted and celebrated that's what [\\xa0__\\xa0] with me what the social media [\\xa0__\\xa0] now what really bothers me is you know when you see these things online like you know a fight and there's a man hitting a woman and it's captured right that's bad the bad thing is that you watched that the the video was more important than the actual help right or the moment to step in and you know when you see these things where you're catching people do these things to kids and it's caught the moment of what you got and what you want to post and get likes or whatever on is the focus instead of the help yeah and that's that's the part that is just I just have a hard time processing I have a hard time processing what the likes mean to certain people well you get an extraordinary amount of attention so it doesn't mean anything to you anyway it means something to a regular person but you a regular person if they can catch some worldstar video and put it up they're like dude that's my video that's my video look my video got 5 million hits yeah my video has gone viral my videos everywhere for them it's like it's a point of excitement that's why when they see you look oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] how often are they gonna run into Kevin Hart at you know Costco or wherever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you were definitely running right it to me on uh you know I'm in a I'm in a bathroom restaurant and I go to the bathroom you know by the way that I went to the bathroom you could definitely tell I had to [\\xa0__\\xa0] I was I was moving fast I was he knows one of those abrupt you know why you eatin yeah I'm eating bad so I didn't eat bad in a while my stomach immediately said that's not gonna happen today I get up and I go and literally like like three seconds I hear it as I'm walking or they go keV hard and as I'm walking by a guy gets up follows me in the bathroom he's like yo I gotta get a picture man and I said let me let me go to the bathroom when I'm done I'll take a picture with you I go to the bathroom this is a true story hannah bible hand on the Bible I assume the guys outside the bathroom cuz I as I'm going I see him and I say what I say I get done I go to the snake wash my hand he was just sitting behind a wall and he's like got his phone out I'm like he probably did he just take me while I was [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude put the phone over the thing like I'm about to be on oh my god it's over this is it this is my nightmare here we go they're about to put something up of me shittin is the bottom of my feet it's whatever yeah but he just waited and in that moment was so it was so important that he was in the bathroom and soon as I got a call on the second I said let's go outside the bathroom yeah let's take a picture it's a bathroom I said might am I going to I'm a nice guy man I'm gonna take the picture cuz I just don't want to lose you and I'm like there's not even a thought it's not even a thought about it's a bad price how weird is that Sebastin minutes this is a this is a pretty [\\xa0__\\xa0] weird moment man this is weird Halloween you will be the finish [\\xa0__\\xa0] no no what you got on your phone right you're too big for me to ask to go through your phone or whatever you got you got but I had to go out and take the picture and I remember going back to the table just like what's happening that's not strange at this point what is happening yeah that didn't exist before I think if you were famous before people just wanted to get an autograph or shake your hand what Pat what passed an autograph stage was last time you get an autograph it's been a while I don't write it I was I think I would know what to put that it's been a minute man yeah and I don't want to make this very clear you know it's not I don't I don't know you know I understand like once again I want people to more importantly understand the fact that I welcome it yeah I welcome the moment that I can talk in and converse with the fame but it should be that like it's normal people the moments are better when they're real you know and after a real moment you you get a picture because you're like yo he was actually a nice guy or I know I did it that you would be this calm and cool you don't even get to see how genuine of a person I am because the first thing you do you you you stick the camera in the face you and that's when people think that you're an [\\xa0__\\xa0] because they they they they have the intrusive moment that then gets met with the can you keep please I'm sorry you're not the you look at my face you're gonna be like that they look for that now you get your moment yeah you you look for the negative moment when does it start getting weird for you but how many years in um I know it's been it's been pretty crazy I've been pretty crazy for like the last four to five the last four to five years and the last three you know if it's gotten insane because now you know you're you're on an international level its global and the following is is bigger and it's all ages which is which is really really good but I think you know for comedians it's a different thing because you feel like you know comedians you know you're laughing we're in your homes everything is met with warmth so when you see a comedian especially if you're a fan of a comedian you're associating everything with funny and you're just looking for the funny moment right you're you're looking past a normal moment you know it's like you you almost are frowned upon if you're normal if you just chill right right right because everybody wants the funny moment right they thought you were gonna be funny like I'm supposed to I suppose a pop lock right on the site you know yeah if it's 2:00 in the morning and you run into me and I say hey how you doing man that's not enough when work out your [\\xa0__\\xa0] now mm-hmm I've seen you at the Comedy Store but only once where do you work out your [\\xa0__\\xa0] I like to go to random comedy clubs you know I think I'll go to New York first New York has always been a home when it comes to building putting some structure within a set that you trying to figure out once I got a skeleton of what I want to do I'll just go to West Palm I love that comedy club The Improv down there and all the place is great I'll stay for two weeks Oh real and just go and run through some jokes I'll go to Utah I'll go to Denver who do two wise guys yeah yeah yeah I'll go to comedy clubs just random comedy clubs that you wouldn't expect to see me at but I'll do a hell of a run and the goal is to get out of there with just a foundation not to have a complete set I just want to get a foundation so when I'm done getting the foundation then I'll do a little comedy club run I'll do a full comedy club run where I'll just put two or three months in and it's comedy club comedy club comedy club and I'm doing seven shows a weekend and people are shocked that I'm there and then I'm doing it but you know that's my that's my gym that's how I work and I end up leaving that period of time with a complete set after the first three or four months that I spent now after that comedy club three or four months on that run then I take it to like a small theater I see what my laughter feels like in a small theater and I do a little run in small theaters and then when I finally feel like it's at a point where I'm getting the the laughs consistently and the punchlines are working and I flipped it back frontwards forward every direction and my story is a real roller coaster and it has an ending where I feel like we get off the roller coaster and we're happy and you don't feel like you were there for an hour mmm is then when I go test it out in every nough and if the arena if the last er sounds the way it's supposed to then I say okay I'm ready if it doesn't then I'll go back to small theaters and then I'll go to an arena again so not to that arena sounds the way it's supposed to do I say I'm going on tour so sometimes it takes me about a year a year and three months here in four months you know people don't say how hard it is to develop our of stand-up material people act like you just turn on a new hour it's it's an hour to get to an hour you're going through four to five hours of [\\xa0__\\xa0] that you thought was funny yeah to come up to that hour that you finally say this is gonna be the representation of me this year yeah it's a lot for me to do that especially at this level you know well especially while you're always doing movies and you're always busy with a bunch of other stuff to stuff yourself yeah you don't take any breaks white or I actually you know when I'm touring if there's a movie I make the movie schedule around the torso my shooting days will go Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday rap Thursday maybe ever show Thursday night and then I'm going Thursday Friday Saturday sometimes no show Sunday sometimes show Sunday depending on what the work schedule and the workload for the following week would look like so I'm implementing that in so when I say I'm out I'm out I'm gone yeah so I've knocked that movie out in two months and then when I'm not that tour schedule shifts so the Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday dedicated the family dedicated to an office everything then those weekends are torn but that's all last for a year and a half I mean this year we did 157 shows on my irresponsible tour Wow 157 show before you decided to put it on the Netflix special yeah we did the Netflix the taping I think I did it three weeks before we were done so we probably had 143 shows oh wow then I taped it and finish the tour did you always have this kind of structure like when did you how did you design this thought-out individual yeah I mean thought-out individual it's not random no everything is planned if you look at all my stand-up specials there's a two-year gap in between them so the two-year gap is because at the end of that second year my new special should be coming out when a new special should be coming out I'm now focusing on what the next special is going to be so that first year is all development like right now I'm off I'm not touring but now I'm mentally in the gym and throwing all the old stuff that I talked about a way that's now thrown out can't repeat it can't say it now it's talking about what the new version of myself is going to be what do I want the conversation to be and what's my thinking and just taking notes so eventually now I'm gonna start just popping up a random comedy clubs and trying to figure out what the next thing is so by mid mid 20 I'm probably doing comedy clubs by the end of 20 I have a full fledge concept of that new hour and by the beginning of 21 I should be ready to go out with my new hour hmm end of 21 film my new our mid 22 that hour will come out that seems like a schedule a lot of people are doing now the 2-year schedule it's a perfect get yeah that's hard dude I know louis c.k did a year every year and George Carlin did every year but I think even he said really wasn't the right way that's tough a year stuff yeah I mean that's a that's a shout-out to those that can't do it I think that's amazing [Music] I think just for everything that I have going on and all of the different things that my hands are in within the brand the business I need to make sure that I'm giving a hundred percent change those things so they have the highest opportunity to be successful right if I'm trying to cheat it then it's gonna show you know it's not gonna come out to the best of my ability and with that stand up you got a you got a [\\xa0__\\xa0] magnifying glass on you you know you're always being judged off of what you did at one point just like a musician you're always judged off of the album that everybody thought was whatever so the biggest thing for an entertainer artists whatever your craft is is creation how you recreating yourself how are you constantly showing that you're growing for me the only way to do that is to talk about my life and the things that grow along with me the only thing that grows along with me my experiences my family my marriage my mistakes my UPS my downs those are the things that I can talk about further because as you get older things change it gets different it's all coming from my personal opinion of me my view on me and how I see Life you can't lose material in that state mmm that's why I stay away from certain things because those things can become boring after a while for me because I don't have the knowledge of everything that I should like what well politics I don't know joke in the politics I don't I don't joke and anything that has to do with the slander of others or other communities I don't do anything divisive good for you that's my that's my biggest thing and you know this past year was was one that got a little weird because I was like you know I've really dedicated myself to breaking people together like I'm I know that was my my goal that's my priority I damn sure thought that's what I was doing on a global scale everybody all races shapes sizes whoever you are whatever you are you can come to a Kevin Hart show I have a good time so when it came off as if I was a person that was divisive that was tough you talking about the Oscar Oscar [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah this is a time where people are just looking to be upset about things a hundred they're they're not looking to looking at you Kevin Hart as just a human being like what who is he who overall super positive they're not even concentrating on that I mean think about how positive you are and yet they tried to concentrate on some jokes that you did what nine years ago it was a it's a it's a wake up call of understanding the times but it more importantly you know for me it was okay I went through it I made sure that the people of the LGBTQ community really understand it hey guys I apologized before but I'm apologizing again I'm sorry I'm not that guy I don't want you to think I'm that guy then it just became the constant conversation there never happened that it just became the constant conversation and and now it is guys I'm not only sorry I don't condone anything that has to do with hate to anybody this is no longer conversation so guys I'm gonna stop talking about it because now I feel like I'm feeding into yes what not I I know I'm not the world and public should understand and know them not because over this time period I've shown that I'm not so the apology once again I'm sorry genuinely I'm sorry but then it just kept it just it never stopped and at that point I just made a decision and I'm like guys at this point I just I'm making a decision to not talk about it anymore that doesn't mean that I'm being disrespectful to anybody that doesn't mean as I'm shutting down anything it means that for me I'm gonna stop talking about it because at this point I don't know what to do at this point I thought I thought the apology is what you wanted me to do I did it I made sure did you understand that I'm not a hateful person at Noga don't hate I did that I stepped down so I don't take attention off of that night knows people that are there to be celebrated I don't want to draw attention to myself and what's around me I step down everything I did was for the better of good I'm stepping away guys because I don't want this to be a negative night or a negative thing and then it still became a conversation so I waited for it to die down I went on my radio show gave another public apology make sure doesn't he understand it I'm sorry I hope these words didn't hurt anybody I once again apologized I don't condone hate to anyone I hope that you guys can forgive me for those jokes of oh so now I say if you don't understand it you don't believe it I don't know what else to give I don't know what else to do there's nothing else you can do that's very wise of you nothing it's very wise easy to step away like that because if you didn't they would probably pursue it forever but I mean it's it becomes a point of attention that's all it is it's decided that this is something they're gonna focus on what I had a I had a good talk and I'm gonna talk about this for a minute friend of mine Lee Daniels you know man Lee Daniels Lee called me told me where to talk to you know Lee Daniels is director producer the show empire's his biggest shows you know so he calls me he's like everyone talk to you and and I was talking he's like look this is a time where you could speak up and talk about you know the community that's been affected by hatred and you know hateful crimes you can step up and be a voice and say that you don't condone or don't stand with any type of hate or whatever you can take that stage and do that and I said Lee I said that's I understand what you're saying I said well why did you expect me to know what's been happening with in this community in regards to hate and crimes I said I I'm not aware I said some people can just not be aware I'm not even no I have no idea what's going on I have no idea yes within that community I have no idea right when you tell me this I'm now educated and I understand so it's easy to simply inform right information is key when people get information they process the information when you can process the information you go oh wait a minute that makes sense hey if you guys think that I can don't hate wait a minute I don't and anybody that does [\\xa0__\\xa0] you man that's bad you shouldn't I can say that but instead when this happened it was become an ally mmm become a voice you know and that's that's where there was just a miscommunication that's where a back and forth kind of was established that I think people just started to take things and run with it and I'm just not I'm just not one to feed into what I feel isn't going to eventually evolve into a positive thing in a real conversation yes yeah when I'm trying my best to it was becoming tabloid [\\xa0__\\xa0] as opposed to like a real discussion click me yeah click click me that's the problem there's so much bait out there because it's such an effective way to get people to pay attention to things because as you said people focus on failure and negative and anger that's what we want to see controversy that's what we want to see people don't want to see the anger yeah and and you know we think that is because it's just the times it's it's that's what's cool now always being negative you know how you always have some people it's a great example how you have people mean you can talk about a movie all right we can talk about Titanic wow it's authentic one of the biggest movies of all time [\\xa0__\\xa0] great movie yes it was great movie and why guy for no reason go I [\\xa0__\\xa0] hated it yeah why yeah like Titanic [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] why manga yeah I know what tell me why'd you hate it I got time talk about that the cool thing is just being different I wanna I wanna be completely opposite Denali Contreras how the people you know what no no that [\\xa0__\\xa0] was ass what Wow Wow why was it ass we have people that just like to do this oh yeah for sure and and and what happens when one person does it another person for no reason all go yeah me too yeah she was ask man i hain't like it either did you see it what y'all talkin about you don't even know what they're talking about but you just want to hop on the negative train right because that's what's cool it's not cool to be positive it's not cool to be happy I don't know if it's a cool thing I think it's usually people that are really frustrated with their lives 100% what's the that's the factual side to it I did a joke before was like do you think Michael Jordan leaves YouTube comments like people want to get mad and complain constantly about [\\xa0__\\xa0] like that do you know what it takes to do this right here you know right here no tell you how I feel write in your comments section Joe Rogan you can kiss my you know what that takes what do you have going that you have the time to just simply be that negative and do it in this world you know someone's just a mismanagement of your time yeah it is so valuable and I don't think people understand how valuable they can be if they use their time correctly yes now have you always been like this always be sausages oh my [\\xa0__\\xa0] god man but always always really I find a light in every dark tunnel I will find a goddamn light man I hear at all you listen when I tell you to wait on my back it's so heavy of all the stuff that I deal with and I'm fine the reason why I'm fine is because I'm genuinely happy I'm happy and I'm not happy just because of the success success X is a bonus I'm happy because I truly know the definition and the feeling that comes with happiness I truly know it I felt it I felt it when I said yo what really makes me happy and I look at heaven and Hendrix and I look his oh I look at my wife I go yo I didn't have the family [\\xa0__\\xa0] when I was coming up yeah I got one I got one look what I did look what I built these people depend on me I provide these people that makes me happy that makes me happy when my daughter comes up dad you're not only my dad you're my best friend no I'm happy that's my world so everything else from the outside that comes in your your your throwing [\\xa0__\\xa0] at a at a at a bubble that can't be popped mmm it's a force field around me yeah there's a force field around me because what matters what really matters loves me wholeheartedly and when you had that and you understand that you're unbreakable so if you don't add to that force field if you don't make my force field stronger you don't you don't you don't get time for me my team heartbeat productions the people underneath my umbrella you're part of my force field you what I believe we all see the same things we want the same things so we march with the same beat you can't you can't shake that when you're an individual that seen that and understands that if you've never felt that if you have no idea what that feels like then it's easy to shake you that's why some people are easily broken being broken is not a hard thing it's not a hard thing so those that do get broken those that do get down those that do get depressed I understand I understand I don't I don't knock people for it mmm I don't not anybody for it what I also understand is that the encouragement that can come from so many can add value for those that may need a little push hmm that may need a little Amen pick your chin up it's so easy to be that positive reinforcement for somebody and add value it's so easy but some people choose to throw that aside and kick while you're down mmm I try to put out the light of positivity because whoever is out there you I don't know what it could do for somebody else but somebody else may just simply look at me say you know the way to he embraces his kids it makes me want to be a better father yo way to this man doesn't stop and await it every day he wakes up and he's just positive regardless of what's going on makes me realize that this [\\xa0__\\xa0] ain't so bad the way that he gets up and says hey today is another day it's the morning let's all be better than we were yesterday somebody probably needed to hear that the more that I can give that out and I can take my platform to throw good energy out I'm doing my part because there's so many that thought the complete opposite yeah I don't want to be a part of that that's beautiful man that's and that's true I believe you it's not it's not forced right it's not phony yeah it's not fake this [\\xa0__\\xa0] every day I hear [\\xa0__\\xa0] every day it's very contagious too I had a lady I heard a lady right [Laughter] lady rolled out a window when you gonna make a good movie again did you see the upside was good what's that oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's a movie it's one of my movies that's how us think I think it's a good movie I see that all right ma'am you have a beautiful day that's with such conviction like literally yeah I could have said a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] like she rolled a window down you could tell she still had the crank things that I could say to you ma'am when you gonna make a good movie it's napping I got one out the upside you see the outside what's that oh it's a movie so it's out now amazing it that's how she chose to come out here I see it I'm Jesus to come at you with a negative I get it every day when you'll be funny again trying my best but trying my best if it's not working for you hopefully I do better soon what do you what what am I gonna feed into that and add water right why why for what yeah for what it seems to have been working thus far are you getting this positive attitude towards life from life experience are you getting it from books did someone teach you how to find this I'm getting it from the experiences and from the the real understanding of perfection doesn't exist don't exist Oh mmm we're in a time right now where people expect perfection you expect perfection I don't know where dust came from I don't know what happened that this is the criteria for living my true understanding is all right you got one life and then one life the goal for us is to live it to the best of our ability from the beginning so what said the end in the middle in the beginning middle you're gonna do things you're gonna make mistakes you're gonna [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you're supposed to learn and then move forward with the understanding of what not to do and when you move forward life may get better it may not but somewhere along the lines is gonna click and everything that I went through back here was supposed to happen so that now that I'm here I'm able to go ahead with such a high level of knowledge and I can make other people better I can make myself better I could do more for my family something happens my dad is the prime example crazy drug addict in and out of jail life was very bad very [\\xa0__\\xa0] bad my dad son got successful son then took money gave it to his dad here's your house here's your truck here's your monthly at this age I want you to live your life you know made mistakes you can't rebuild and correct the things you've done I'm your son I love you you can't go back in and redo you can't try to keep going backwards ain't about me you got grandkids mmm gonna be the best grand pop you could be for these grandkids that's your focus now where's this energy devoted to being a grand pop for the grandkids don't worry about me but something happened in your life something happened that took you in the direction to reap the benefits of your son's happiness and success my energy is now contagious nothing I hand it to you so now you're able to give that off to all these other people that you're around something happens and that's in every single life in every life I understand that there's a payoff for bad eventually there's a payoff it can't be bad but for so long if you got the strength and the understanding to realize that [\\xa0__\\xa0] will change it will change it's impossible just like poker I don't know if you play poker or not I don't you play poker you can run bad forever but it will eventually turn around once you grasp the understanding of the game eventually it's gonna turn around blackjack you're never gonna be the casino but eventually you're gonna have a good run if you catch you run you'll do good get the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of there you waited long enough for it to happen here come catch it leave anything in life will eventually turn good no but this is coming just from your own personal experience have any role models that I'm up to you this way Nancy art did she speak to you like this about positivity and about my mom reinforced knowledge my mom reinforced you don't start things and not finish them you don't quit there's nothing that comes out of quitting besides knowing that you didn't finish we finish everything you started finish it if you're gonna do it do it to try and be the best not be better than other people be the best for you if you're in school and you're going to class I'm not asking you to get straight A's I'm asking you to get the best grade that you can possibly get give me a hundred percent all the time and I'm a happy mother when you half-ass me I'm on yes mom I want to do this I wanna I want to play baseball well then you gonna play my mom like that no more then why'd you start the season because I thought I wanted to do it then you gonna finish the season you don't quit there's other people that invested time and energy into you you don't just quit on people but I don't want to do it finish the season mom I want to swim then you gonna finish swim it didn't matter what I did I was never allowed to quit so now in anything I do when I pick it up a say i'ma start it I got to finish it it all don't work it all ate the best hmm it all ain't knocked out the park but I walk away saying I finished it I did it I did it right now I've been boxing I saw I saw you working out with Rico Verhoeven I'm [\\xa0__\\xa0] first of all very strong kicker huge man okay he's a big guy too man good guy but I started in jeans I started it and I said why am I doing this I'm not gonna be a professional fighter I'm not trying to be a amateur fighter I'm doing the guiness shape alright then I start getting shaped I said you know so much that I don't know about the sport I at least want to make sure that I'm paying homage to the people that do this for a living by really understanding and learning it you know what I'm gonna get a real trainer I'm getting some real people to show me everything so when it's all said and done and I look back after my training I can go I gave it 100% and look at how good I got look at what I'm a product of a spar I go getting really yeah yeah just to feel it so I can say it you know well sparse Bryan Callen is this serious no it's me yeah that's me come on that's me dude that's me it's getting it to look at this who is teaching him uh his name is Biggs he's in Atlanta that's me learn I had a turtle shell within punches but you know he's a former Golden Glove guy really good to you were in a cup and everything when I was at the sparring session when I'm I grow tired damn yeah I got touched I got my ass whipped and every couple times I go guys worried about that all good I don't go crazy we had gear and but I'm not in there with guys that are trying to hurt yes I'm not in there was touching guys that have no concept of reality yeah or control like they're they're just helping me understand right here's why you have to keep yeah that is a problem with celebrities trying to spar like if you try to like you know that's why Mickey Rourke started getting all that facial surgery I'm serious he's part of James Toney Jesus lashes she's not a smart right here that's James Tony's a mean man and it's just not you can't like I don't I don't go in that space have you ever seen James Tony talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] boys bars and there's some of the most entertaining thing you'll ever find on YouTube he's just he just won't shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up beating your ass he's talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's her and he's one of the best defensive fighters ever so he's really difficult to hit he's got that smells fresh and a in the world yeah I had a guy who's got any Mikey I'm sparring with Mikey Mikey hit me with three punches I thought I thought Mikey literally had like six arms this is the true story this I said I don't know what just happened but I thought I had my hands up in no matter where I put him he just tapped me he lets me feel it but not to where I might getting knocked out but I understand now movement I understand pivots I understand shoulder protection and that's my goal my goal is just understand cuz I can't do anything halfway okay if you try to fight somebody nope right nope I just want to say that I did it and I learn and I can move and I look the part cuz I put time into it well as you learn it too as you watch and you start get trained then you start to look at a guy like Terence Crawford or lumen Co and you go oh now I appreciate what you're doing because before you'd see like oh yeah I beat that guy up oh yeah he knocked that guy out but then you see like how he ducks under the left and fires back with the right you know Jesus this is precision it's insane yeah the the respect that I have for people that do that on a day to day is through the roof yeah and people that fight are in the most amazing shape in the universe yeah you're in the most amazing shape ever to move get hit for three to five minutes around come back do it come back do it and these fights go on and on and on I take my hat off to you yeah you get three rounds out of me I'm breathing out my butt I don't know where the air is coming from I'm searching for it it's a crazy way to make a living to money in your brain thank God I don't I didn't have to go down that route and you know to those that do just make sure you just put your body first like you said it's a it's hurtful when you see the damage that it can call us yeah we were talking about that earlier like seeing guys as they start to deteriorate and it's hard because nobody wants to tell him that either every I want to tell them they got one more good fighting them and let's uh maybe at the end of the year then we'll decide but right now we're gonna train hard and my stuff it's hard to cuz there's no option so they don't once you've established yourself as a professional fighter and you don't have an exit strategy you don't know what to do you know now at least thankfully because of the internet guys are getting podcasts and they're starting doing commentary shows they're talking about fighting and it's the positive you just found the positive that's the positive within the internet that is positive you just don't you just don't hear it celebrate it as much well the Internet's very positive for me I mean this is the show we do on the Internet I mean all not just podcast but YouTube videos and also information I know more because of the internet than I ever would have without it there's not a not doubt in my mind a more educated more aware person I want just the Internet yeah you get the things that you're able to find and search and I mean like you said you're you're able to self-educate yeah at a very high level these are the goods yeah we're talking about the goods so when you talk about positive Kevin how have you been yeah are you always like that it's this it's the things that I look at that are so easy you're not just positive though you're look crazy ambitious that's the thing that gets me about you in the rock for sure it's like the ambitions off the charts like I know your riches [\\xa0__\\xa0] like when when do you think you got enough you don't have enough there's no doesn't know enough I don't have enough because it's not over it's all over it's not over so you know when when you put a cap on it you're putting a punctuation to it mm-hmm and the the the ambition comes from seeing what's out there that can be obtained you know when you see what's out there like what can you mean physical things like well you see what's out there when you see where people are really gaining wealth and knowledge from okay the business relationships that you're able to acquire the people that you're able to partner with and create certain things different revenue streams what I found is as a young black guy from North Philadelphia the biggest problem with the biggest problem within our community is knowledge we don't know debt debt is welcomed because it's celebrated that's all we know and I'm get that credit card oh my [\\xa0__\\xa0] that credit card up and it is what it is they gotta figure that out I ain't got it after that yeah well you know what I'm getting student loans they gave it to me then after that [\\xa0__\\xa0] is I'm figured out I put a cable bill in your name you put it in my name we can switch it up whatever they do it there let's just put it in someone else name its welcome the Hustle is welcome the knowledge of banks and what you can do it can't do is it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] you don't even get it cuz you go to check cashing places reason like go check cash place because I don't want go through that ship the banks I'll trust that go right there to check heads please let me get mine let me get mine now take $30 whatever let me get it the knowledge is given so it's not to you obtain that knowledge and understanding that you go oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh this is why you put money up oh this is this is how you increase versus decrease oh this is how you earn on your money oh wow I can gain wealth by investing in what the stock world is what how many people partake in a stock world and is there a part that isn't necessarily gambling is there a low-risk part these that's not the information isn't there so it's not so I got to a certain level and a certain group of people where I got it and now that I got it I want to give it so now I'm going to give it I'm gonna give it to the people that I know need it most and for me that younger generation of black people that don't understand the cool thing is in financial longevity not in a now it's not in the moment for jewelry not in the moment for the car it's in the longevity it's in building so at the end of the day you can say look at what I have look at what I worked for look at what I have that's mine monopoly is real but you have to have the financial understanding and I teamed up I got chased I never done something called financial fitness where's just about me educating people on money how to manage money how to how to be smart with your money but it's coming from a person that [\\xa0__\\xa0] that money I didn't always understand it I hold in taxes before because I didn't understand it in the beginning I've had bad credit credit cards wouldn't take me because I maxed out whatever I've been there I've done it thank God I was able to fix it and get on the right path and now that I have the knowledge I want to give it could simply don't know so when you say the end game the end game is getting to a point where I've taken all the knowledge that I've been able to get over these years and really applying it and providing family wealth when it's all said and done the last-named heart is gonna mean just more a lot more than just Kevin Hart and comedy heart beat production it's got heartbeat digital your heartbeat ventures your heartbeat real estate there's so many things that the last-named heart will be attached to you real estate Kevin Hardin sell real estate a Bible stand by it but the reason why is because investment investment but but as you get older you learn this you learn it and and you know it's such a thing where you talk about black versus white you know a lot of people do that and and I flee so like there is racism racism exists I'm not unaware of that but there is a high volume of it that's that's non-existent people had a good people and when you can merge yourself with good people and follow the paths that you see that these good successful people have taken you then become a part of a world and group that nobody expected you to be it so for me I now have the position to do that and take all of these relationships and all this knowledge and take it back to the people that need it most I like to share I don't want it all by myself now are you doing this and the financial stuff you're doing this in videos you like releasing videos no we're gonna start we're gonna start financial fitness like I said with chase JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon very good guy to Shanda is well they're there helped leading in charge of saying how can we get to the people that we feel need the financial information of most so I said put me out there like let's let's go directly to the consumer so from colleges from high schools senior classes junior classes going out and talking to people before they go into the next stages of their life a lot of things that you should know so you're gonna speak to them and just share personal information are you gonna put this stuff online as well yeah yeah you'll be able to track and find content from it but I'm authentic so I said the best way to really do it is to put me in a position to be heard right I want to be heard like like it's a different story what I explained to the the people of JPMorgan Chase just when we were talking about this and as an amazing board of people that are just figuring this out and the best way to go and do it and I said you can't have the white guy that's never been to the hood or who's not from the hood or has no idea how the economy works here and what the real troubles are you can't throw that man in the situation to talk to people because I'm not listening to you from the gate because you don't relate I don't relate to you but throwing somebody in a situation that's lived it that's been in it that's been [\\xa0__\\xa0] up in it made it out of it and is now coming back to help run it's a different ballgame and that's what I want to be and you know we have other voices outside of myself very powerful voices that are going to do it as well but the purpose is to align ourselves to really make a change so you can either be the conversation about making change you can be actual a part of the action to do it I want to be a part of the action and in doing it you'll also be able to understand my drive you'll get why I do so much you'll get why my hand is in so much because I have access to it and the question should be why not yeah the question shouldn't be yo why is he doing everything he should be why aren't you why aren't you trying to do everything why not well that's the thing about a guy like you that becomes contagious like what you were saying about surrounding yourself with positive people and people that are constantly ambitious and that that there's fuel to that you feel good about that that's what you're doing I can I can say seeing you here right we walked around you show me a facility loved it beautiful facility you talk to me about how your podcast is grown to where you are now the success behind it I don't leave here and go yo that's dope of [\\xa0__\\xa0] I go hey I need to do more work on my radio station laugh out loud radio I own it it's mine I got a show on there but you know a Joe [\\xa0__\\xa0] motivated me to do more I want to make sure that we understand really what's out here within his radio world because I just saw my guy in his space and I saw happy he is what success he has I don't want to be you or beat you I want to take this energy and apply it to myself that's the purpose of seeing yeah that's the purpose of being smart with your eyeballs you should be a sponge so I'm a sponge so I come here and I look at how you maneuver I look at your setup I not only bow down and congratulate you I leave and I said yo man I'm inspired dude that's dope as hell John can't wait in two years you gonna call me you gonna see my [\\xa0__\\xa0] you remember I said I was inspired but you're gonna see what I let it grow into that's the proper way to get encouraged in motivating right as opposed to being a hater a hater and in competitive yeah i'ma beat you it's not a competition yeah I'm not interested in that either and I share the exact same feelings it's not a competition at all yeah so if you don't have people like that that are inspiring around you you might not know how positive it is and how it how powerful it is if you see someone that's on television or on social media and you see them it's hard to be inspired you don't know them but you're I can say look at your circle right and in your circle if the conversation is all about what we hate I can't stay in that song you see the new [\\xa0__\\xa0] car came out okay this [\\xa0__\\xa0] is ass I can't stand that [\\xa0__\\xa0] car yo man I can't stay in this city what [\\xa0__\\xa0] we even in the city what we eatin I hate that place it's so easy if you people don't even listen to it it's so easy to be the smallest [\\xa0__\\xa0] in the world the smaller [\\xa0__\\xa0] but if it's always hate can't stand these [\\xa0__\\xa0] headphones why we got these headphones ladies like a horrible day why the buzz here [\\xa0__\\xa0] that Stan it's hard whatever hate harwood how could you get a private table [\\xa0__\\xa0] hate this [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] chairs you're got better chairs I hate these chips it's so easy right so easy it's so easy to talk about yeah yeah and so many people don't realize that in a group you do it you ping-pong hate off on them yeah unless it's funny it can be funny just between yourselves trees yeah Patrice was it was one of the best funny one of the best 20 haters okay okay you bring up a good point comedic hate McConaughey yeah communicate one of the not one of the probably the best Patrice Patrice I remember when I would talk and if I was saying something you just hear what would you tell buddies what what are you talking about you like just the way you talk but what your voice everything about your voice just makes me want to punch you in the face we talking about when he would go after you - it kind of made you feel good - like if you're a comments especially if your comic like I called Opie and Anthony once I was talking them and Anthony anything he always has a gun on him Harry's a gun everywhere like he has a concealed carry permit and [\\xa0__\\xa0] and I said to him I said do you ever worry that maybe you're putting out this energy and you're manifesting something like some sort of an attack on you because you're constantly dwelling on it you always have this gun and Patrice goes don't believe in magic don't believe me conjuring up the world he would go after you man it's like you just want to step back and watch I don't know but he got bill burr so Marilyn Oh bill used to get so [\\xa0__\\xa0] mad beautiful thing about Bill Barbara would be snap at bill bill is the guy that's not funny where's the punch line in it there's no punch line he was so [\\xa0__\\xa0] mad we the Comedy Cellar the days that we had there man bill burr Patrice O'Neal Keith Robinson Jim Norton Colin Quinn myself when I say we would sit at this table we would set this table for four to five hours and it would be nothing but beautiful trash ins to one another when I say they used to give me so much [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's probably why it's so hard to bother me now the trash ins that I took from the age 20 to 24 and my young comedic career about how awful I was I had a joke I had a joke where to begin into my career cuz at the times let me preface this this was way in the beginning of my career this was a joke that I had about about little people midgets at the time and it's you know it was so bad cause I got robbed by a cross-eyed Mitch and the joke was I didn't know he was robbing me because I was with somebody else so he was looking at my friend but he was robbing me it was like a play on being crisis very very awful joke I remember telling his joke in a phone book comes flying on the stage put trees through a [\\xa0__\\xa0] phone book at me I told him this isn't where the Boston comedy club people in a crowd tiny little place all you heard was and you sit back it hits the floor I said and Patrice said read it it's better material in it than what you're saying that crawls does laughs oh he's uh they all might say they used to trash me so bad so bad man do you alleged a retreat some news story a corporate trees jerking off at my house before this is I moved to LA I'm saying the two double partment I just got there Patrice coming out I said yo you need place ass I got two bedrooms you can come near it's my ex-wife at the time you know I come home it's like afternoon like Patrice mi yo you all but tres but race I go out in the bag open up the door I said his big-ass computer oh I see is his back hunched over so baby oil right and I come in on my door he'll get out get out get out [Laughter] he's so sick he's so sick that he didn't stop he was so concerned with finishing then he didn't even break stride and turn around and not really nothing he get out yeah you just saw his back hunched he came out like seven minutes late it was like my bad i may use come home [\\xa0__\\xa0] for treatment I love him to death love him to death yeah he had the most don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] of any time I ever met it was most 100% yeah good and bad yeah you know there yeah there was a good to it and there was also some bad you know a lot of things that didn't have been for Patrese probably could have happened but I think the the level of not give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah prevented some of those things well he was almost too authentic yes like his like gypsy that was it Charlie Sheen's roast whose roast was it that he did what he just torture everybody else on the roast and then he got up there and you guys the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is this [\\xa0__\\xa0] who is this [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh my god Patrice has so many of those things yeah so many of things one of one of the best to do it if you if you are listening you're not educated I'm Patrice O'Neal just I ask did you just watch Elvin in the room one of his specials yeah some of that some of the funniest [\\xa0__\\xa0] ever man and so insightful mmm-hmm he was so why the way people thought and behaved he would say [\\xa0__\\xa0] like one of the things that he said that I I tell people all the time it's a it's a brilliant thing that he said it was forget what controversy it was but he was on television with some woman who was saying that you should never tell jokes about certain things you know and they were they were getting mad at someone I think it was Opie and Anthony about a joke and he said you gotta understand that all jokes come from the same place the ones you like and the ones you don't like the ones that make you laugh and the ones that make you mad they all come from the same place someone's just trying to be funny yeah like sometimes they just don't work I had a talk I had a talk with the I forgot her name I got I forgot her name but it was when I was doing all the promo for upside and they kept trying to break down you know where where where the jokes come from you know Kevin these insensitive jokes in that you told back then why what what makes you why would you even say those things and the hardest thing for me to explain I was like do you think people think of jokes and while thinking of them think that they're not going to be funny everything that you think of in a joke form you're thinking of it because you think you're gonna get a laugh behind it yeah the gamble is if I get the lab versus not get the lab don't get the laughs the joke was not funny if I get a laugh then I guess I'm on to something there isn't a bunch of thought that goes into the funny moments that we think may be great bits yeah I wish that I had a more logical answer to put behind it I said I don't especially at that time my career I just thought it would be funny the same way that some people think sir jokes funny the offer it's a thought comedians are constantly throwing [\\xa0__\\xa0] out there yeah you're constantly rolling a dice and Thor [\\xa0__\\xa0] out there had to [\\xa0__\\xa0] you roll and good right it's not gonna be good the other hatten maybe all right maybe kind of good but it's all with the intent of entertaining it's not with the intent of being malicious it's not with the intent of sparking hatred it's all trying to make you laugh yeah that's it like it's it's literally that simple from a thought within the comedian's mind yeah nothing nothing else they kept trying to look for this like hard definition of why and it's like I don't have it I don't have the reason why I thought it would be funny and it wasn't that's the downfall that's it that's it it's it's and the thing is about this art form is that up until ten fifteen years ago there was never any discussion like this it wasn't so so when we developed and when we were coming up there was no it was just like and there was always guys that would push the envelope way too far I believe Jesus Christ you see his new bid what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah and you'd be laughing yeah you tell it to each other and yeah and it didn't matter what it was joke about murder or rape or what some people just use those dark subjects like they're trying to make us laugh yeah in the meetings the comedian's comedian there's always gonna be though well you just innovate you all do you know Brian Holtzman 100% yeah but in Holtzman's that guy 100% my funniest dudes and and and there's no way that I could say no some of the stuff that I heard me say remember Susan Smith that lady who drowned her kids I I know I know who you're talking about her and I know the moment but I'm not familiar with all all that involved Holtzman was on stage that week and he's like I heard those kids were bad I heard they set that close to the TV they never put away their blocks there we spilt their milk those kids will not be missed yeah and you were just like oh I in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] like 9/11 when 9/11 happened they wouldn't let him on stage well Mitzi shore would not let him on stage four months after 9/11 she's like no way keep him off the stage I mean do you have you have the people just Sartre did they go for that they go for because they want to hear you howl and get back to the room do you know that like if it's you know comics are there in the back of the room they're gonna laugh their [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass off at that chair and and you know it's weird because right now within a times I'm the comedian that chooses to be sensitive to the times you know I've made the choice to say I understand I get why you shouldn't say certain things why you should avoid this that or this I I understand and I am but then there's other comedians that go you know what I'm more staged I'm gonna be me and I'm not gonna do that because people are telling me that this is what I I'm gonna go harder yeah and do that that's yeah that just exists it just exists but I think it's easier to just say I'm not a fan that comedy isn't for me right you know what I don't I don't like the taste of this particular comedian so I'm not going to support a watch that comedian I'm gonna find another comedian there's more to my liking I'm going to go and just turn my head like I want us to get back to just understanding that you just don't have to support it yeah that's it well there's a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] option it's very I mean there's so many today yeah there's never been more never been more comics I think about how many people were doing Netflix specials so many's never been more it's something so easy so I don't understand why there's a push to destroy which you just don't have to support it like I think it's just a bunch of people that have an ability to influence things now that didn't have an ability before and it's like they see a window and they want to throw a rock it's right there makes sense I think there's something that but I also think mm-hmm for us like meat for me in particular I really like [\\xa0__\\xa0] up comedy it's one of my fits like I like Quentin Tarantino movies where people get shot and killed yeah I don't want anybody get shot and killed in real life yeah but I like [\\xa0__\\xa0] up comedy yeah do you know Tim Dylan is yes I do pull up that [\\xa0__\\xa0] video that him being mega Kane he is a savage dude he goes so hard but I saw this video I was tears rolling down my eyes I was crying and I was like okay this guy's needed we need this right now because during this political correct push you got this big giant gay dude who doesn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] let me seize an animal watch this [\\xa0__\\xa0] and we're going to it will be raised in captivity it'll be raised privately to be the greatest politician that has ever had my name is Megan McCain and I'm on a new show we have you see this to folks that [\\xa0__\\xa0] riverboat casino catherine is talking about my father again my father was tortured for a hundred years for this [\\xa0__\\xa0] country and he came back and he started seven wars because he's a gentleman [\\xa0__\\xa0] you try I'm gonna wear my father's skin mask and I'm gonna primary from the right if you don't know he's wearing lipstick and a dress oh my goodness that's pretty damn that's out there they need that guy we need him it's out there we need guys like that I mean just talking about what we said it's like it's just it's very easy to just to just say you know what that's not me behind what is like for me yes advice humor is different I laugh I laugh there's a rhythm there's a viral video it is this old guy trying to hoverboard he's like [\\xa0__\\xa0] he's gotta be like 69 70 and you know his grandkids there and he's like let me let me try it let me try it and this man gets on this hover board and takes if you saw Mike Tyson fall on a hoverboard his fall was worse than Mike Tyson's I've never seen somebody hit their head harder in my life and I didn't laugh out of wanting to see this old man hurt herself I laughed because it was stupid to try to get on his hoverboard in the first place and when he got up he tells the kids why is it moving like this this video everybody because that [\\xa0__\\xa0] made me laugh some people were watching oh no no some people were watching to go oh oh oh another one just died [\\xa0__\\xa0] laughing because everybody's humor is different yeah humor is different my humor is different falling makes me laugh okay we're you are falling makes me laugh I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] who you are if you fall in front of me no shot I'm holding there laughs there's no shot you don't stand a chance if you there's no shot that I'm not bust your ass something something's got to come out right falling is funny I still think it's hacky I still think farts are funny when my kids fart I laugh I still to this day it's the funny [\\xa0__\\xa0] every me that goes that V you stick get out of it stay gas my little son 17 months when you fart I laugh something something within just ability to just be [\\xa0__\\xa0] silly and GOP oh yeah it doesn't always have to have a meaning behind it some [\\xa0__\\xa0] is just stupid my eight-year-old farts on cue she thinks it's hilarious genius she'll tell you that listen I gotta talk to you about something that's laughing she think it's hilarious she'll fall down the couch she can't stop laughing that's all you got it's your only bit as a kid nothing else but farts that's all you got that's all you've got to make people laugh you should enjoy it no he should think it's funny folly but falling is number one for me falling is number one my wife fell down the steps she got so mad cuz I didn't rush to help her I laugh she had a wine glass wine with all over the walls oh my god what are the worst Falls I've ever seen in my damn lap got up her shoe was on one step the shoe was all follow us funny I like it I don't laugh have fallen that much I just deal with too many injuries I've seen too many people get hurt it's not for you yeah especially old dudes fallen down hitting their head on Mike I start thinking about brain trauma and CTE long-term repercussions I'm near I'm right there with you it's probably better I'm right there with you there's the one that's going on today of this dude trying to come up the stairs on this other dude did you see that one the guy stomped them and set him flying like all I could think of is we don't see it in the video but that guy's head it's got to be smithereens oh my god he he had hit his head the way he fell back yeah you ever seen one of the guy who slipped and fell down a bunch of steps at the museum and falls in the water yeah he's going it goes in water Dumbo right you can't you can't beat that there's this dude this goes walking up the stairs and this dude's legs get the [\\xa0__\\xa0] off my porch stop leave me alone and he keeps coming he's like don't do it don't do it and he got boom smack the way he fell back you know hands behind him that's all head that's all head first of all to not see that kick coming yeah from a guy that says it's sad but you also have to realize a guy that size is carrying all that weight of a donkey kick yes that's just caved in my got stomped but to not see it once again I always thought that about fat people but if you really really fat imagine how strong your [\\xa0__\\xa0] legs must be strongly should ever yeah if you really get some power behind that kick and also if you've lost the weight you'd have these incredible legs that's a that's always a theory just it's Anthony but I was wonder if their needs are gonna shrink it wait what because you see someone from behind they're like 500 pounds like their knees are that wide I'm like okay is that the bone like is that fat around the bone like has the bone grown really wide too cuz your body does your bones do get denser if you do like heavy weight mmm like this if you look at like power lifter dudes they're do they're dense well part of it is not just their frame it's that they're constantly lifting heavy things so your body thickens up did you as you go but you know when when you know people that are larger make the the dedication to actually losing the weight and they stay away from like the weights and stuff and just do cardio it sheds off so fast yeah but he can't like I know I know a couple of friends of mine and lost like 130 140 pounds and like if now just fallen in love with fitness to the point where it's unbelievable like how their body is transformed and taking a liking to the new the new process that they're now in pretty yeah they get addicted instead of food they get addicted to being healthy exactly it's totally possible totally possible I've had I don't know how many people come up to me and said they've lost a hundred pounds plus because of listening to my show and having fitness experts on and diet experts and and just talking about staying the [\\xa0__\\xa0] away from sugar say don't eat late at night yes that's eating stop eating in a certain time and give yourself more than enough time to digest Cal your calories start exercising well with me I think the thing with me that helps me so much as I'm not a foodie you're not I'm not a foodie

multivitamins which inspired me to start doing my home like right now we got bicycle okay I'm starting my own supplement line vitae hustle love to vitamin that we put out but let me tell you why doe I'm gonna tell you why I'm even getting into this space so when I look at physical fitness and I look at this world I noticed that you know you have a you have a great one in need to look like everything around you that you see like everybody like everybody that's a part of this world they look so [\\xa0__\\xa0] great and fit when they're talking about these products and the things they can do and I said you know what what I'm able to do and what I've done in my past I'm always bringing people together of all like in whole like there is nobody's alienated you know when I did my runs with Nike and before I got signed by Nike it was about bringing a bunch of people that never ran before and getting you guys to get up just come run with me just try it and you notice I got people out that never thought they were [\\xa0__\\xa0] do it and we doing five miles we don't ten miles whatever it's just a group run something to say we did I said how can I create a product where I'm putting people in a position to understand there's a hustle in all of us that's what my multivitamin is about it's the energy is the recharge it's the ability to focus is to approach your day with all of the tools that you basically need it's not just about the physical fitness aspect it's about the health so if I can actually motivate people to take the step in the right direction of health with a line of supplements that are driven for the everyday individual that may not know or be aware but wants to engage but you're not in it to look like all these different people you're in it to be the best version of yourself how can I do that teamed up with a great group of people to create the best possible products that I want to do and I said I want to be patient so it took me for you four years to create about us and how many different products you go right now just by dose vitae Hustle is my only one right now so it's just a vitamin just a multivitamin but it's an amazing multivitamin is it a single pill or is it a packet but no it's a it's a jar I should have [\\xa0__\\xa0] bought one good job a jar Jesus Christ so you like mix it in some stuff no it's a jar full like all pills yes pills okay um I'm gonna tell you the dope stuff this that's in it cuz I don't want to not say anything in and have it to where it's wrong so I always got it up on the screen man good Jesus Christ I get it hey you guys see it yep that's why you here we're gonna save that on my phone blueberry fruit extract scroll scroll back up there boron biotin beta-carotene vitamin A mmm-hmm what's all good [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's all good [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's more than a multivitamin I'll plan him in a it's good II what does that stuff Toco Toco trend all teletran out talk--i channels vitamin E family mm-hmm-hmm you ever heard of that Jim vitamin K look it up alright look it up it's a good thing too is that everything that's in it you know it's not only is it researchable but you'll see why like my biggest thing like as a guy that's not as familiar with the space I said who are the people that are they do it at a high level that I can incorporate into helping me build this product so I feel like you're never gonna do it by yourself you shouldn't try to do by yourself and you don't cut corners you don't go to cheap route you don't you don't do it wrong something you have to go back to do it again Brian so I went and I looked at the people that were involved with creating the quote-unquote best markets the best things on the market and I put that team together I put up a team like four to five I'm gonna tell you for years spent a lot of money developing this [\\xa0__\\xa0] because it wasn't right in the beginning had to go back had to do it again wasn't right had to go back find out the other things they made other things better of things great had to go right go get it again go try it go do it again not right what else is out there what are we compared to until I felt that now when I launch there's going to be a place for my product in the market where people will understand that is exactly what I said it was there's no lying there is no you know false presentation behind the product Kevin Hartz multivitamins much more than multivitamin but more importantly it's something for everybody and more importantly it's to spark the hustle within all of us and it's the first there will be more but it'll be after I've mastered and done this at the highest level then I moved to product number two then I moved to product number three before you know it you want to see a [\\xa0__\\xa0] whole line that Kevin Hart is slowly developed and that people can actually believe in because I'ma be a product of my own product that's the best thing in the world when you're a product of your product has to work for me before I say it's gonna work for everybody else so you take this stuff goddamn right I take it how long am I taking it I spent all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] money I better take it I've been taking the the one that's launching now for about five to six months nice I've been taking this one I'm very happy because I actually feel the difference and the difference is just in the energy that you have with him day it's not an energy [\\xa0__\\xa0] pill but I do feel a difference in my in my ability to last throughout my day like I'm I do a lot man I do it [\\xa0__\\xa0] light so I told you I'm starting at that final 5:30 and I'm not shutting down to let 9 10 I saw a video once where you were taking a video of your your trainer passed out yeah like this lifestyle everybody very unattractive sleeper by the way shots out to Tim boss Ronald over line and one of the worst sleepers you have a seat so you take him with you everywhere yeah my trainers let me everywhere Wow everywhere so you train every day every day Wow every day Sunday's are light days like cardio maintenance is what we call it not doing the same thing all the time we switch it up love switching about love finding new things within Fitness to make it fun you never want to get bored within it so your your whole purpose is just to keep your vitality up keep your energy up just to keep it it's if I don't do it then there's a lag I need to train I need to do it because I I'm mentally so invested in it now that when I don't do it I feel like I've cheated myself in a in a day or a week that I've taken off I feel like yo man I'm not myself because when I am doing it I feel like I'm always I'm committed I'm committed to constantly building and reshaping and molding I'm working on me so when I'm not working on me I don't feel like my day that's supposed to be about me it's starting off with the biggest bang right this is my advantage to starting off like nobody else my day starts off before [\\xa0__\\xa0] worms and birds get up I'm we're time to get up five five and that's when you start working out Jim 5:15 5:20 really 5:15 5:20 no food I don't eat I don't need before workout yeah I'm not I'm not I eat it before I workout never had didn't know what I am now because I'm getting older I'm more conscious of my body so I'm big with sports massages I'm big with you know making sure that I'm not putting myself in a position to get injured and overwork right so getting stretched you know trying to to do as much movement that as I possibly can like when I say I'm a little walking muscle I really AM so my flexibility is limited so right now that's my biggest focus so I'm about to start yoga trying to do that things that can just kind of keep me in a position to to not tighten up so I don't pull anything cuz I do so much are you gonna do hot yoga yeah do that [\\xa0__\\xa0] all the time do you roll it love it amazing do it every week yeah only thing that's kept me from doing it is the smell and it's possibly you never that's the only thing that's kept me out of it I was like you gotta move past that yeah blessa I hear I get pretty bad sometimes it can yeah the place I go to is nice you just gotta make sure that the people take care of themselves well you know he'll be around smelly people I'll be honest I'm worried about myself I don't know what I'm gonna get especially if you get there early in the morning you know eat you won't worry about farting yeah but the people that eat breakfast yeah go they are letting off and everything I'll explain that the killer Mikey was talking to me about farting in yoga class I'm the guy can't be eating no can't be eating before that early are you going I like to go either 6:00 a.m. which is rare most of time 8:00 8:00 8:30 depends on where which place I go to - but you love it though yeah it's great for your head - it's 90 minutes of suffering you know it's hot it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] you hundred five degrees hundred four degrees when you get out of there you feel like you did something really yeah and it just changes the way your body feels - in terms of your range of motion your flexibility all those weird connecting knots and everything just get opened up and you know my question is when you when you're just starting no yeah like like I will be is it extremely tough and a beginning again you just just gotta bring a lot of ice water just bring a big ol [\\xa0__\\xa0] 64 ounce one of those of you know thermal flasks of ice water make sure you have enough water and drink enough water before it I'm talking put me in a bag yeah just start now I don't need to be what people could see me just we got like a section in the back yeah well you turn left you turn right everyone's gonna see you yes I'm saying can I be in a place where they go see me in the beginning like I don't want anybody to see you're athletic man you're gonna be fine you're gonna be tight it's gonna be difficult for you to pull off certain poses but you'll be fine I'm definitely gonna do it I'm definitely realize it's a challenge I'm definitely 100% gonna try your [\\xa0__\\xa0] would you do too no that's next yeah that's next Justin I'm just on here listen this is where Rico was laughing because I say oh man don't laugh annotators I've never thrown a kick as I said whatever you show me right now is my first time doing it I don't I don't kick I don't know how to kick right so whatever you show me this is this will be me processing it for the first time and that day we did it we worked on and I think I threw a couple good kicks a couple good front kick and I said I said look after I'm done with boxing I said this will be my next test to learn how to probably throw some kicks and to move with my bottom half now that I've worked on my top that's my next hobby that's your next time you know jiu-jitsu is like that's the tough one in choice and you want to do that too I'm just this stuff as you get older you have to find [\\xa0__\\xa0] to do right if you don't find [\\xa0__\\xa0] to do you won't lose your mind you would get addicted to that I just wanna learn [\\xa0__\\xa0] you would like it because there's so much to learn that's the thing about it it's a long long never ending never ending never ending journey of [\\xa0__\\xa0] there's also there's so many different variations of each different individual move and entries into new moves and defense and then the structure of it is it's it gets so crazy it's it's super complicated my son my son does a my son is heavy into boxing in karate I got him meant to those so he he does them both so the reason why I want to do I just like to keep up with him so we can you know do things together I have trainers come to the house and we'll work out together he loves it so I just don't want to get left behind that you know we get 1718 which we'll say Dave I don't want that but we better back up when they start getting that much confidence I just want to be able to keep up and maintain so that's why I like to do it with them well it's good for a kid to to have that in your head which is not a defense confidence yeah you need that for confident it'll help you avoid things too well I tell my kids you know your last name puts a target on your back that you didn't ask for and we don't go and create problems but you should always be prepared for problems if they were to occur and if they do I just want you guys to know how to defend yourself so the things that I have my kids doing it just have the knowledge and understanding the worst thing is just not knowing you know they're growing up completely different than I grew up where I grew up you had no choice but to know if you ain't know how to fight that's your ass cuz you're gonna get tested there's no way around it you're gonna get tried you're gonna get robbed you're gonna get your bookbag take it it's am I gonna try to take snakes like it's the reality it's not a false reality that's real so if you're not prepared for it if you don't have any type of heart you won't last from where I grew up heart was everything and heart was sometimes saying I don't care if I get my ass whooped I'm not gonna be a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie y'all to think that this can't happen so I'm gonna lose today but tomorrow I'm gonna complain and imma firin you imma talk whatever that moment was it was about establishing any level of respect that you could and I respect the eventually turned into friendship from all so my kids don't know what that world is like they're never gonna have it so as a parent I just have to make sure that you have all the tools that I can possibly equip you with because my president have the ability to provide me with it they weren't a financial space to to take me here and have this extra curricular activity or this extra curricular activity or learn it learn it then exist that is the big conundrum of successful Hebert can actually when successful people have kids the what made them successful is dry I grew up poor too we were on welfare and food stamps the whole deal when I was a little kid and that always stuck in my head this thought like we might not have enough food like I remember thinking that when I was a little like what if we don't have any food what if we run out of food my kids will never feel that they don't understand what that is and everybody that I've ever met that's interest came from some crazy struggle yeah when they were young yeah and that's the thing of your you and I and most people that are doing well in life you're raising your kids in a completely different way then literally what brought you to the dance and the first that's the hunger of not being one of those people that's left behind is what makes you successful in the first place and it's scary it's scared because you know my wife my wife told me she was like you know I love that you're not hard on your kids but you always make sure there's a lesson within your conversation like I don't yell I'll yell at my kids nothing's gonna register when I'm yelling so I tried my best to talk to you everyone I met my angriest I'm gonna talk to you so you can process this because you need to understand what's the problem you need understand what's wrong and what I had to really realize is they didn't ask to be born into this yeah you know I mean like that it's not their fault right that they're coming up completely different than how we were raised right and we can't have anger or frustration that's dedicated and thrown towards them because they got it so much better than what we had how do we make sure to be passed down to proper lessons so that they appreciate and understand and not take for granted right they have right for me it's tough because good kids good students their plot themselves in school they listen they don't do dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah they want to play video games and stay up like any other kid there's no signs of a bad or crazy yeah and the fear and panic is that you got a note it bad and crazy exists right this fairy tale day we're in isn't real and at some point when I'm not around when your mother's not around when you have friends or other family on around you may get tested with the other side that's out here that you've never seen right so I gotta prepare you for the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that you don't know exists I gotta take you to Philadelphia so you can see I try to show my kids where I grew up thinking that's going be like oh my goodness backfired it's so cool can we live here shut up [\\xa0__\\xa0] you told my everybody here the car right now around you talk like this move your back this does not go well supposed to oh my gosh so cool dad is so different oh my goodness walked him around a neighborhood and it's like it's it's it's not a reality you didn't have grass and that's dad oh that's great would you play why were you here yeah when you hear these things it's so different man these were your steps the steps are broken how did you even play oh my god dad so wait we're weird was yours we lived on the top floor not the whole thing no it's this is three separate units so the top floor was me and grandmom's the middle that was somebody else that was a neighbor and downstairs or somebody else three different people lived in this one thing together y'all with strangers my own hands I don't know I don't know what's say it this part yeah right in the car but but when you see that that's the reality that you get hit with of I gotta make sure that I'm talking I gotta make sure that I'm constantly teaching yeah if I'm not and I'm not doing my part I'm failing you know took them to the neighborhood and showed them how stores are in the neighborhood it's what we got candy from here's here's what we would get little sandwiches from y'all walk we don't have no stores like this we can't walk this stuff it's a completely different world well it's a completely different world see people stand on the street corners what they doing they're big they selling drugs that's that's tough right there those are people that your dad still knows they've been there forever that's what you don't want to do but they're forced with these decisions just because of what they have to do you just need to see this dad is taking you here to see this drove them all around all around North Philadelphia all around South Philadelphia made sure they could see yeah physically see we go out the country we go to these resorts and islands before we go they're gonna drive around so you can see what exists before you get to this this is why we have to be good people this is why we treat everybody with respect this is why your dad likes to give everybody doesn't have I'm constantly beating my kids with that information because if you assume that everybody does you come off like such an [\\xa0__\\xa0] when you're around people that don't yeah like how did you you don't also the advantage that they had growing up the way they are now it's such a rare thing and they don't understand it there's no way there's a small percentage yeah a very small percentage and that's something that I never want to let go of either so I was in the back of my head are you talking about how you know are we gonna have enough food you were coming up Chris Rock's joke is so great that he used to tell the hi he keeps a bag packed at the front door cuz he don't believe that this [\\xa0__\\xa0] is his I truly believe you thin at any point somebody gonna go gotcha you thought you lived here did you visit joy and I was like it's so real because even though you have it you can't lose the sight a reality of where you once was yeah do you are you comfortable where you are now or do you still have those thoughts like this is this real because you you're at this stratosphere of Fame and success that's it's rare amongst the rare hmm you know it's like David Goggin says you are uncommon amongst uncommon men I will be a hundred percent honest and say I'm comfortable with the understanding of hard work brings great rewards this is a reminder of the hard work and dedication that I put into everything that I've done I'm not content because I know where I came from and I don't ever want to go back that doesn't mean I don't want to go back to the city that doesn't mean I'm gonna go back to the people that means I don't want to go back to living like I once was I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna help I want to inspire what a motivate I want to show people that there is a way out that there is a way to do more to get more to obtain more but I personally don't want to lose all that I've been able to get so I need to make sure that I do everything to keep it so I can't be content mmm so there is an understanding but I refuse to click on the switch of so even if you like even if you have more money than you'll ever spend for the rest of your life that's not what it's about it's about the inspiring people and the influence and constantly giving back and moving forward in a positive way and the only way you can do that is to stay active it's the story man yeah you know we're we're all writing a book what's your book look like mmm what is your [\\xa0__\\xa0] book look like like your life is a bulk you got a bunch of chapters in your book but when they closed that book how good was the book how good was your book what was the ending to your book if the ending to my book can be so amazing because of all that was done the money all that was accomplished the first to do the man that did this he caused a merger between this because of his commitment and growth to this the communities were then given this made education this changed the way the schooling was Baba Baba gave books gave computers gave all of the things that can be associated with you and your existence become a part of the chapters in your book so my drive is about my book I was a New York Times number-one bestseller people will be done they did it I'm writing another book you ready to vote right now yeah what's it happened what happens if you are to Tom New York Times number-one bestseller if you get the two what happens if you get the three hey man how do books become successful who publishes them I want to start a publishing company heartbeat publishing why not mmm that's the thing all I'm doing is sparking the awareness and others to go why might why can't I create why can't I start why can't I be a business why can't I be a CEO why can't I be a tech guru why can't I [\\xa0__\\xa0] create cooking products lotions since there's so much that some people just don't understand they can do let me be a spot to show how much how many different you don't have to do just one thing when it's all said and done my book is gonna be full of all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] that Kevin Hart did cuz I never was content with doing just one two or three why not Kevin why are you creating [\\xa0__\\xa0] health and wellness products why not I'm big on health and wellness why can't I why can't I try to create something that I filled is [\\xa0__\\xa0] great and jump into a space that I'm already in I already give a hundred percent of me in this space why not why can't I talk about financial wealth why can't I go back and educate those that don't know why not you got time I make time well you certainly can but it's just so unusual that someone dedicates that much energy and time to giving back and getting involved with the kind of projects that you're talking about as well as be super ambitious with your own career it makes me happy yeah I could tell I'm genuinely happy discovery makes me happy like when you find different things to be excited about it makes me happy and it's weird when it clicks and schooldays to tell you all the time information is key read these books there's so much knowledge [\\xa0__\\xa0] that book time to read that book I want to go home goddamn Sonic the Hedgehog I want to play I'm at level 3 I got something to read this book the information is stuff there it was forced down your throat at a certain age you just you just may not be receiving it correctly but then it clicks you may gain information differently and what you do with that information is up to you but people people have different roles they can go down the education wasn't my pick of choice it didn't do it for me but the knowledge in the common sense that I have naturally allowed me to gain information apply it differently it allowed me to grow smarts in so many different avenues to where I said oh my god I found my niche I found my talent and now there's other things that my talent can take me to I don't have the all the knowledge and awareness but I can allow myself people to do that can teach me because now guess what learning is cool ya know what happened you don't have to do it anymore right it's its own you're a kid they force you into this school you don't want to learn but then when you get out and you realize like oh this actually benefits me does it make me a better person this makes me wiser it's 100 percent dirty and it's weird how it happens but when you go oh my god learning and knowledge is power mmm [\\xa0__\\xa0] they used to tell me this when I was 10 my quads yes mom sons 10 11 years old I heard that [\\xa0__\\xa0] all the time now I finally get it damn I'm about to be 40 took me all this time to get the goddamn code but I got it yeah it hits you at a different time mm-hmm and when it does be excited about it man you excited I'm excited about what 50 years I'm just now getting to 40 do you read books I don't read a lot of books do you listen to books on tape I have listened to books you know what let's do what Tony Robbins he's great Tony's a like I like his approach to giving information mm-hmm I like his attitude in general I like podcasts I like things that are real and out of presented in front of me I like information that I can go to the source and and touch and talk so I'm I and I'm reading a book it's a book that was recommended by such-and-such and the person who gave it to me and that's reading that book I learn more about the individual that I thought I already knew and now I gain more Michelle Obama's book great book great [\\xa0__\\xa0] book I met her I talked to her I've been in the same rooms I've seen her success what is her book gonna be about mmm or read a book Wow I get it I get wise moving all the units that it's moving I get why women are reading his book and walking away feeling better feeling like they can't I get it oh wow hmm certain friends Dwyane Wade wrote a book focused on being a father his road to becoming a better father what he went through with his kids mother he developed a relationship than a bond with his sons like nobody else Wow didn't know that day that's dope I love how you put it on page there's certain things that you just want to know certain books help I understand why people read books I get what the information does you know the book that I'm working on now is all about the mental approach that you have with life and people not understanding that your biggest enemy is you my whole book is about you battling yourself people to understand is you against you the only person that gets in your way is you nobody else is you now when you write a book like this and especially about something like this this is like the way you've managed to navigate through life mm-hmm are do you do you write it out in essays do you do you do you have like bullet points that you you think about and then once you have those bullet points you had then you write on those how do you do it get on your phone it's all all voice notes and transcripts okay so because of your time you don't have you don't have the the time to sit and actually write mm-hmm so you need somebody that you can talk to for hours hours hours on it hey I need a hour but I gotta holler for me I got some stuff we want to talk to you about keV what what's that all right book title ideas subtitle ideas my dedication is my introductions within my introductions these are all powerful paragraphs and things that I was just said that are now transcript I get to go back and read it come see here there's no conversation at all every one of them um no conversation all and that's what the Internet has allowed people to do Internet has allowed people to skip steps 1 through 30 as a lot of people to jump straight to 100 [\\xa0__\\xa0] you good job off take them down you should be dead oh god [\\xa0__\\xa0] can't stand this whatever the hater the anger is when listen when listen ok when I listen and I can change I'm not that guy we're doing these weird things now that people aren't taking the time to sit and think through what I've understood is that what people are doing has nothing to do with me I should always be a step ahead because I'm thinking differently because I'm thinking about myself making myself better puts me in a position to make others better be the example not the problem the best way to take away the problem is to a lien 8 yourself from it these are business thoughts oh it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] thought I can go through and just read this is a so you just have these philosophies of your life and you just just speak it listen just speak it dance so now this is all chance capable Columbus's that's incredible there's all [\\xa0__\\xa0] transcript this is all Sarge's go back throughout the day and I read it and I say this is great this makes sense this didn't let me reword this I mean make sure that it's all flowing together and at the end of the day what's my reason for the book my reason for the book is make you better my reason for the book is to make people understand yeah we all agree we all should think that we're great there's no reason for you to not think that you're great if you don't think you're great ask yourself why why don't you think the highest of yourself when you do people have no no choice but to follow suit mmm you had no choice but to follow suit a lot of people they base it on their past they base it on the life that they've experienced up until this moment makes you better yeah it does make you back you better make you smarter yeah unless you say it yeah man that's what's interesting about it that's what's interesting about life you can hear a guy like you say that and then it changes your perspective and then you'll go out and take action that you might not have taken before I had a 585 on my SAT confessions I didn't take money confession they give you 404 put your name on a paper it's true story Wow I guessed a BAC a da I did abracadabra true story swear to God hand on my mother's grave a BAC a da I didn't care because there was a class trip that same day I wanted to go great adventure I was told they're not taking my SAT seriously but prohibit me from furthering myself in life that's what I was told at the moment I said damn maybe I should have maybe I should've applied myself maybe I should have been different when I saw my friends get their test scores back and they were ecstatic 800-900 960s everybody's going to college I felt like the biggest idiot in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] world the biggest idiot in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] world because the same people that I want to rush to go to great adventure with they had taken an SAT a week before they already got their work done mmm they did everything they were supposed to do so that moment of fun was real fun for them I was the only dumbass that didn't prioritize and take care of my [\\xa0__\\xa0] so I'm the only one going to Community College everybody's else off to Villanova Temple University Drexel University god damn I just got left behind why didn't y'all tell me that y'all did it the week before how come you only tell me that we was serious about the college [\\xa0__\\xa0] you ain't tell me I was trying to go to simple or Drexel all wait it's because my life isn't their life they're focused on themselves wow that they're doing what they're supposed to do hey jackass go sit by yourself and figure it out cuz that's where you should be lesson learn any opportunity given should be taking series from this point on because if not you can find yourself feeling just like this it's not I get down on myself a [\\xa0__\\xa0] moment I learn from it I learned from it now I got to take a goddamn test you best believe I'm studying for that [\\xa0__\\xa0] test cuz I don't want to feeling like I'm the guy mmm that didn't prepare now I got a story to tell my kids about what it feels like to be the kid in class that didn't prepare that's got the words great when they give all those grades back but it's because of my experience I don't look down on those moments you take those moments you make the best of them because their life lessons it's that simple you're saying it's positive but it's really just simplicity that's real real it's real and it's your life experience and it's your life's lessons 100% but the fact that a guy like you comes out and talks about it like that that's where it makes it really powerful because it's not just something that you learn from but now other people can learn from your past too that's what I'm hoping they'll look at themselves and they realize like we all start from a different spot you're not saying yeah this is why I'm so candid I'm so candid I'm so open they're there there is no like guys I'm fine with being an open book I'm fine with the good the bad ugly I'm fine being flawed I'm fine with all the things that have happened to me that have been exposed I'm fine with it all I don't hide from it I don't run from it I don't I don't avoid any of it I'm fine it's all right it's a bed that I made for myself I happily lay in it and I'll be fine figuring it out moving forward son don't stop for nobody man son don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] stop so I'm gonna be up in the morning regardless that son is gonna be up in the morning regardless of how I [\\xa0__\\xa0] feel

       "\"here we go in five four three two one yes and all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] people that make me feel lazy in this world is - okay make me feel you in the rock you [\\xa0__\\xa0] don't look like you ever sleep and I don't know no days off that's why I love is unattractive ass he's a he's a person that that motivates me inspires me in effect that we're we're coworkers were friends I think is I think it's like it's a blessing it's a blessing to be around that yeah because it truly it's it's uplifting you know it makes you it just makes you weed out the circle when you're around people that truly give you like give you some good serve a good value to you and your life you then look at those that don't and you can you can then push away so I'm big on I'm big on personality I'm big on energy I'm big on will and once I believe that is contagious so if you have a bunch of laziness and a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] around you naturally it's gonna feed off you're gonna find yourself becoming what's in your environment so I feel the exact same way and when I see I see that in you I see that in you I've seen avatar I see you I see you yeah but a guy like that like I always wonder like how much of that is look I've had sleep experts on the podcast to tell you like like there's real problems if you don't get enough sleep like you could you have a much higher risk of Alzheimer's well there's other serious issues but I see a guy like the rock I'm like how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] does he sleep what where's the room to for sleep you know that that's true I can't say that I'm that I've witnessed the sleep patterns but he's a he's a late ass so he does I know he's sleeping to some rest which is well-deserved but you know when you when you say you had these sleep experts and stuff on it's always a thing that I go back and forth about because what is enough sleep like I'm a person I function high off of six to seven hours yeah six seven hours I'm I'm functioning yeah five hours I'm great do I do the five hour thing all the time no but if I have to I'm fine I don't need the eight and the nine like that's too much for me like I'm I'm an early riser and now I'm getting older you know if I can get in that bed by 9:30 or 10:00 on an off workday I'm very happy with that but then I'm up at 5:30 I'm up at 5:00 so what is it enough sleep what do they tell you this really depends on the person there are people that have a gene where they can just sleep for hours at night I got gone oh my god I got that what is that gold what is that what does this means you got special gene goddamn right Amalia yeah that's um [\\xa0__\\xa0] there are there are people that just don't need as much they can they can go a long time without sleep diagnosed me I'm one of those people you thought you might be I bet a lot of high functioning people are cuz your body tends to you get more efficient you know like you you're always going you're burning hard so your body's like when it's time to shut down it's like shut down get that five six hours in alright do you do well I will confess this I am an amazing cat Napper yeah I'm one of those guys if you stop talking to me long enough i'ma fall asleep right here it's something about silence real and just not doing anything and I just well it's probably probably going on momentum all the time you probably you're probably going on motivation and momentum okay then when your body has this break you've already here's a little sleeper that's just right I'm dead serious that's I know for sure that that's accurate cuz I'm how catnapping heartbeat do you feel like you've hit a good balance so this is what I was wonder about guys like you or guys like the rock when I look at your Instagram your social media and you're just constantly going like god damn do you ever feel like you do too much like maybe I just need to take a little break here do you ever feel like that I think perception definitely perceives reality you know what looks like so much isn't always so much because you have a schedule and you know within that schedule there's the things that mean the most that come in act is downtime you know me in my house is downtime even though it's still active and I gotta be dead and I'm with the kids and a wife in this conversation and I'm running around and I'm back for that still exes downtime for me like I'm shutting a work off so the phone is any office I'm not going back to get it until the morning and it's all conversation it's all TV it's all Taco Tuesdays it's couch and cuddling you know baby time whatever that's my downtime because I'm taking a step outside of the other [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's wise that's that's what I think I do very well I can step outside the other [\\xa0__\\xa0] I can separate it so I think when you're able to do that then you're you're managing your mental you don't mean like if it's if it's always one thing all the time that's how you [\\xa0__\\xa0] drive yourself crazy cuz you never you're never shutting it off yeah and I think I do a good job of shutting shutting this off and focusing on this like when I want my family I'm with my family nothing is nothing interjects or comes in between that's fantastic that's so important it's understand that's beautiful I doubt that's gigantic I think I figured it out that's it you mean you've got so much success it's all you have to be with that [\\xa0__\\xa0] phone all the time that's that that's the phone is the big one right well phone the phone is is the gift and the curse mm-hmm you know I think that we we shout out the gate and saw the gift oh my god it's it's it's community is connecting us we're able to share we're able to meet new people we're able to stay in communication with with all people find new people as entertainer I can engage with my fans and this is so dope and then after that you get hit with the the curse and the curses there's a there's a high level of negativity that's out there that's on that [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know there's there's a lot of people that are you know not happy or going through things and they interject a certain amount of negativity and hatred through these devices these devices are the easiest way to touch everybody so when you're just consumed on that [\\xa0__\\xa0] all day you start to see yourself being a part of the negative [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah so what I've learned to do is go I don't I don't need to see that I don't need to see that [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't I don't pay that any mind I don't read that [\\xa0__\\xa0] for what it's not it's not helping me it's not making me better it's not it's not pushing me to new limits if anything is taken up just creative space by me literally spending time going and navigating through what I think is is a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know so I don't let the device beat me and at one point I definitely did at one point it was everything there was everything you know now I separate it I'm not embrace clear of it what when you realize what it is when you see when you see the bad you know when you see the bad side of it I thought the other day this is some real [\\xa0__\\xa0] and it really made me think my phone died my phone died and I'm driving and I was using the [\\xa0__\\xa0] maps and I said [\\xa0__\\xa0] what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] am I get to with I don't know where I'm going I said I was like you know how did we how did we get from point A to point B before the map [\\xa0__\\xa0] what were we doing that I used to print out directions from Google Maps I remember that but then before that how did you get to the places where you were going that you didn't know how to get to I don't even remember remember Thomas guys do you remember Thomas Scott I did have a Thomas guy when I first moved to LA I did have a Thomas guy and I know look a hundred percent bill burr had one two a three years ago but it really [\\xa0__\\xa0] me up because I was like how do we don't even know how how to do the common yeah the the the norm anymore because the device has made everything available and I literally had to to drive to store rocket buy a charger charge up my phone to get back and use the map to get to where the [\\xa0__\\xa0] I was going I had no idea how to get there I had no I didn't know no numbers by heart I didn't know who I was gonna call oh my god this is the moment where I was like what level of success have I reach I just pulled over and I said here and I was like how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] am I gonna get the widow's bear phone man I don't know what it were a backup phone it felt like the end of the world if it felt like it was over house like [\\xa0__\\xa0] and that crazy I dependent you are but that's when the light bulb started to click yeah it started to click like how how do we function without I want to go backwards a little bit yeah it's still there I still need it I still think it's dope with all of the things that we can do want it but I still want to be able to put it down and step away from it my kids to be able to step away from it that's why when I come in the house my phone is up cuz I can't I can't [\\xa0__\\xa0] and get playing it's all about being on your phone if you see me doing the same thing right right so that time those conversations me wanting to know about your day you talking to me about your day your friends who you like who don't you like my daughter you what boy who what no ok my son yeah I like somebody who oh jesus here it comes it's a great thing and I want to be able to have those moments and you know I think it's it's it's big to make sure that you prioritize that are you worried about what comes next hundred percent I'm worried that something's gonna be way more intrusive than that it'sit's what do you mean it's already happening yeah the biggest scare happened already with the the the FaceTime [\\xa0__\\xa0] that happened where whatever whoa Apple on the iPhones it was like people could listen in to your oh yeah if you didn't need to pick up the FaceTime you could just yeah and you know that was the scariest [\\xa0__\\xa0] ever because it's if it's that easy to have a bug like that what's the thing that's not a bug that's there that you just don't know about oh there's definitely government listen to us well hunter is it yeah 100 everything everybody says and then in case one day you do something wrong they go by your side mr. Hart we'd like you to sit down from NYU something hundred percent yeah so the fear is the next level of them are intrusive you know I think everything has become intrusive now like the toughest thing for me is that there is no there is no privacy outside my home right you know the the amount of money that you have to now spend just on security on you know people to to be with me security to be on my home you know it's like they're there literally is no privacy and it's not a bit you complain about it because without the fans without the people that support me I wouldn't be where I am but there's no middle ground right you know there is no handshakes anymore it's it's how you doing right right right yeah a handshake is so much better right I get a moment like I'm we can talk if that's what you no no yo say it now weird cuz you you're doing this to me it's kind of weird to have a conversation so you're just starting to see yourself become a little older and wiser and uh just really see the times for what they are and see the direction that we're going in this people and just hope and pray that we find a middle ground because I think right now that is it one yeah that's what I'm feeling now no I feel it too and I especially I mean what you're talking about is you being super famous and losing all your privacy but everyone's losing their privacy yes slowly but surely it's it's happening to you because you're very famous and because you do something that's in the public eye and people want to see you and they want to stick that camera in front of you but there's gonna come a point in time where what we're dealing with now which is like you have to turn your phone on you have to you know you have to reach out to somebody you have to put something up that's that steps gonna be out of the way who's gonna be people being able to act that's your life yeah pretty you know you know the bad here's what I said it's bad that really [\\xa0__\\xa0] with me I don't like that negativity is the the want you know like like the the thing that's popular is the failure the the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you know the the fight that I can catch you know the hateful moment that I can catch and post like the bad is being highlighted and celebrated that's what [\\xa0__\\xa0] with me what the social media [\\xa0__\\xa0] now what really bothers me is you know when you see these things online like you know a fight and there's a man hitting a woman and it's captured right that's bad the bad thing is that you watched that the the video was more important than the actual help right or the moment to step in and you know when you see these things where you're catching people do these things to kids and it's caught the moment of what you got and what you want to post and get likes or whatever on is the focus instead of the help yeah and that's that's the part that is just I just have a hard time processing I have a hard time processing what the likes mean to certain people well you get an extraordinary amount of attention so it doesn't mean anything to you anyway it means something to a regular person but you a regular person if they can catch some worldstar video and put it up they're like dude that's my video that's my video look my video got 5 million hits yeah my video has gone viral my videos everywhere for them it's like it's a point of excitement that's why when they see you look oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] how often are they gonna run into Kevin Hart at you know Costco or wherever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you were definitely running right it to me on uh you know I'm in a I'm in a bathroom restaurant and I go to the bathroom you know by the way that I went to the bathroom you could definitely tell I had to [\\xa0__\\xa0] I was I was moving fast I was he knows one of those abrupt you know why you eatin yeah I'm eating bad so I didn't eat bad in a while my stomach immediately said that's not gonna happen today I get up and I go and literally like like three seconds I hear it as I'm walking or they go keV hard and as I'm walking by a guy gets up follows me in the bathroom he's like yo I gotta get a picture man and I said let me let me go to the bathroom when I'm done I'll take a picture with you I go to the bathroom this is a true story hannah bible hand on the Bible I assume the guys outside the bathroom cuz I as I'm going I see him and I say what I say I get done I go to the snake wash my hand he was just sitting behind a wall and he's like got his phone out I'm like he probably did he just take me while I was [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude put the phone over the thing like I'm about to be on oh my god it's over this is it this is my nightmare here we go they're about to put something up of me shittin is the bottom of my feet it's whatever yeah but he just waited and in that moment was so it was so important that he was in the bathroom and soon as I got a call on the second I said let's go outside the bathroom yeah let's take a picture it's a bathroom I said might am I going to I'm a nice guy man I'm gonna take the picture cuz I just don't want to lose you and I'm like there's not even a thought it's not even a thought about it's a bad price how weird is that Sebastin minutes this is a this is a pretty [\\xa0__\\xa0] weird moment man this is weird Halloween you will be the finish [\\xa0__\\xa0] no no what you got on your phone right you're too big for me to ask to go through your phone or whatever you got you got but I had to go out and take the picture and I remember going back to the table just like what's happening that's not strange at this point what is happening yeah that didn't exist before I think if you were famous before people just wanted to get an autograph or shake your hand what Pat what passed an autograph stage was last time you get an autograph it's been a while I don't write it I was I think I would know what to put that it's been a minute man yeah and I don't want to make this very clear you know it's not I don't I don't know you know I understand like once again I want people to more importantly understand the fact that I welcome it yeah I welcome the moment that I can talk in and converse with the fame but it should be that like it's normal people the moments are better when they're real you know and after a real moment you you get a picture because you're like yo he was actually a nice guy or I know I did it that you would be this calm and cool you don't even get to see how genuine of a person I am because the first thing you do you you you stick the camera in the face you and that's when people think that you're an [\\xa0__\\xa0] because they they they they have the intrusive moment that then gets met with the can you keep please I'm sorry you're not the you look at my face you're gonna be like that they look for that now you get your moment yeah you you look for the negative moment when does it start getting weird for you but how many years in um I know it's been it's been pretty crazy I've been pretty crazy for like the last four to five the last four to five years and the last three you know if it's gotten insane because now you know you're you're on an international level its global and the following is is bigger and it's all ages which is which is really really good but I think you know for comedians it's a different thing because you feel like you know comedians you know you're laughing we're in your homes everything is met with warmth so when you see a comedian especially if you're a fan of a comedian you're associating everything with funny and you're just looking for the funny moment right you're you're looking past a normal moment you know it's like you you almost are frowned upon if you're normal if you just chill right right right because everybody wants the funny moment right they thought you were gonna be funny like I'm supposed to I suppose a pop lock right on the site you know yeah if it's 2:00 in the morning and you run into me and I say hey how you doing man that's not enough when work out your [\\xa0__\\xa0] now mm-hmm I've seen you at the Comedy Store but only once where do you work out your [\\xa0__\\xa0] I like to go to random comedy clubs you know I think I'll go to New York first New York has always been a home when it comes to building putting some structure within a set that you trying to figure out once I got a skeleton of what I want to do I'll just go to West Palm I love that comedy club The Improv down there and all the place is great I'll stay for two weeks Oh real and just go and run through some jokes I'll go to Utah I'll go to Denver who do two wise guys yeah yeah yeah I'll go to comedy clubs just random comedy clubs that you wouldn't expect to see me at but I'll do a hell of a run and the goal is to get out of there with just a foundation not to have a complete set I just want to get a foundation so when I'm done getting the foundation then I'll do a little comedy club run I'll do a full comedy club run where I'll just put two or three months in and it's comedy club comedy club comedy club and I'm doing seven shows a weekend and people are shocked that I'm there and then I'm doing it but you know that's my that's my gym that's how I work and I end up leaving that period of time with a complete set after the first three or four months that I spent now after that comedy club three or four months on that run then I take it to like a small theater I see what my laughter feels like in a small theater and I do a little run in small theaters and then when I finally feel like it's at a point where I'm getting the the laughs consistently and the punchlines are working and I flipped it back frontwards forward every direction and my story is a real roller coaster and it has an ending where I feel like we get off the roller coaster and we're happy and you don't feel like you were there for an hour mmm is then when I go test it out in every nough and if the arena if the last er sounds the way it's supposed to then I say okay I'm ready if it doesn't then I'll go back to small theaters and then I'll go to an arena again so not to that arena sounds the way it's supposed to do I say I'm going on tour so sometimes it takes me about a year a year and three months here in four months you know people don't say how hard it is to develop our of stand-up material people act like you just turn on a new hour it's it's an hour to get to an hour you're going through four to five hours of [\\xa0__\\xa0] that you thought was funny yeah to come up to that hour that you finally say this is gonna be the representation of me this year yeah it's a lot for me to do that especially at this level you know well especially while you're always doing movies and you're always busy with a bunch of other stuff to stuff yourself yeah you don't take any breaks white or I actually you know when I'm touring if there's a movie I make the movie schedule around the torso my shooting days will go Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday rap Thursday maybe ever show Thursday night and then I'm going Thursday Friday Saturday sometimes no show Sunday sometimes show Sunday depending on what the work schedule and the workload for the following week would look like so I'm implementing that in so when I say I'm out I'm out I'm gone yeah so I've knocked that movie out in two months and then when I'm not that tour schedule shifts so the Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday dedicated the family dedicated to an office everything then those weekends are torn but that's all last for a year and a half I mean this year we did 157 shows on my irresponsible tour Wow 157 show before you decided to put it on the Netflix special yeah we did the Netflix the taping I think I did it three weeks before we were done so we probably had 143 shows oh wow then I taped it and finish the tour did you always have this kind of structure like when did you how did you design this thought-out individual yeah I mean thought-out individual it's not random no everything is planned if you look at all my stand-up specials there's a two-year gap in between them so the two-year gap is because at the end of that second year my new special should be coming out when a new special should be coming out I'm now focusing on what the next special is going to be so that first year is all development like right now I'm off I'm not touring but now I'm mentally in the gym and throwing all the old stuff that I talked about a way that's now thrown out can't repeat it can't say it now it's talking about what the new version of myself is going to be what do I want the conversation to be and what's my thinking and just taking notes so eventually now I'm gonna start just popping up a random comedy clubs and trying to figure out what the next thing is so by mid mid 20 I'm probably doing comedy clubs by the end of 20 I have a full fledge concept of that new hour and by the beginning of 21 I should be ready to go out with my new hour hmm end of 21 film my new our mid 22 that hour will come out that seems like a schedule a lot of people are doing now the 2-year schedule it's a perfect get yeah that's hard dude I know louis c.k did a year every year and George Carlin did every year but I think even he said really wasn't the right way that's tough a year stuff yeah I mean that's a that's a shout-out to those that can't do it I think that's amazing [Music] I think just for everything that I have going on and all of the different things that my hands are in within the brand the business I need to make sure that I'm giving a hundred percent change those things so they have the highest opportunity to be successful right if I'm trying to cheat it then it's gonna show you know it's not gonna come out to the best of my ability and with that stand up you got a you got a [\\xa0__\\xa0] magnifying glass on you you know you're always being judged off of what you did at one point just like a musician you're always judged off of the album that everybody thought was whatever so the biggest thing for an entertainer artists whatever your craft is is creation how you recreating yourself how are you constantly showing that you're growing for me the only way to do that is to talk about my life and the things that grow along with me the only thing that grows along with me my experiences my family my marriage my mistakes my UPS my downs those are the things that I can talk about further because as you get older things change it gets different it's all coming from my personal opinion of me my view on me and how I see Life you can't lose material in that state mmm that's why I stay away from certain things because those things can become boring after a while for me because I don't have the knowledge of everything that I should like what well politics I don't know joke in the politics I don't I don't joke and anything that has to do with the slander of others or other communities I don't do anything divisive good for you that's my that's my biggest thing and you know this past year was was one that got a little weird because I was like you know I've really dedicated myself to breaking people together like I'm I know that was my my goal that's my priority I damn sure thought that's what I was doing on a global scale everybody all races shapes sizes whoever you are whatever you are you can come to a Kevin Hart show I have a good time so when it came off as if I was a person that was divisive that was tough you talking about the Oscar Oscar [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah this is a time where people are just looking to be upset about things a hundred they're they're not looking to looking at you Kevin Hart as just a human being like what who is he who overall super positive they're not even concentrating on that I mean think about how positive you are and yet they tried to concentrate on some jokes that you did what nine years ago it was a it's a it's a wake up call of understanding the times but it more importantly you know for me it was okay I went through it I made sure that the people of the LGBTQ community really understand it hey guys I apologized before but I'm apologizing again I'm sorry I'm not that guy I don't want you to think I'm that guy then it just became the constant conversation there never happened that it just became the constant conversation and and now it is guys I'm not only sorry I don't condone anything that has to do with hate to anybody this is no longer conversation so guys I'm gonna stop talking about it because now I feel like I'm feeding into yes what not I I know I'm not the world and public should understand and know them not because over this time period I've shown that I'm not so the apology once again I'm sorry genuinely I'm sorry but then it just kept it just it never stopped and at that point I just made a decision and I'm like guys at this point I just I'm making a decision to not talk about it anymore that doesn't mean that I'm being disrespectful to anybody that doesn't mean as I'm shutting down anything it means that for me I'm gonna stop talking about it because at this point I don't know what to do at this point I thought I thought the apology is what you wanted me to do I did it I made sure did you understand that I'm not a hateful person at Noga don't hate I did that I stepped down so I don't take attention off of that night knows people that are there to be celebrated I don't want to draw attention to myself and what's around me I step down everything I did was for the better of good I'm stepping away guys because I don't want this to be a negative night or a negative thing and then it still became a conversation so I waited for it to die down I went on my radio show gave another public apology make sure doesn't he understand it I'm sorry I hope these words didn't hurt anybody I once again apologized I don't condone hate to anyone I hope that you guys can forgive me for those jokes of oh so now I say if you don't understand it you don't believe it I don't know what else to give I don't know what else to do there's nothing else you can do that's very wise of you nothing it's very wise easy to step away like that because if you didn't they would probably pursue it forever but I mean it's it becomes a point of attention that's all it is it's decided that this is something they're gonna focus on what I had a I had a good talk and I'm gonna talk about this for a minute friend of mine Lee Daniels you know man Lee Daniels Lee called me told me where to talk to you know Lee Daniels is director producer the show empire's his biggest shows you know so he calls me he's like everyone talk to you and and I was talking he's like look this is a time where you could speak up and talk about you know the community that's been affected by hatred and you know hateful crimes you can step up and be a voice and say that you don't condone or don't stand with any type of hate or whatever you can take that stage and do that and I said Lee I said that's I understand what you're saying I said well why did you expect me to know what's been happening with in this community in regards to hate and crimes I said I I'm not aware I said some people can just not be aware I'm not even no I have no idea what's going on I have no idea yes within that community I have no idea right when you tell me this I'm now educated and I understand so it's easy to simply inform right information is key when people get information they process the information when you can process the information you go oh wait a minute that makes sense hey if you guys think that I can don't hate wait a minute I don't and anybody that does [\\xa0__\\xa0] you man that's bad you shouldn't I can say that but instead when this happened it was become an ally mmm become a voice you know and that's that's where there was just a miscommunication that's where a back and forth kind of was established that I think people just started to take things and run with it and I'm just not I'm just not one to feed into what I feel isn't going to eventually evolve into a positive thing in a real conversation yes yeah when I'm trying my best to it was becoming tabloid [\\xa0__\\xa0] as opposed to like a real discussion click me yeah click click me that's the problem there's so much bait out there because it's such an effective way to get people to pay attention to things because as you said people focus on failure and negative and anger that's what we want to see controversy that's what we want to see people don't want to see the anger yeah and and you know we think that is because it's just the times it's it's that's what's cool now always being negative you know how you always have some people it's a great example how you have people mean you can talk about a movie all right we can talk about Titanic wow it's authentic one of the biggest movies of all time [\\xa0__\\xa0] great movie yes it was great movie and why guy for no reason go I [\\xa0__\\xa0] hated it yeah why yeah like Titanic [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] why manga yeah I know what tell me why'd you hate it I got time talk about that the cool thing is just being different I wanna I wanna be completely opposite Denali Contreras how the people you know what no no that [\\xa0__\\xa0] was ass what Wow Wow why was it ass we have people that just like to do this oh yeah for sure and and and what happens when one person does it another person for no reason all go yeah me too yeah she was ask man i hain't like it either did you see it what y'all talkin about you don't even know what they're talking about but you just want to hop on the negative train right because that's what's cool it's not cool to be positive it's not cool to be happy I don't know if it's a cool thing I think it's usually people that are really frustrated with their lives 100% what's the that's the factual side to it I did a joke before was like do you think Michael Jordan leaves YouTube comments like people want to get mad and complain constantly about [\\xa0__\\xa0] like that do you know what it takes to do this right here you know right here no tell you how I feel write in your comments section Joe Rogan you can kiss my you know what that takes what do you have going that you have the time to just simply be that negative and do it in this world you know someone's just a mismanagement of your time yeah it is so valuable and I don't think people understand how valuable they can be if they use their time correctly yes now have you always been like this always be sausages oh my [\\xa0__\\xa0] god man but always always really I find a light in every dark tunnel I will find a goddamn light man I hear at all you listen when I tell you to wait on my back it's so heavy of all the stuff that I deal with and I'm fine the reason why I'm fine is because I'm genuinely happy I'm happy and I'm not happy just because of the success success X is a bonus I'm happy because I truly know the definition and the feeling that comes with happiness I truly know it I felt it I felt it when I said yo what really makes me happy and I look at heaven and Hendrix and I look his oh I look at my wife I go yo I didn't have the family [\\xa0__\\xa0] when I was coming up yeah I got one I got one look what I did look what I built these people depend on me I provide these people that makes me happy that makes me happy when my daughter comes up dad you're not only my dad you're my best friend no I'm happy that's my world so everything else from the outside that comes in your your your throwing [\\xa0__\\xa0] at a at a at a bubble that can't be popped mmm it's a force field around me yeah there's a force field around me because what matters what really matters loves me wholeheartedly and when you had that and you understand that you're unbreakable so if you don't add to that force field if you don't make my force field stronger you don't you don't you don't get time for me my team heartbeat productions the people underneath my umbrella you're part of my force field you what I believe we all see the same things we want the same things so we march with the same beat you can't you can't shake that when you're an individual that seen that and understands that if you've never felt that if you have no idea what that feels like then it's easy to shake you that's why some people are easily broken being broken is not a hard thing it's not a hard thing so those that do get broken those that do get down those that do get depressed I understand I understand I don't I don't knock people for it mmm I don't not anybody for it what I also understand is that the encouragement that can come from so many can add value for those that may need a little push hmm that may need a little Amen pick your chin up it's so easy to be that positive reinforcement for somebody and add value it's so easy but some people choose to throw that aside and kick while you're down mmm I try to put out the light of positivity because whoever is out there you I don't know what it could do for somebody else but somebody else may just simply look at me say you know the way to he embraces his kids it makes me want to be a better father yo way to this man doesn't stop and await it every day he wakes up and he's just positive regardless of what's going on makes me realize that this [\\xa0__\\xa0] ain't so bad the way that he gets up and says hey today is another day it's the morning let's all be better than we were yesterday somebody probably needed to hear that the more that I can give that out and I can take my platform to throw good energy out I'm doing my part because there's so many that thought the complete opposite yeah I don't want to be a part of that that's beautiful man that's and that's true I believe you it's not it's not forced right it's not phony yeah it's not fake this [\\xa0__\\xa0] every day I hear [\\xa0__\\xa0] every day it's very contagious too I had a lady I heard a lady right [Laughter] lady rolled out a window when you gonna make a good movie again did you see the upside was good what's that oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's a movie it's one of my movies that's how us think I think it's a good movie I see that all right ma'am you have a beautiful day that's with such conviction like literally yeah I could have said a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] like she rolled a window down you could tell she still had the crank things that I could say to you ma'am when you gonna make a good movie it's napping I got one out the upside you see the outside what's that oh it's a movie so it's out now amazing it that's how she chose to come out here I see it I'm Jesus to come at you with a negative I get it every day when you'll be funny again trying my best but trying my best if it's not working for you hopefully I do better soon what do you what what am I gonna feed into that and add water right why why for what yeah for what it seems to have been working thus far are you getting this positive attitude towards life from life experience are you getting it from books did someone teach you how to find this I'm getting it from the experiences and from the the real understanding of perfection doesn't exist don't exist Oh mmm we're in a time right now where people expect perfection you expect perfection I don't know where dust came from I don't know what happened that this is the criteria for living my true understanding is all right you got one life and then one life the goal for us is to live it to the best of our ability from the beginning so what said the end in the middle in the beginning middle you're gonna do things you're gonna make mistakes you're gonna [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you're supposed to learn and then move forward with the understanding of what not to do and when you move forward life may get better it may not but somewhere along the lines is gonna click and everything that I went through back here was supposed to happen so that now that I'm here I'm able to go ahead with such a high level of knowledge and I can make other people better I can make myself better I could do more for my family something happens my dad is the prime example crazy drug addict in and out of jail life was very bad very [\\xa0__\\xa0] bad my dad son got successful son then took money gave it to his dad here's your house here's your truck here's your monthly at this age I want you to live your life you know made mistakes you can't rebuild and correct the things you've done I'm your son I love you you can't go back in and redo you can't try to keep going backwards ain't about me you got grandkids mmm gonna be the best grand pop you could be for these grandkids that's your focus now where's this energy devoted to being a grand pop for the grandkids don't worry about me but something happened in your life something happened that took you in the direction to reap the benefits of your son's happiness and success my energy is now contagious nothing I hand it to you so now you're able to give that off to all these other people that you're around something happens and that's in every single life in every life I understand that there's a payoff for bad eventually there's a payoff it can't be bad but for so long if you got the strength and the understanding to realize that [\\xa0__\\xa0] will change it will change it's impossible just like poker I don't know if you play poker or not I don't you play poker you can run bad forever but it will eventually turn around once you grasp the understanding of the game eventually it's gonna turn around blackjack you're never gonna be the casino but eventually you're gonna have a good run if you catch you run you'll do good get the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of there you waited long enough for it to happen here come catch it leave anything in life will eventually turn good no but this is coming just from your own personal experience have any role models that I'm up to you this way Nancy art did she speak to you like this about positivity and about my mom reinforced knowledge my mom reinforced you don't start things and not finish them you don't quit there's nothing that comes out of quitting besides knowing that you didn't finish we finish everything you started finish it if you're gonna do it do it to try and be the best not be better than other people be the best for you if you're in school and you're going to class I'm not asking you to get straight A's I'm asking you to get the best grade that you can possibly get give me a hundred percent all the time and I'm a happy mother when you half-ass me I'm on yes mom I want to do this I wanna I want to play baseball well then you gonna play my mom like that no more then why'd you start the season because I thought I wanted to do it then you gonna finish the season you don't quit there's other people that invested time and energy into you you don't just quit on people but I don't want to do it finish the season mom I want to swim then you gonna finish swim it didn't matter what I did I was never allowed to quit so now in anything I do when I pick it up a say i'ma start it I got to finish it it all don't work it all ate the best hmm it all ain't knocked out the park but I walk away saying I finished it I did it I did it right now I've been boxing I saw I saw you working out with Rico Verhoeven I'm [\\xa0__\\xa0] first of all very strong kicker huge man okay he's a big guy too man good guy but I started in jeans I started it and I said why am I doing this I'm not gonna be a professional fighter I'm not trying to be a amateur fighter I'm doing the guiness shape alright then I start getting shaped I said you know so much that I don't know about the sport I at least want to make sure that I'm paying homage to the people that do this for a living by really understanding and learning it you know what I'm gonna get a real trainer I'm getting some real people to show me everything so when it's all said and done and I look back after my training I can go I gave it 100% and look at how good I got look at what I'm a product of a spar I go getting really yeah yeah just to feel it so I can say it you know well sparse Bryan Callen is this serious no it's me yeah that's me come on that's me dude that's me it's getting it to look at this who is teaching him uh his name is Biggs he's in Atlanta that's me learn I had a turtle shell within punches but you know he's a former Golden Glove guy really good to you were in a cup and everything when I was at the sparring session when I'm I grow tired damn yeah I got touched I got my ass whipped and every couple times I go guys worried about that all good I don't go crazy we had gear and but I'm not in there with guys that are trying to hurt yes I'm not in there was touching guys that have no concept of reality yeah or control like they're they're just helping me understand right here's why you have to keep yeah that is a problem with celebrities trying to spar like if you try to like you know that's why Mickey Rourke started getting all that facial surgery I'm serious he's part of James Toney Jesus lashes she's not a smart right here that's James Tony's a mean man and it's just not you can't like I don't I don't go in that space have you ever seen James Tony talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] boys bars and there's some of the most entertaining thing you'll ever find on YouTube he's just he just won't shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up beating your ass he's talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's her and he's one of the best defensive fighters ever so he's really difficult to hit he's got that smells fresh and a in the world yeah I had a guy who's got any Mikey I'm sparring with Mikey Mikey hit me with three punches I thought I thought Mikey literally had like six arms this is the true story this I said I don't know what just happened but I thought I had my hands up in no matter where I put him he just tapped me he lets me feel it but not to where I might getting knocked out but I understand now movement I understand pivots I understand shoulder protection and that's my goal my goal is just understand cuz I can't do anything halfway okay if you try to fight somebody nope right nope I just want to say that I did it and I learn and I can move and I look the part cuz I put time into it well as you learn it too as you watch and you start get trained then you start to look at a guy like Terence Crawford or lumen Co and you go oh now I appreciate what you're doing because before you'd see like oh yeah I beat that guy up oh yeah he knocked that guy out but then you see like how he ducks under the left and fires back with the right you know Jesus this is precision it's insane yeah the the respect that I have for people that do that on a day to day is through the roof yeah and people that fight are in the most amazing shape in the universe yeah you're in the most amazing shape ever to move get hit for three to five minutes around come back do it come back do it and these fights go on and on and on I take my hat off to you yeah you get three rounds out of me I'm breathing out my butt I don't know where the air is coming from I'm searching for it it's a crazy way to make a living to money in your brain thank God I don't I didn't have to go down that route and you know to those that do just make sure you just put your body first like you said it's a it's hurtful when you see the damage that it can call us yeah we were talking about that earlier like seeing guys as they start to deteriorate and it's hard because nobody wants to tell him that either every I want to tell them they got one more good fighting them and let's uh maybe at the end of the year then we'll decide but right now we're gonna train hard and my stuff it's hard to cuz there's no option so they don't once you've established yourself as a professional fighter and you don't have an exit strategy you don't know what to do you know now at least thankfully because of the internet guys are getting podcasts and they're starting doing commentary shows they're talking about fighting and it's the positive you just found the positive that's the positive within the internet that is positive you just don't you just don't hear it celebrate it as much well the Internet's very positive for me I mean this is the show we do on the Internet I mean all not just podcast but YouTube videos and also information I know more because of the internet than I ever would have without it there's not a not doubt in my mind a more educated more aware person I want just the Internet yeah you get the things that you're able to find and search and I mean like you said you're you're able to self-educate yeah at a very high level these are the goods yeah we're talking about the goods so when you talk about positive Kevin how have you been yeah are you always like that it's this it's the things that I look at that are so easy you're not just positive though you're look crazy ambitious that's the thing that gets me about you in the rock for sure it's like the ambitions off the charts like I know your riches [\\xa0__\\xa0] like when when do you think you got enough you don't have enough there's no doesn't know enough I don't have enough because it's not over it's all over it's not over so you know when when you put a cap on it you're putting a punctuation to it mm-hmm and the the the ambition comes from seeing what's out there that can be obtained you know when you see what's out there like what can you mean physical things like well you see what's out there when you see where people are really gaining wealth and knowledge from okay the business relationships that you're able to acquire the people that you're able to partner with and create certain things different revenue streams what I found is as a young black guy from North Philadelphia the biggest problem with the biggest problem within our community is knowledge we don't know debt debt is welcomed because it's celebrated that's all we know and I'm get that credit card oh my [\\xa0__\\xa0] that credit card up and it is what it is they gotta figure that out I ain't got it after that yeah well you know what I'm getting student loans they gave it to me then after that [\\xa0__\\xa0] is I'm figured out I put a cable bill in your name you put it in my name we can switch it up whatever they do it there let's just put it in someone else name its welcome the Hustle is welcome the knowledge of banks and what you can do it can't do is it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] you don't even get it cuz you go to check cashing places reason like go check cash place because I don't want go through that ship the banks I'll trust that go right there to check heads please let me get mine let me get mine now take $30 whatever let me get it the knowledge is given so it's not to you obtain that knowledge and understanding that you go oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh this is why you put money up oh this is this is how you increase versus decrease oh this is how you earn on your money oh wow I can gain wealth by investing in what the stock world is what how many people partake in a stock world and is there a part that isn't necessarily gambling is there a low-risk part these that's not the information isn't there so it's not so I got to a certain level and a certain group of people where I got it and now that I got it I want to give it so now I'm going to give it I'm gonna give it to the people that I know need it most and for me that younger generation of black people that don't understand the cool thing is in financial longevity not in a now it's not in the moment for jewelry not in the moment for the car it's in the longevity it's in building so at the end of the day you can say look at what I have look at what I worked for look at what I have that's mine monopoly is real but you have to have the financial understanding and I teamed up I got chased I never done something called financial fitness where's just about me educating people on money how to manage money how to how to be smart with your money but it's coming from a person that [\\xa0__\\xa0] that money I didn't always understand it I hold in taxes before because I didn't understand it in the beginning I've had bad credit credit cards wouldn't take me because I maxed out whatever I've been there I've done it thank God I was able to fix it and get on the right path and now that I have the knowledge I want to give it could simply don't know so when you say the end game the end game is getting to a point where I've taken all the knowledge that I've been able to get over these years and really applying it and providing family wealth when it's all said and done the last-named heart is gonna mean just more a lot more than just Kevin Hart and comedy heart beat production it's got heartbeat digital your heartbeat ventures your heartbeat real estate there's so many things that the last-named heart will be attached to you real estate Kevin Hardin sell real estate a Bible stand by it but the reason why is because investment investment but but as you get older you learn this you learn it and and you know it's such a thing where you talk about black versus white you know a lot of people do that and and I flee so like there is racism racism exists I'm not unaware of that but there is a high volume of it that's that's non-existent people had a good people and when you can merge yourself with good people and follow the paths that you see that these good successful people have taken you then become a part of a world and group that nobody expected you to be it so for me I now have the position to do that and take all of these relationships and all this knowledge and take it back to the people that need it most I like to share I don't want it all by myself now are you doing this and the financial stuff you're doing this in videos you like releasing videos no we're gonna start we're gonna start financial fitness like I said with chase JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon very good guy to Shanda is well they're there helped leading in charge of saying how can we get to the people that we feel need the financial information of most so I said put me out there like let's let's go directly to the consumer so from colleges from high schools senior classes junior classes going out and talking to people before they go into the next stages of their life a lot of things that you should know so you're gonna speak to them and just share personal information are you gonna put this stuff online as well yeah yeah you'll be able to track and find content from it but I'm authentic so I said the best way to really do it is to put me in a position to be heard right I want to be heard like like it's a different story what I explained to the the people of JPMorgan Chase just when we were talking about this and as an amazing board of people that are just figuring this out and the best way to go and do it and I said you can't have the white guy that's never been to the hood or who's not from the hood or has no idea how the economy works here and what the real troubles are you can't throw that man in the situation to talk to people because I'm not listening to you from the gate because you don't relate I don't relate to you but throwing somebody in a situation that's lived it that's been in it that's been [\\xa0__\\xa0] up in it made it out of it and is now coming back to help run it's a different ballgame and that's what I want to be and you know we have other voices outside of myself very powerful voices that are going to do it as well but the purpose is to align ourselves to really make a change so you can either be the conversation about making change you can be actual a part of the action to do it I want to be a part of the action and in doing it you'll also be able to understand my drive you'll get why I do so much you'll get why my hand is in so much because I have access to it and the question should be why not yeah the question shouldn't be yo why is he doing everything he should be why aren't you why aren't you trying to do everything why not well that's the thing about a guy like you that becomes contagious like what you were saying about surrounding yourself with positive people and people that are constantly ambitious and that that there's fuel to that you feel good about that that's what you're doing I can I can say seeing you here right we walked around you show me a facility loved it beautiful facility you talk to me about how your podcast is grown to where you are now the success behind it I don't leave here and go yo that's dope of [\\xa0__\\xa0] I go hey I need to do more work on my radio station laugh out loud radio I own it it's mine I got a show on there but you know a Joe [\\xa0__\\xa0] motivated me to do more I want to make sure that we understand really what's out here within his radio world because I just saw my guy in his space and I saw happy he is what success he has I don't want to be you or beat you I want to take this energy and apply it to myself that's the purpose of seeing yeah that's the purpose of being smart with your eyeballs you should be a sponge so I'm a sponge so I come here and I look at how you maneuver I look at your setup I not only bow down and congratulate you I leave and I said yo man I'm inspired dude that's dope as hell John can't wait in two years you gonna call me you gonna see my [\\xa0__\\xa0] you remember I said I was inspired but you're gonna see what I let it grow into that's the proper way to get encouraged in motivating right as opposed to being a hater a hater and in competitive yeah i'ma beat you it's not a competition yeah I'm not interested in that either and I share the exact same feelings it's not a competition at all yeah so if you don't have people like that that are inspiring around you you might not know how positive it is and how it how powerful it is if you see someone that's on television or on social media and you see them it's hard to be inspired you don't know them but you're I can say look at your circle right and in your circle if the conversation is all about what we hate I can't stay in that song you see the new [\\xa0__\\xa0] car came out okay this [\\xa0__\\xa0] is ass I can't stand that [\\xa0__\\xa0] car yo man I can't stay in this city what [\\xa0__\\xa0] we even in the city what we eatin I hate that place it's so easy if you people don't even listen to it it's so easy to be the smallest [\\xa0__\\xa0] in the world the smaller [\\xa0__\\xa0] but if it's always hate can't stand these [\\xa0__\\xa0] headphones why we got these headphones ladies like a horrible day why the buzz here [\\xa0__\\xa0] that Stan it's hard whatever hate harwood how could you get a private table [\\xa0__\\xa0] hate this [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] chairs you're got better chairs I hate these chips it's so easy right so easy it's so easy to talk about yeah yeah and so many people don't realize that in a group you do it you ping-pong hate off on them yeah unless it's funny it can be funny just between yourselves trees yeah Patrice was it was one of the best funny one of the best 20 haters okay okay you bring up a good point comedic hate McConaughey yeah communicate one of the not one of the probably the best Patrice Patrice I remember when I would talk and if I was saying something you just hear what would you tell buddies what what are you talking about you like just the way you talk but what your voice everything about your voice just makes me want to punch you in the face we talking about when he would go after you - it kind of made you feel good - like if you're a comments especially if your comic like I called Opie and Anthony once I was talking them and Anthony anything he always has a gun on him Harry's a gun everywhere like he has a concealed carry permit and [\\xa0__\\xa0] and I said to him I said do you ever worry that maybe you're putting out this energy and you're manifesting something like some sort of an attack on you because you're constantly dwelling on it you always have this gun and Patrice goes don't believe in magic don't believe me conjuring up the world he would go after you man it's like you just want to step back and watch I don't know but he got bill burr so Marilyn Oh bill used to get so [\\xa0__\\xa0] mad beautiful thing about Bill Barbara would be snap at bill bill is the guy that's not funny where's the punch line in it there's no punch line he was so [\\xa0__\\xa0] mad we the Comedy Cellar the days that we had there man bill burr Patrice O'Neal Keith Robinson Jim Norton Colin Quinn myself when I say we would sit at this table we would set this table for four to five hours and it would be nothing but beautiful trash ins to one another when I say they used to give me so much [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's probably why it's so hard to bother me now the trash ins that I took from the age 20 to 24 and my young comedic career about how awful I was I had a joke I had a joke where to begin into my career cuz at the times let me preface this this was way in the beginning of my career this was a joke that I had about about little people midgets at the time and it's you know it was so bad cause I got robbed by a cross-eyed Mitch and the joke was I didn't know he was robbing me because I was with somebody else so he was looking at my friend but he was robbing me it was like a play on being crisis very very awful joke I remember telling his joke in a phone book comes flying on the stage put trees through a [\\xa0__\\xa0] phone book at me I told him this isn't where the Boston comedy club people in a crowd tiny little place all you heard was and you sit back it hits the floor I said and Patrice said read it it's better material in it than what you're saying that crawls does laughs oh he's uh they all might say they used to trash me so bad so bad man do you alleged a retreat some news story a corporate trees jerking off at my house before this is I moved to LA I'm saying the two double partment I just got there Patrice coming out I said yo you need place ass I got two bedrooms you can come near it's my ex-wife at the time you know I come home it's like afternoon like Patrice mi yo you all but tres but race I go out in the bag open up the door I said his big-ass computer oh I see is his back hunched over so baby oil right and I come in on my door he'll get out get out get out [Laughter] he's so sick he's so sick that he didn't stop he was so concerned with finishing then he didn't even break stride and turn around and not really nothing he get out yeah you just saw his back hunched he came out like seven minutes late it was like my bad i may use come home [\\xa0__\\xa0] for treatment I love him to death love him to death yeah he had the most don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] of any time I ever met it was most 100% yeah good and bad yeah you know there yeah there was a good to it and there was also some bad you know a lot of things that didn't have been for Patrese probably could have happened but I think the the level of not give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah prevented some of those things well he was almost too authentic yes like his like gypsy that was it Charlie Sheen's roast whose roast was it that he did what he just torture everybody else on the roast and then he got up there and you guys the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is this [\\xa0__\\xa0] who is this [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh my god Patrice has so many of those things yeah so many of things one of one of the best to do it if you if you are listening you're not educated I'm Patrice O'Neal just I ask did you just watch Elvin in the room one of his specials yeah some of that some of the funniest [\\xa0__\\xa0] ever man and so insightful mmm-hmm he was so why the way people thought and behaved he would say [\\xa0__\\xa0] like one of the things that he said that I I tell people all the time it's a it's a brilliant thing that he said it was forget what controversy it was but he was on television with some woman who was saying that you should never tell jokes about certain things you know and they were they were getting mad at someone I think it was Opie and Anthony about a joke and he said you gotta understand that all jokes come from the same place the ones you like and the ones you don't like the ones that make you laugh and the ones that make you mad they all come from the same place someone's just trying to be funny yeah like sometimes they just don't work I had a talk I had a talk with the I forgot her name I got I forgot her name but it was when I was doing all the promo for upside and they kept trying to break down you know where where where the jokes come from you know Kevin these insensitive jokes in that you told back then why what what makes you why would you even say those things and the hardest thing for me to explain I was like do you think people think of jokes and while thinking of them think that they're not going to be funny everything that you think of in a joke form you're thinking of it because you think you're gonna get a laugh behind it yeah the gamble is if I get the lab versus not get the lab don't get the laughs the joke was not funny if I get a laugh then I guess I'm on to something there isn't a bunch of thought that goes into the funny moments that we think may be great bits yeah I wish that I had a more logical answer to put behind it I said I don't especially at that time my career I just thought it would be funny the same way that some people think sir jokes funny the offer it's a thought comedians are constantly throwing [\\xa0__\\xa0] out there yeah you're constantly rolling a dice and Thor [\\xa0__\\xa0] out there had to [\\xa0__\\xa0] you roll and good right it's not gonna be good the other hatten maybe all right maybe kind of good but it's all with the intent of entertaining it's not with the intent of being malicious it's not with the intent of sparking hatred it's all trying to make you laugh yeah that's it like it's it's literally that simple from a thought within the comedian's mind yeah nothing nothing else they kept trying to look for this like hard definition of why and it's like I don't have it I don't have the reason why I thought it would be funny and it wasn't that's the downfall that's it that's it it's it's and the thing is about this art form is that up until ten fifteen years ago there was never any discussion like this it wasn't so so when we developed and when we were coming up there was no it was just like and there was always guys that would push the envelope way too far I believe Jesus Christ you see his new bid what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah and you'd be laughing yeah you tell it to each other and yeah and it didn't matter what it was joke about murder or rape or what some people just use those dark subjects like they're trying to make us laugh yeah in the meetings the comedian's comedian there's always gonna be though well you just innovate you all do you know Brian Holtzman 100% yeah but in Holtzman's that guy 100% my funniest dudes and and and there's no way that I could say no some of the stuff that I heard me say remember Susan Smith that lady who drowned her kids I I know I know who you're talking about her and I know the moment but I'm not familiar with all all that involved Holtzman was on stage that week and he's like I heard those kids were bad I heard they set that close to the TV they never put away their blocks there we spilt their milk those kids will not be missed yeah and you were just like oh I in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] like 9/11 when 9/11 happened they wouldn't let him on stage well Mitzi shore would not let him on stage four months after 9/11 she's like no way keep him off the stage I mean do you have you have the people just Sartre did they go for that they go for because they want to hear you howl and get back to the room do you know that like if it's you know comics are there in the back of the room they're gonna laugh their [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass off at that chair and and you know it's weird because right now within a times I'm the comedian that chooses to be sensitive to the times you know I've made the choice to say I understand I get why you shouldn't say certain things why you should avoid this that or this I I understand and I am but then there's other comedians that go you know what I'm more staged I'm gonna be me and I'm not gonna do that because people are telling me that this is what I I'm gonna go harder yeah and do that that's yeah that just exists it just exists but I think it's easier to just say I'm not a fan that comedy isn't for me right you know what I don't I don't like the taste of this particular comedian so I'm not going to support a watch that comedian I'm gonna find another comedian there's more to my liking I'm going to go and just turn my head like I want us to get back to just understanding that you just don't have to support it yeah that's it well there's a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] option it's very I mean there's so many today yeah there's never been more never been more comics I think about how many people were doing Netflix specials so many's never been more it's something so easy so I don't understand why there's a push to destroy which you just don't have to support it like I think it's just a bunch of people that have an ability to influence things now that didn't have an ability before and it's like they see a window and they want to throw a rock it's right there makes sense I think there's something that but I also think mm-hmm for us like meat for me in particular I really like [\\xa0__\\xa0] up comedy it's one of my fits like I like Quentin Tarantino movies where people get shot and killed yeah I don't want anybody get shot and killed in real life yeah but I like [\\xa0__\\xa0] up comedy yeah do you know Tim Dylan is yes I do pull up that [\\xa0__\\xa0] video that him being mega Kane he is a savage dude he goes so hard but I saw this video I was tears rolling down my eyes I was crying and I was like okay this guy's needed we need this right now because during this political correct push you got this big giant gay dude who doesn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] let me seize an animal watch this [\\xa0__\\xa0] and we're going to it will be raised in captivity it'll be raised privately to be the greatest politician that has ever had my name is Megan McCain and I'm on a new show we have you see this to folks that [\\xa0__\\xa0] riverboat casino catherine is talking about my father again my father was tortured for a hundred years for this [\\xa0__\\xa0] country and he came back and he started seven wars because he's a gentleman [\\xa0__\\xa0] you try I'm gonna wear my father's skin mask and I'm gonna primary from the right if you don't know he's wearing lipstick and a dress oh my goodness that's pretty damn that's out there they need that guy we need him it's out there we need guys like that I mean just talking about what we said it's like it's just it's very easy to just to just say you know what that's not me behind what is like for me yes advice humor is different I laugh I laugh there's a rhythm there's a viral video it is this old guy trying to hoverboard he's like [\\xa0__\\xa0] he's gotta be like 69 70 and you know his grandkids there and he's like let me let me try it let me try it and this man gets on this hover board and takes if you saw Mike Tyson fall on a hoverboard his fall was worse than Mike Tyson's I've never seen somebody hit their head harder in my life and I didn't laugh out of wanting to see this old man hurt herself I laughed because it was stupid to try to get on his hoverboard in the first place and when he got up he tells the kids why is it moving like this this video everybody because that [\\xa0__\\xa0] made me laugh some people were watching oh no no some people were watching to go oh oh oh another one just died [\\xa0__\\xa0] laughing because everybody's humor is different yeah humor is different my humor is different falling makes me laugh okay we're you are falling makes me laugh I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] who you are if you fall in front of me no shot I'm holding there laughs there's no shot you don't stand a chance if you there's no shot that I'm not bust your ass something something's got to come out right falling is funny I still think it's hacky I still think farts are funny when my kids fart I laugh I still to this day it's the funny [\\xa0__\\xa0] every me that goes that V you stick get out of it stay gas my little son 17 months when you fart I laugh something something within just ability to just be [\\xa0__\\xa0] silly and GOP oh yeah it doesn't always have to have a meaning behind it some [\\xa0__\\xa0] is just stupid my eight-year-old farts on cue she thinks it's hilarious genius she'll tell you that listen I gotta talk to you about something that's laughing she think it's hilarious she'll fall down the couch she can't stop laughing that's all you got it's your only bit as a kid nothing else but farts that's all you got that's all you've got to make people laugh you should enjoy it no he should think it's funny folly but falling is number one for me falling is number one my wife fell down the steps she got so mad cuz I didn't rush to help her I laugh she had a wine glass wine with all over the walls oh my god what are the worst Falls I've ever seen in my damn lap got up her shoe was on one step the shoe was all follow us funny I like it I don't laugh have fallen that much I just deal with too many injuries I've seen too many people get hurt it's not for you yeah especially old dudes fallen down hitting their head on Mike I start thinking about brain trauma and CTE long-term repercussions I'm near I'm right there with you it's probably better I'm right there with you there's the one that's going on today of this dude trying to come up the stairs on this other dude did you see that one the guy stomped them and set him flying like all I could think of is we don't see it in the video but that guy's head it's got to be smithereens oh my god he he had hit his head the way he fell back yeah you ever seen one of the guy who slipped and fell down a bunch of steps at the museum and falls in the water yeah he's going it goes in water Dumbo right you can't you can't beat that there's this dude this goes walking up the stairs and this dude's legs get the [\\xa0__\\xa0] off my porch stop leave me alone and he keeps coming he's like don't do it don't do it and he got boom smack the way he fell back you know hands behind him that's all head that's all head first of all to not see that kick coming yeah from a guy that says it's sad but you also have to realize a guy that size is carrying all that weight of a donkey kick yes that's just caved in my got stomped but to not see it once again I always thought that about fat people but if you really really fat imagine how strong your [\\xa0__\\xa0] legs must be strongly should ever yeah if you really get some power behind that kick and also if you've lost the weight you'd have these incredible legs that's a that's always a theory just it's Anthony but I was wonder if their needs are gonna shrink it wait what because you see someone from behind they're like 500 pounds like their knees are that wide I'm like okay is that the bone like is that fat around the bone like has the bone grown really wide too cuz your body does your bones do get denser if you do like heavy weight mmm like this if you look at like power lifter dudes they're do they're dense well part of it is not just their frame it's that they're constantly lifting heavy things so your body thickens up did you as you go but you know when when you know people that are larger make the the dedication to actually losing the weight and they stay away from like the weights and stuff and just do cardio it sheds off so fast yeah but he can't like I know I know a couple of friends of mine and lost like 130 140 pounds and like if now just fallen in love with fitness to the point where it's unbelievable like how their body is transformed and taking a liking to the new the new process that they're now in pretty yeah they get addicted instead of food they get addicted to being healthy exactly it's totally possible totally possible I've had I don't know how many people come up to me and said they've lost a hundred pounds plus because of listening to my show and having fitness experts on and diet experts and and just talking about staying the [\\xa0__\\xa0] away from sugar say don't eat late at night yes that's eating stop eating in a certain time and give yourself more than enough time to digest Cal your calories start exercising well with me I think the thing with me that helps me so much as I'm not a foodie you're not I'm not a foodie man I'm just not you know it's boring gotta go eat with I'm just making a Turk that's it I'm literally just what is that yeah that's fine let me give that this baked chicken some brown rice that's fine I'm good you don't worry about eating healthy I'm a healthy eater because I'm not a foodie so it's not like it doesn't doesn't matter like I don't have the will or want to eat the bad [\\xa0__\\xa0] so if you're passing by in-n-out burger nothing no nothing nah man I'm black fried chicken fried chicken you showed me a process Popeyes Roscoe's is good too but Popeyes really pops

multivitamins which inspired me to start doing my home like right now we got bicycle okay I'm starting my own supplement line vitae hustle love to vitamin that we put out but let me tell you why doe I'm gonna tell you why I'm even getting into this space so when I look at physical fitness and I look at this world I noticed that you know you have a you have a great one in need to look like everything around you that you see like everybody like everybody that's a part of this world they look so [\\xa0__\\xa0] great and fit when they're talking about these products and the things they can do and I said you know what what I'm able to do and what I've done in my past I'm always bringing people together of all like in whole like there is nobody's alienated you know when I did my runs with Nike and before I got signed by Nike it was about bringing a bunch of people that never ran before and getting you guys to get up just come run with me just try it and you notice I got people out that never thought they were [\\xa0__\\xa0] do it and we doing five miles we don't ten miles whatever it's just a group run something to say we did I said how can I create a product where I'm putting people in a position to understand there's a hustle in all of us that's what my multivitamin is about it's the energy is the recharge it's the ability to focus is to approach your day with all of the tools that you basically need it's not just about the physical fitness aspect it's about the health so if I can actually motivate people to take the step in the right direction of health with a line of supplements that are driven for the everyday individual that may not know or be aware but wants to engage but you're not in it to look like all these different people you're in it to be the best version of yourself how can I do that teamed up with a great group of people to create the best possible products that I want to do and I said I want to be patient so it took me for you four years to create about us and how many different products you go right now just by dose vitae Hustle is my only one right now so it's just a vitamin just a multivitamin but it's an amazing multivitamin is it a single pill or is it a packet but no it's a it's a jar I should have [\\xa0__\\xa0] bought one good job a jar Jesus Christ so you like mix it in some stuff no it's a jar full like all pills yes pills okay um I'm gonna tell you the dope stuff this that's in it cuz I don't want to not say anything in and have it to where it's wrong so I always got it up on the screen man good Jesus Christ I get it hey you guys see it yep that's why you here we're gonna save that on my phone blueberry fruit extract scroll scroll back up there boron biotin beta-carotene vitamin A mmm-hmm what's all good [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's all good [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's more than a multivitamin I'll plan him in a it's good II what does that stuff Toco Toco trend all teletran out talk--i channels vitamin E family mm-hmm-hmm you ever heard of that Jim vitamin K look it up alright look it up it's a good thing too is that everything that's in it you know it's not only is it researchable but you'll see why like my biggest thing like as a guy that's not as familiar with the space I said who are the people that are they do it at a high level that I can incorporate into helping me build this product so I feel like you're never gonna do it by yourself you shouldn't try to do by yourself and you don't cut corners you don't go to cheap route you don't you don't do it wrong something you have to go back to do it again Brian so I went and I looked at the people that were involved with creating the quote-unquote best markets the best things on the market and I put that team together I put up a team like four to five I'm gonna tell you for years spent a lot of money developing this [\\xa0__\\xa0] because it wasn't right in the beginning had to go back had to do it again wasn't right had to go back find out the other things they made other things better of things great had to go right go get it again go try it go do it again not right what else is out there what are we compared to until I felt that now when I launch there's going to be a place for my product in the market where people will understand that is exactly what I said it was there's no lying there is no you know false presentation behind the product Kevin Hartz multivitamins much more than multivitamin but more importantly it's something for everybody and more importantly it's to spark the hustle within all of us and it's the first there will be more but it'll be after I've mastered and done this at the highest level then I moved to product number two then I moved to product number three before you know it you want to see a [\\xa0__\\xa0] whole line that Kevin Hart is slowly developed and that people can actually believe in because I'ma be a product of my own product that's the best thing in the world when you're a product of your product has to work for me before I say it's gonna work for everybody else so you take this stuff goddamn right I take it how long am I taking it I spent all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] money I better take it I've been taking the the one that's launching now for about five to six months nice I've been taking this one I'm very happy because I actually feel the difference and the difference is just in the energy that you have with him day it's not an energy [\\xa0__\\xa0] pill but I do feel a difference in my in my ability to last throughout my day like I'm I do a lot man I do it [\\xa0__\\xa0] light so I told you I'm starting at that final 5:30 and I'm not shutting down to let 9 10 I saw a video once where you were taking a video of your your trainer passed out yeah like this

keep it it's if I don't do it then there's a lag I need to train I need to do it because I I'm mentally so invested in it now that when I don't do it I feel like I've cheated myself in a in a day or a week that I've taken off I feel like yo man I'm not myself because when I am doing it I feel like I'm always I'm committed I'm committed to constantly building and reshaping and molding I'm working on me so when I'm not working on me I don't feel like my day that's supposed to be about me it's starting off with the biggest bang right this is my advantage to starting off like nobody else my day starts off before [\\xa0__\\xa0] worms and birds get up I'm we're time to get up five five and that's when you start working out Jim 5:15 5:20 really 5:15 5:20 no food I don't eat I don't need before

making sure that I'm not putting myself in a position to get injured and overwork right so getting stretched you know trying to to do as much movement that as I possibly can like when I say I'm a little walking muscle I really AM so my flexibility is limited so right now that's my biggest focus so I'm about to start yoga trying to do that things that can just kind of keep me in a position to to not tighten up so I don't pull anything cuz I do so much are you gonna do hot yoga yeah do that [\\xa0__\\xa0] all the time do you roll it love it amazing do it every week yeah only thing that's kept me from doing it is the smell and it's possibly you never that's the only thing that's kept me out of it I was like you gotta move past that yeah blessa I hear I get pretty bad sometimes it can yeah the place I go to is nice you just gotta make sure that the people take care of themselves well you know he'll be around smelly people I'll be honest I'm worried about myself I don't know what I'm gonna get especially if you get there early in the morning you know eat you won't worry about farting yeah but the people that eat breakfast yeah go they are letting off and everything I'll explain that the killer Mikey was talking to me about farting in yoga class I'm the guy can't be eating no can't be eating before that early are you going I like to go either 6:00 a.m. which is rare most of time 8:00 8:00 8:30 depends on where which place I go to - but you love it though yeah it's great for your head - it's 90 minutes of suffering you know it's hot it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] you hundred five degrees hundred four degrees when you get out of there you feel like you did something really yeah and it just changes the way your body feels - in terms of your range of motion your flexibility all those weird connecting knots and everything just get opened up and you know my question is when you when you're just starting no yeah like like I will be is it extremely tough and a beginning again you just just gotta bring a lot of ice water just bring a big ol [\\xa0__\\xa0] 64 ounce one of those of you know thermal flasks of ice water make sure you have enough water and drink enough water before it I'm talking put me in a bag yeah just start now I don't need to be what people could see me just we got like a section in the back yeah well you turn left you turn right everyone's gonna see you yes I'm saying can I be in a place where they go see me in the beginning like I don't want anybody to see you're athletic man you're gonna be fine you're gonna be tight it's gonna be difficult for you to pull off certain poses but you'll be fine I'm definitely gonna do it I'm definitely realize it's a challenge I'm definitely 100% gonna try your [\\xa0__\\xa0] would you do too no that's next yeah that's next Justin I'm just on here listen this is where Rico was laughing because I say oh man don't laugh annotators I've never thrown a kick as I said whatever you show me right now is my first time doing it I don't I don't kick I don't know how to kick right so whatever you show me this is this will be me processing it for the first time and that day we did it we worked on and I think I threw a couple good kicks a couple good front kick and I said I said look after I'm done with boxing I said this will be my next test to learn how to probably throw some kicks and to move with my bottom half now that I've worked on my top that's my next hobby that's your next time you know jiu-jitsu is like that's the tough one in choice and you want to do that too I'm just this stuff as you get older you have to find [\\xa0__\\xa0] to do right if you don't find [\\xa0__\\xa0] to do you won't lose your mind you would get addicted to that I just wanna learn [\\xa0__\\xa0] you would like it because there's so much to learn that's the thing about it it's a long long never ending never ending never ending journey of [\\xa0__\\xa0] there's also there's so many different variations of each different individual move and entries into new moves and defense and then the structure of it is it's it gets so crazy it's it's super complicated my son my son does a my son is heavy into boxing in karate I got him meant to those so he he does them both so the reason why I want to do I just like to keep up with him so we can you know do things together I have trainers come to the house and we'll work out together he loves it so I just don't want to get left behind that you know we get 1718 which we'll say Dave I don't want that but we better back up when they start getting that much confidence I just want to be able to keep up and maintain so that's why I like to do it with them well it's good for a kid to to have that in your head which is not a defense confidence yeah you need that for confident it'll help you avoid things too well I tell my kids you know your last name puts a target on your back that you didn't ask for and we don't go and create problems but you should always be prepared for problems if they were to occur and if they do I just want you guys to know how to defend yourself so the things that I have my kids doing it just have the knowledge and understanding the worst thing is just not knowing you know they're growing up completely different than I grew up where I grew up you had no choice but to know if you ain't know how to fight that's your ass cuz you're gonna get tested there's no way around it you're gonna get tried you're gonna get robbed you're gonna get your bookbag take it it's am I gonna try to take snakes like it's the reality it's not a false reality that's real so if you're not prepared for it if you don't have any type of heart you won't last from where I grew up heart was everything and heart was sometimes saying I don't care if I get my ass whooped I'm not gonna be a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie y'all to think that this can't happen so I'm gonna lose today but tomorrow I'm gonna complain and imma firin you imma talk whatever that moment was it was about establishing any level of respect that you could and I respect the eventually turned into friendship from all so my kids don't know what that world is like they're never gonna have it so as a parent I just have to make sure that you have all the tools that I can possibly equip you with because my president have the ability to provide me with it they weren't a financial space to to take me here and have this extra curricular activity or this extra curricular activity or learn it learn it then exist that is the big conundrum of successful Hebert can actually when successful people have kids the what made them successful is dry I grew up poor too we were on welfare and food stamps the whole deal when I was a little kid and that always stuck in my head this thought like we might not have enough food like I remember thinking that when I was a little like what if we don't have any food what if we run out of food my kids will never feel that they don't understand what that is and everybody that I've ever met that's interest came from some crazy struggle yeah when they were young yeah and that's the thing of your you and I and most people that are doing well in life you're raising your kids in a completely different way then literally what brought you to the dance and the first that's the hunger of not being one of those people that's left behind is what makes you successful in the first place and it's scary it's scared because you know my wife my wife told me she was like you know I love that you're not hard on your kids but you always make sure there's a lesson within your conversation like I don't yell I'll yell at my kids nothing's gonna register when I'm yelling so I tried my best to talk to you everyone I met my angriest I'm gonna talk to you so you can process this because you need to understand what's the problem you need understand what's wrong and what I had to really realize is they didn't ask to be born into this yeah you know I mean like that it's not their fault right that they're coming up completely different than how we were raised right and we can't have anger or frustration that's dedicated and thrown towards them because they got it so much better than what we had how do we make sure to be passed down to proper lessons so that they appreciate and understand and not take for granted right they have right for me it's tough because good kids good students their plot themselves in school they listen they don't do dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah they want to play video games and stay up like any other kid there's no signs of a bad or crazy yeah and the fear and panic is that you got a note it bad and crazy exists right this fairy tale day we're in isn't real and at some point when I'm not around when your mother's not around when you have friends or other family on around you may get tested with the other side that's out here that you've never seen right so I gotta prepare you for the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that you don't know exists I gotta take you to Philadelphia so you can see I try to show my kids where I grew up thinking that's going be like oh my goodness backfired it's so cool can we live here shut up [\\xa0__\\xa0] you told my everybody here the car right now around you talk like this move your back this does not go well supposed to oh my gosh so cool dad is so different oh my goodness walked him around a neighborhood and it's like it's it's it's not a reality you didn't have grass and that's dad oh that's great would you play why were you here yeah when you hear these things it's so different man these were your steps the steps are broken how did you even play oh my god dad so wait we're weird was yours we lived on the top floor not the whole thing no it's this is three separate units so the top floor was me and grandmom's the middle that was somebody else that was a neighbor and downstairs or somebody else three different people lived in this one thing together y'all with strangers my own hands I don't know I don't know what's say it this part yeah right in the car but but when you see that that's the reality that you get hit with of I gotta make sure that I'm talking I gotta make sure that I'm constantly teaching yeah if I'm not and I'm not doing my part I'm failing you know took them to the neighborhood and showed them how stores are in the neighborhood it's what we got candy from here's here's what we would get little sandwiches from y'all walk we don't have no stores like this we can't walk this stuff it's a completely different world well it's a completely different world see people stand on the street corners what they doing they're big they selling drugs that's that's tough right there those are people that your dad still knows they've been there forever that's what you don't want to do but they're forced with these decisions just because of what they have to do you just need to see this dad is taking you here to see this drove them all around all around North Philadelphia all around South Philadelphia made sure they could see yeah physically see we go out the country we go to these resorts and islands before we go they're gonna drive around so you can see what exists before you get to this this is why we have to be good people this is why we treat everybody with respect this is why your dad likes to give everybody doesn't have I'm constantly beating my kids with that information because if you assume that everybody does you come off like such an [\\xa0__\\xa0] when you're around people that don't yeah like how did you you don't also the advantage that they had growing up the way they are now it's such a rare thing and they don't understand it there's no way there's a small percentage yeah a very small percentage and that's something that I never want to let go of either so I was in the back of my head are you talking about how you know are we gonna have enough food you were coming up Chris Rock's joke is so great that he used to tell the hi he keeps a bag packed at the front door cuz he don't believe that this [\\xa0__\\xa0] is his I truly believe you thin at any point somebody gonna go gotcha you thought you lived here did you visit joy and I was like it's so real because even though you have it you can't lose the sight a reality of where you once was yeah do you are you comfortable where you are now or do you still have those thoughts like this is this real because you you're at this stratosphere of Fame and success that's it's rare amongst the rare hmm you know it's like David Goggin says you are uncommon amongst uncommon men I will be a hundred percent honest and say I'm comfortable with the understanding of hard work brings great rewards this is a reminder of the hard work and dedication that I put into everything that I've done I'm not content because I know where I came from and I don't ever want to go back that doesn't mean I don't want to go back to the city that doesn't mean I'm gonna go back to the people that means I don't want to go back to living like I once was I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna help I want to inspire what a motivate I want to show people that there is a way out that there is a way to do more to get more to obtain more but I personally don't want to lose all that I've been able to get so I need to make sure that I do everything to keep it so I can't be content mmm so there is an understanding but I refuse to click on the switch of so even if you like even if you have more money than you'll ever spend for the rest of your life that's not what it's about it's about the inspiring people and the influence and constantly giving back and moving forward in a positive way and the only way you can do that is to stay active it's the story man yeah you know we're we're all writing a book what's your book look like mmm what is your [\\xa0__\\xa0] book look like like your life is a bulk you got a bunch of chapters in your book but when they closed that book how good was the book how good was your book what was the ending to your book if the ending to my book can be so amazing because of all that was done the money all that was accomplished the first to do the man that did this he caused a merger between this because of his commitment and growth to this the communities were then given this made education this changed the way the schooling was Baba Baba gave books gave computers gave all of the things that can be associated with you and your existence become a part of the chapters in your book so my drive is about my book I was a New York Times number-one bestseller people will be done they did it I'm writing another book you ready to vote right now yeah what's it happened what happens if you are to Tom New York Times number-one bestseller if you get the two what happens if you get the three hey man how do books become successful who publishes them I want to start a publishing company heartbeat publishing why not mmm that's the thing all I'm doing is sparking the awareness and others to go why might why can't I create why can't I start why can't I be a business why can't I be a CEO why can't I be a tech guru why can't I [\\xa0__\\xa0] create cooking products lotions since there's so much that some people just don't understand they can do let me be a spot to show how much how many different you don't have to do just one thing when it's all said and done my book is gonna be full of all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] that Kevin Hart did cuz I never was content with doing just one two or three why not Kevin why are you creating [\\xa0__\\xa0] health and wellness products why not I'm big on health and wellness why can't I why can't I try to create something that I filled is [\\xa0__\\xa0] great and jump into a space that I'm already in I already give a hundred percent of me in this space why not why can't I talk about financial wealth why can't I go back and educate those that don't know why not you got time I make time well you certainly can but it's just so unusual that someone dedicates that much energy and time to giving back and getting involved with the kind of projects that you're talking about as well as be super ambitious with your own career it makes me happy yeah I could tell I'm genuinely happy discovery makes me happy like when you find different things to be excited about it makes me happy and it's weird when it clicks and schooldays to tell you all the time information is key read these books there's so much knowledge [\\xa0__\\xa0] that book time to read that book I want to go home goddamn Sonic the Hedgehog I want to play I'm at level 3 I got something to read this book the information is stuff there it was forced down your throat at a certain age you just you just may not be receiving it correctly but then it clicks you may gain information differently and what you do with that information is up to you but people people have different roles they can go down the education wasn't my pick of choice it didn't do it for me but the knowledge in the common sense that I have naturally allowed me to gain information apply it differently it allowed me to grow smarts in so many different avenues to where I said oh my god I found my niche I found my talent and now there's other things that my talent can take me to I don't have the all the knowledge and awareness but I can allow myself people to do that can teach me because now guess what learning is cool ya know what happened you don't have to do it anymore right it's its own you're a kid they force you into this school you don't want to learn but then when you get out and you realize like oh this actually benefits me does it make me a better person this makes me wiser it's 100 percent dirty and it's weird how it happens but when you go oh my god learning and knowledge is power mmm [\\xa0__\\xa0] they used to tell me this when I was 10 my quads yes mom sons 10 11 years old I heard that [\\xa0__\\xa0] all the time now I finally get it damn I'm about to be 40 took me all this time to get the goddamn code but I got it yeah it hits you at a different time mm-hmm and when it does be excited about it man you excited I'm excited about what 50 years I'm just now getting to 40 do you read books I don't read a lot of books do you listen to books on tape I have listened to books you know what let's do what Tony Robbins he's great Tony's a like I like his approach to giving information mm-hmm I like his attitude in general I like podcasts I like things that are real and out of presented in front of me I like information that I can go to the source and and touch and talk so I'm I and I'm reading a book it's a book that was recommended by such-and-such and the person who gave it to me and that's reading that book I learn more about the individual that I thought I already knew and now I gain more Michelle Obama's book great book great [\\xa0__\\xa0] book I met her I talked to her I've been in the same rooms I've seen her success what is her book gonna be about mmm or read a book Wow I get it I get wise moving all the units that it's moving I get why women are reading his book and walking away feeling better feeling like they can't I get it oh wow hmm certain friends Dwyane Wade wrote a book focused on being a father his road to becoming a better father what he went through with his kids mother he developed a relationship than a bond with his sons like nobody else Wow didn't know that day that's dope I love how you put it on page there's certain things that you just want to know certain books help I understand why people read books I get what the information does you know the book that I'm working on now is all about the mental approach that you have with life and people not understanding that your biggest enemy is you my whole book is about you battling yourself people to understand is you against you the only person that gets in your way is you nobody else is you now when you write a book like this and especially about something like this this is like the way you've managed to navigate through life mm-hmm are do you do you write it out in essays do you do you do you have like bullet points that you you think about and then once you have those bullet points you had then you write on those how do you do it get on your phone it's all all voice notes and transcripts okay so because of your time you don't have you don't have the the time to sit and actually write mm-hmm so you need somebody that you can talk to for hours hours hours on it hey I need a hour but I gotta holler for me I got some stuff we want to talk to you about keV what what's that all right book title ideas subtitle ideas my dedication is my introductions within my introductions these are all powerful paragraphs and things that I was just said that are now transcript I get to go back and read it come see here there's no conversation at all every one of them um no conversation all and that's what the Internet has allowed people to do Internet has allowed people to skip steps 1 through 30 as a lot of people to jump straight to 100 [\\xa0__\\xa0] you good job off take them down you should be dead oh god [\\xa0__\\xa0] can't stand this whatever the hater the anger is when listen when listen ok when I listen and I can change I'm not that guy we're doing these weird things now that people aren't taking the time to sit and think through what I've understood is that what people are doing has nothing to do with me I should always be a step ahead because I'm thinking differently because I'm thinking about myself making myself better puts me in a position to make others better be the example not the problem the best way to take away the problem is to a lien 8 yourself from it these are business thoughts oh it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] thought I can go through and just read this is a so you just have these philosophies of your life and you just just speak it listen just speak it dance so now this is all chance capable Columbus's that's incredible there's all [\\xa0__\\xa0] transcript this is all Sarge's go back throughout the day and I read it and I say this is great this makes sense this didn't let me reword this I mean make sure that it's all flowing together and at the end of the day what's my reason for the book my reason for the book is make you better my reason for the book is to make people understand yeah we all agree we all should think that we're great there's no reason for you to not think that you're great if you don't think you're great ask yourself why why don't you think the highest of yourself when you do people have no no choice but to follow suit mmm you had no choice but to follow suit a lot of people they base it on their past they base it on the life that they've experienced up until this moment makes you better yeah it does make you back you better make you smarter yeah unless you say it yeah man that's what's interesting about it that's what's interesting about life you can hear a guy like you say that and then it changes your perspective and then you'll go out and take action that you might not have taken before I had a 585 on my SAT confessions I didn't take money confession they give you 404 put your name on a paper it's true story Wow I guessed a BAC a da I did abracadabra true story swear to God hand on my mother's grave a BAC a da I didn't care because there was a class trip that same day I wanted to go great adventure I was told they're not taking my SAT seriously but prohibit me from furthering myself in life that's what I was told at the moment I said damn maybe I should have maybe I should've applied myself maybe I should have been different when I saw my friends get their test scores back and they were ecstatic 800-900 960s everybody's going to college I felt like the biggest idiot in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] world the biggest idiot in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] world because the same people that I want to rush to go to great adventure with they had taken an SAT a week before they already got their work done mmm they did everything they were supposed to do so that moment of fun was real fun for them I was the only dumbass that didn't prioritize and take care of my [\\xa0__\\xa0] so I'm the only one going to Community College everybody's else off to Villanova Temple University Drexel University god damn I just got left behind why didn't y'all tell me that y'all did it the week before how come you only tell me that we was serious about the college [\\xa0__\\xa0] you ain't tell me I was trying to go to simple or Drexel all wait it's because my life isn't their life they're focused on themselves wow that they're doing what they're supposed to do hey jackass go sit by yourself and figure it out cuz that's where you should be lesson learn any opportunity given should be taking series from this point on because if not you can find yourself feeling just like this it's not I get down on myself a [\\xa0__\\xa0] moment I learn from it I learned from it now I got to take a goddamn test you best believe I'm studying for that [\\xa0__\\xa0] test cuz I don't want to feeling like I'm the guy mmm that didn't prepare now I got a story to tell my kids about what it feels like to be the kid in class that didn't prepare that's got the words great when they give all those grades back but it's because of my experience I don't look down on those moments you take those moments you make the best of them because their life lessons it's that simple you're saying it's positive but it's really just simplicity that's real real it's real and it's your life experience and it's your life's lessons 100% but the fact that a guy like you comes out and talks about it like that that's where it makes it really powerful because it's not just something that you learn from but now other people can learn from your past too that's what I'm hoping they'll look at themselves and they realize like we all start from a different spot you're not saying yeah this is why I'm so candid I'm so candid I'm so open they're there there is no like guys I'm fine with being an open book I'm fine with the good the bad ugly I'm fine being flawed I'm fine with all the things that have happened to me that have been exposed I'm fine with it all I don't hide from it I don't run from it I don't I don't avoid any of it I'm fine it's all right it's a bed that I made for myself I happily lay in it and I'll be fine figuring it out moving forward son don't stop for nobody man son don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] stop so I'm gonna be up in the morning regardless that son is gonna be up in the morning regardless of how I [\\xa0__\\xa0] feel and how depressed I am the Sun is gonna [\\xa0__\\xa0] shine in the morning and the night time the moon gonna be there and you gonna look up these days gonna keep going by so do you let the days go by and look up and you don't wasted a year doing what what do you just pick it up alright I'll figure it out made some mistakes life goes on let me figure out life from this point I'm a life goes on type of guy you're a bad [\\xa0__\\xa0] Kevin Hart very very very inspirational and I'm really glad you came down here and talked about I'm I'm more than glad I think that it took too long actually and this is the first of what will be many men I'm for sure I'm a fan too and I just think what you're doing is not just inspirational in terms of like what you've been able to achieve and who you are but also inspirational and how you're so dedicated to helping other people that means a lot to me it's very it's very motivating it's very powerful I wanna I want all your listeners know that it's not it's not at all no this is this is no way it could be you if you were doing that just for talk and be like listen just fake it and then become that guy because you're honest if you could do that and just say it and talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] forget about whatever it's fake or not don't you guys trust me you will be seeing more the financial fitness is real this relationship with Chase and no she's making sure you put me in a position to give the information that I have and to the people that really need it that's the priority I will be sending more kids to college this year shouts out to 20 Robbins who's matching my donation so you know I think I'm going to end up probably probably having about a good million 21.5 where we take it we just dedicate that money and we just provide free education UNCF helps me as well that's a priority like I said this health and wellness side you'll see more from me vital so calm you know get a part of this hustle go get yours irresponsible on

       "[Document(page_content=\"here we go in five four three two one yes and all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] people that make me feel lazy in this world is - okay make me feel you in the rock you [\\xa0__\\xa0] don't look like you ever sleep and I don't know no days off that's why I love is unattractive ass he's a he's a person that that motivates me inspires me in effect that we're we're coworkers were friends I think is I think it's like it's a blessing it's a blessing to be around that yeah because it truly it's it's uplifting you know it makes you it just makes you weed out the circle when you're around people that truly give you like give you some good serve a good value to you and your life you then look at those that don't and you can you can then push away so I'm big on I'm big on personality I'm big on energy I'm big on will and once I believe that is contagious so if you have a bunch of laziness and a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] around you naturally it's gonna feed off you're gonna find yourself becoming what's in your environment so I feel the exact same way and when I see I see that in you I see that in you I've seen avatar I see you I see you yeah but a guy like that like I always wonder like how much of that is look I've had sleep experts on the podcast to tell you like like there's real problems if you don't get enough sleep like you could you have a much higher risk of Alzheimer's well there's other serious issues but I see a guy like the rock I'm like how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] does he sleep what where's the room to for sleep you know that that's true I can't say that I'm that I've witnessed the sleep patterns but he's a he's a late ass so he does I know he's sleeping to some rest which is well-deserved but you know when you when you say you had these sleep experts and stuff on it's always a thing that I go back and forth about because what is enough sleep like I'm a person I function high off of six to seven hours yeah six seven hours I'm I'm functioning yeah five hours I'm great do I do the five hour thing all the time no but if I have to I'm fine I don't need the eight and the nine like that's too much for me like I'm I'm an early riser and now I'm getting older you know if I can get in that bed by 9:30 or 10:00 on an off workday I'm very happy with that but then I'm up at 5:30 I'm up at 5:00 so what is it enough sleep what do they tell you this really depends on the person there are people that have a gene where they can just sleep for hours at night I got gone oh my god I got that what is that gold what is that what does this means you got special gene goddamn right Amalia yeah that's um [\\xa0__\\xa0] there are there are people that just don't need as much they can they can go a long time without sleep diagnosed me I'm one of those people you thought you might be I bet a lot of high functioning people are cuz your body tends to you get more efficient you know like you you're always going you're burning hard so your body's like when it's time to shut down it's like shut down get that five six hours in alright do you do well I will confess this I am an amazing cat Napper yeah I'm one of those guys if you stop talking to me long enough i'ma fall asleep right here it's something about silence real and just not doing anything and I just well it's probably probably going on momentum all the time you probably you're probably going on motivation and momentum okay then when your body has this break you've already here's a little sleeper that's just right I'm dead serious that's I know for sure that that's accurate cuz I'm how catnapping heartbeat do you feel like you've hit a good balance so this is what I was wonder about guys like you or guys like the rock when I look at your Instagram your social media and you're just constantly going like god damn do you ever feel like you do too much like maybe I just need to take a little break here do you ever feel like that I think perception definitely perceives reality you know what looks like so much isn't always so much because you have a schedule and you know within that schedule there's the things that mean the most that come in act is downtime you know me in my house is downtime even though it's still active and I gotta be dead and I'm with the kids and a wife in this conversation and I'm running around and I'm back for that still exes downtime for me like I'm shutting a work off so the phone is any office I'm not going back to get it until the morning and it's all conversation it's all TV it's all Taco Tuesdays it's couch and cuddling you know baby time whatever that's my downtime because I'm taking a step outside of the other [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's wise that's that's what I think I do very well I can step outside the other [\\xa0__\\xa0] I can separate it so I think when you're able to do that then you're you're managing your mental you don't mean like if it's if it's always one thing all the time that's how you [\\xa0__\\xa0] drive yourself crazy cuz you never you're never shutting it off yeah and I think I do a good job of shutting shutting this off and focusing on this like when I want my family I'm with my family nothing is nothing interjects or comes in between that's fantastic that's so important it's understand that's beautiful I doubt that's gigantic I think I figured it out that's it you mean you've got so much success it's all you have to be with that [\\xa0__\\xa0] phone all the time that's that that's the phone is the big one right well phone the phone is is the gift and the curse mm-hmm you know I think that we we shout out the gate and saw the gift oh my god it's it's it's community is connecting us we're able to share we're able to meet new people we're able to stay in communication with with all people find new people as entertainer I can engage with my fans and this is so dope and then after that you get hit with the the curse and the curses there's a there's a high level of negativity that's out there that's on that [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know there's there's a lot of people that are you know not happy or going through things and they interject a certain amount of negativity and hatred through these devices these devices are the easiest way to touch everybody so when you're just consumed on that [\\xa0__\\xa0] all day you start to see yourself being a part of the negative [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah so what I've learned to do is go I don't I don't need to see that I don't need to see that [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't I don't pay that any mind I don't read that [\\xa0__\\xa0] for what it's not it's not helping me it's not making me better it's not it's not pushing me to new limits if anything is taken up just creative space by me literally spending time going and navigating through what I think is is a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know so I don't let the device beat me and at one point I definitely did at one point it was everything there was everything you know now I separate it I'm not embrace clear of it what when you realize what it is when you see when you see the bad you know when you see the bad side of it I thought the other day this is some real [\\xa0__\\xa0] and it really made me think my phone died my phone died and I'm driving and I was using the [\\xa0__\\xa0] maps and I said [\\xa0__\\xa0] what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] am I get to with I don't know where I'm going I said I was like you know how did we how did we get from point A to point B before the map [\\xa0__\\xa0] what were we doing that I used to print out directions from Google Maps I remember that but then before that how did you get to the places where you were going that you didn't know how to get to I don't even remember remember Thomas guys do you remember Thomas Scott I did have a Thomas guy when I first moved to LA I did have a Thomas guy and I know look a hundred percent bill burr had one two a three years ago but it really [\\xa0__\\xa0] me up because I was like how do we don't even know how how to do the common yeah the the the norm anymore because the device has made everything available and I literally had to to drive to store rocket buy a charger charge up my phone to get back and use the map to get to where the [\\xa0__\\xa0] I was going I had no idea how to get there I had no I didn't know no numbers by heart I didn't know who I was gonna call oh my god this is the moment where I was like what level of success have I reach I just pulled over and I said here and I was like how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] am I gonna get the widow's bear phone man I don't know what it were a backup phone it felt like the end of the world if it felt like it was over house like [\\xa0__\\xa0] and that crazy I dependent you are but that's when the light bulb started to click yeah it started to click like how how do we function without I want to go backwards a little bit yeah it's still there I still need it I still think it's dope with all of the things that we can do want it but I still want to be able to put it down and step away from it my kids to be able to step away from it that's why when I come in the house my phone is up cuz I can't I can't [\\xa0__\\xa0] and get playing it's all about being on your phone if you see me doing the same thing right right so that time those conversations me wanting to know about your day you talking to me about your day your friends who you like who don't you like my daughter you what boy who what no ok my son yeah I like somebody who oh jesus here it comes it's a great thing and I want to be able to have those moments and you know I think it's it's it's big to make sure that you prioritize that are you worried about what comes next hundred percent I'm worried that something's gonna be way more intrusive than that it'sit's what do you mean it's already happening yeah the biggest scare happened already with the the the FaceTime [\\xa0__\\xa0] that happened where whatever whoa Apple on the iPhones it was like people could listen in to your oh yeah if you didn't need to pick up the FaceTime you could just yeah and you know that was the scariest [\\xa0__\\xa0] ever because it's if it's that easy to have a bug like that what's the thing that's not a bug that's there that you just don't know about oh there's definitely government listen to us well hunter is it yeah 100 everything everybody says and then in case one day you do something wrong they go by your side mr. Hart we'd like you to sit down from NYU something hundred percent yeah so the fear is the next level of them are intrusive you know I think everything has become intrusive now like the toughest thing for me is that there is no there is no privacy outside my home right you know the the amount of money that you have to now spend just on security on you know people to to be with me security to be on my home you know it's like they're there literally is no privacy and it's not a bit you complain about it because without the fans without the people that support me I wouldn't be where I am but there's no middle ground right you know there is no handshakes anymore it's it's how you doing right right right yeah a handshake is so much better right I get a moment like I'm we can talk if that's what you no no yo say it now weird cuz you you're doing this to me it's kind of weird to have a conversation so you're just starting to see yourself become a little older and wiser and uh just really see the times for what they are and see the direction that we're going in this people and just hope and pray that we find a middle ground because I think right now that is it one yeah that's what I'm feeling now no I feel it too and I especially I mean what you're talking about is you being super famous and losing all your privacy but everyone's losing their privacy yes slowly but surely it's it's happening to you because you're very famous and because you do something that's in the public eye and people want to see you and they want to stick that camera in front of you but there's gonna come a point in time where what we're dealing with now which is like you have to turn your phone on you have to you know you have to reach out to somebody you have to put something up that's that steps gonna be out of the way who's gonna be people being able to act that's your life yeah pretty you know you know the bad here's what I said it's bad that really [\\xa0__\\xa0] with me I don't like that negativity is the the want you know like like the the thing that's popular is the failure the the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you know the the fight that I can catch you know the hateful moment that I can catch and post like the bad is being highlighted and celebrated that's what [\\xa0__\\xa0] with me what the social media [\\xa0__\\xa0] now what really bothers me is you know when you see these things online like you know a fight and there's a man hitting a woman and it's captured right that's bad the bad thing is that you watched that the the video was more important than the actual help right or the moment to step in and you know when you see these things where you're catching people do these things to kids and it's caught the moment of what you got and what you want to post and get likes or whatever on is the focus instead of the help yeah and that's that's the part that is just I just have a hard time processing I have a hard time processing what the likes mean to certain people well you get an extraordinary amount of attention so it doesn't mean anything to you anyway it means something to a regular person but you a regular person if they can catch some worldstar video and put it up they're like dude that's my video that's my video look my video got 5 million hits yeah my video has gone viral my videos everywhere for them it's like it's a point of excitement that's why when they see you look oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] how often are they gonna run into Kevin Hart at you know Costco or wherever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you were definitely running right it to me on uh you know I'm in a I'm in a bathroom restaurant and I go to the bathroom you know by the way that I went to the bathroom you could definitely tell I had to [\\xa0__\\xa0] I was I was moving fast I was he knows one of those abrupt you know why you eatin yeah I'm eating bad so I didn't eat bad in a while my stomach immediately said that's not gonna happen today I get up and I go and literally like like three seconds I hear it as I'm walking or they go keV hard and as I'm walking by a guy gets up follows me in the bathroom he's like yo I gotta get a picture man and I said let me let me go to the bathroom when I'm done I'll take a picture with you I go to the bathroom this is a true story hannah bible hand on the Bible I assume the guys outside the bathroom cuz I as I'm going I see him and I say what I say I get done I go to the snake wash my hand he was just sitting behind a wall and he's like got his phone out I'm like he probably did he just take me while I was [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude put the phone over the thing like I'm about to be on oh my god it's over this is it this is my nightmare here we go they're about to put something up of me shittin is the bottom of my feet it's whatever yeah but he just waited and in that moment was so it was so important that he was in the bathroom and soon as I got a call on the second I said let's go outside the bathroom yeah let's take a picture it's a bathroom I said might am I going to I'm a nice guy man I'm gonna take the picture cuz I just don't want to lose you and I'm like there's not even a thought it's not even a thought about it's a bad price how weird is that Sebastin minutes this is a this is a pretty [\\xa0__\\xa0] weird moment man this is weird Halloween you will be the finish [\\xa0__\\xa0] no no what you got on your phone right you're too big for me to ask to go through your phone or whatever you got you got but I had to go out and take the picture and I remember going back to the table just like what's happening that's not strange at this point what is happening yeah that didn't exist before I think if you were famous before people just wanted to get an autograph or shake your hand what Pat what passed an autograph stage was last time you get an autograph it's been a while I don't write it I was I think I would know what to put that it's been a minute man yeah and I don't want to make this very clear you know it's not I don't I don't know you know I understand like once again I want people to more importantly understand the fact that I welcome it yeah I welcome the moment that I can talk in and converse with the fame but it should be that like it's normal people the moments are better when they're real you know and after a real moment you you get a picture because you're like yo he was actually a nice guy or I know I did it that you would be this calm and cool you don't even get to see how genuine of a person I am because the first thing you do you you you stick the camera in the face you and that's when people think that you're an [\\xa0__\\xa0] because they they they they have the intrusive moment that then gets met with the can you keep please I'm sorry you're not the you look at my face you're gonna be like that they look for that now you get your moment yeah you you look for the negative moment when does it start getting weird for you but how many years in um I know it's been it's been pretty crazy I've been pretty crazy for like the last four to five the last four to five years and the last three you know if it's gotten insane because now you know you're you're on an international level its global and the following is is bigger and it's all ages which is which is really really good but I think you know for comedians it's a different thing because you feel like you know comedians you know you're laughing we're in your homes everything is met with warmth so when you see a comedian especially if you're a fan of a comedian you're associating everything with funny and you're just looking for the funny moment right you're you're looking past a normal moment you know it's like you you almost are frowned upon if you're normal if you just chill right right right because everybody wants the funny moment right they thought you were gonna be funny like I'm supposed to I suppose a pop lock right on the site you know yeah if it's 2:00 in the morning and you run into me and I say hey how you doing man that's not enough when work out your [\\xa0__\\xa0] now mm-hmm I've seen you at the Comedy Store but only once where do you work out your [\\xa0__\\xa0] I like to go to random comedy clubs you know I think I'll go to New York first New York has always been a home when it comes to building putting some structure within a set that you trying to figure out once I got a skeleton of what I want to do I'll just go to West Palm I love that comedy club The Improv down there and all the place is great I'll stay for two weeks Oh real and just go and run through some jokes I'll go to Utah I'll go to Denver who do two wise guys yeah yeah yeah I'll go to comedy clubs just random comedy clubs that you wouldn't expect to see me at but I'll do a hell of a run and the goal is to get out of there with just a foundation not to have a complete set I just want to get a foundation so when I'm done getting the foundation then I'll do a little comedy club run I'll do a full comedy club run where I'll just put two or three months in and it's comedy club comedy club comedy club and I'm doing seven shows a weekend and people are shocked that I'm there and then I'm doing it but you know that's my that's my gym that's how I work and I end up leaving that period of time with a complete set after the first three or four months that I spent now after that comedy club three or four months on that run then I take it to like a small theater I see what my laughter feels like in a small theater and I do a little run in small theaters and then when I finally feel like it's at a point where I'm getting the the laughs consistently and the punchlines are working and I flipped it back frontwards forward every direction and my story is a real roller coaster and it has an ending where I feel like we get off the roller coaster and we're happy and you don't feel like you were there for an hour mmm is then when I go test it out in every nough and if the arena if the last er sounds the way it's supposed to then I say okay I'm ready if it doesn't then I'll go back to small theaters and then I'll go to an arena again so not to that arena sounds the way it's supposed to do I say I'm going on tour so sometimes it takes me about a year a year and three months here in four months you know people don't say how hard it is to develop our of stand-up material people act like you just turn on a new hour it's it's an hour to get to an hour you're going through four to five hours of [\\xa0__\\xa0] that you thought was funny yeah to come up to that hour that you finally say this is gonna be the representation of me this year yeah it's a lot for me to do that especially at this level you know well especially while you're always doing movies and you're always busy with a bunch of other stuff to stuff yourself yeah you don't take any breaks white or I actually you know when I'm touring if there's a movie I make the movie schedule around the torso my shooting days will go Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday rap Thursday maybe ever show Thursday night and then I'm going Thursday Friday Saturday sometimes no show Sunday sometimes show Sunday depending on what the work schedule and the workload for the following week would look like so I'm implementing that in so when I say I'm out I'm out I'm gone yeah so I've knocked that movie out in two months and then when I'm not that tour schedule shifts so the Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday dedicated the family dedicated to an office everything then those weekends are torn but that's all last for a year and a half I mean this year we did 157 shows on my irresponsible tour Wow 157 show before you decided to put it on the Netflix special yeah we did the Netflix the taping I think I did it three weeks before we were done so we probably had 143 shows oh wow then I taped it and finish the tour did you always have this kind of structure like when did you how did you design this thought-out individual yeah I mean thought-out individual it's not random no everything is planned if you look at all my stand-up specials there's a two-year gap in between them so the two-year gap is because at the end of that second year my new special should be coming out when a new special should be coming out I'm now focusing on what the next special is going to be so that first year is all development like right now I'm off I'm not touring but now I'm mentally in the gym and throwing all the old stuff that I talked about a way that's now thrown out can't repeat it can't say it now it's talking about what the new version of myself is going to be what do I want the conversation to be and what's my thinking and just taking notes so eventually now I'm gonna start just popping up a random comedy clubs and trying to figure out what the next thing is so by mid mid 20 I'm probably doing comedy clubs by the end of 20 I have a full fledge concept of that new hour and by the beginning of 21 I should be ready to go out with my new hour hmm end of 21 film my new our mid 22 that hour will come out that seems like a schedule a lot of people are doing now the 2-year schedule it's a perfect get yeah that's hard dude I know louis c.k did a year every year and George Carlin did every year but I think even he said really wasn't the right way that's tough a year stuff yeah I mean that's a that's a shout-out to those that can't do it I think that's amazing [Music] I think just for everything that I have going on and all of the different things that my hands are in within the brand the business I need to make sure that I'm giving a hundred percent change those things so they have the highest opportunity to be successful right if I'm trying to cheat it then it's gonna show you know it's not gonna come out to the best of my ability and with that stand up you got a you got a [\\xa0__\\xa0] magnifying glass on you you know you're always being judged off of what you did at one point just like a musician you're always judged off of the album that everybody thought was whatever so the biggest thing for an entertainer artists whatever your craft is is creation how you recreating yourself how are you constantly showing that you're growing for me the only way to do that is to talk about my life and the things that grow along with me the only thing that grows along with me my experiences my family my marriage my mistakes my UPS my downs those are the things that I can talk about further because as you get older things change it gets different it's all coming from my personal opinion of me my view on me and how I see Life you can't lose material in that state mmm that's why I stay away from certain things because those things can become boring after a while for me because I don't have the knowledge of everything that I should like what well politics I don't know joke in the politics I don't I don't joke and anything that has to do with the slander of others or other communities I don't do anything divisive good for you that's my that's my biggest thing and you know this past year was was one that got a little weird because I was like you know I've really dedicated myself to breaking people together like I'm I know that was my my goal that's my priority I damn sure thought that's what I was doing on a global scale everybody all races shapes sizes whoever you are whatever you are you can come to a Kevin Hart show I have a good time so when it came off as if I was a person that was divisive that was tough you talking about the Oscar Oscar [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah this is a time where people are just looking to be upset about things a hundred they're they're not looking to looking at you Kevin Hart as just a human being like what who is he who overall super positive they're not even concentrating on that I mean think about how positive you are and yet they tried to concentrate on some jokes that you did what nine years ago it was a it's a it's a wake up call of understanding the times but it more importantly you know for me it was okay I went through it I made sure that the people of the LGBTQ community really understand it hey guys I apologized before but I'm apologizing again I'm sorry I'm not that guy I don't want you to think I'm that guy then it just became the constant conversation there never happened that it just became the constant conversation and and now it is guys I'm not only sorry I don't condone anything that has to do with hate to anybody this is no longer conversation so guys I'm gonna stop talking about it because now I feel like I'm feeding into yes what not I I know I'm not the world and public should understand and know them not because over this time period I've shown that I'm not so the apology once again I'm sorry genuinely I'm sorry but then it just kept it just it never stopped and at that point I just made a decision and I'm like guys at this point I just I'm making a decision to not talk about it anymore that doesn't mean that I'm being disrespectful to anybody that doesn't mean as I'm shutting down anything it means that for me I'm gonna stop talking about it because at this point I don't know what to do at this point I thought I thought the apology is what you wanted me to do I did it I made sure did you understand that I'm not a hateful person at Noga don't hate I did that I stepped down so I don't take attention off of that night knows people that are there to be celebrated I don't want to draw attention to myself and what's around me I step down everything I did was for the better of good I'm stepping away guys because I don't want this to be a negative night or a negative thing and then it still became a conversation so I waited for it to die down I went on my radio show gave another public apology make sure doesn't he understand it I'm sorry I hope these words didn't hurt anybody I once again apologized I don't condone hate to anyone I hope that you guys can forgive me for those jokes of oh so now I say if you don't understand it you don't believe it I don't know what else to give I don't know what else to do there's nothing else you can do that's very wise of you nothing it's very wise easy to step away like that because if you didn't they would probably pursue it forever but I mean it's it becomes a point of attention that's all it is it's decided that this is something they're gonna focus on what I had a I had a good talk and I'm gonna talk about this for a minute friend of mine Lee Daniels you know man Lee Daniels Lee called me told me where to talk to you know Lee Daniels is director producer the show empire's his biggest shows you know so he calls me he's like everyone talk to you and and I was talking he's like look this is a time where you could speak up and talk about you know the community that's been affected by hatred and you know hateful crimes you can step up and be a voice and say that you don't condone or don't stand with any type of hate or whatever you can take that stage and do that and I said Lee I said that's I understand what you're saying I said well why did you expect me to know what's been happening with in this community in regards to hate and crimes I said I I'm not aware I said some people can just not be aware I'm not even no I have no idea what's going on I have no idea yes within that community I have no idea right when you tell me this I'm now educated and I understand so it's easy to simply inform right information is key when people get information they process the information when you can process the information you go oh wait a minute that makes sense hey if you guys think that I can don't hate wait a minute I don't and anybody that does [\\xa0__\\xa0] you man that's bad you shouldn't I can say that but instead when this happened it was become an ally mmm become a voice you know and that's that's where there was just a miscommunication that's where a back and forth kind of was established that I think people just started to take things and run with it and I'm just not I'm just not one to feed into what I feel isn't going to eventually evolve into a positive thing in a real conversation yes yeah when I'm trying my best to it was becoming tabloid [\\xa0__\\xa0] as opposed to like a real discussion click me yeah click click me that's the problem there's so much bait out there because it's such an effective way to get people to pay attention to things because as you said people focus on failure and negative and anger that's what we want to see controversy that's what we want to see people don't want to see the anger yeah and and you know we think that is because it's just the times it's it's that's what's cool now always being negative you know how you always have some people it's a great example how you have people mean you can talk about a movie all right we can talk about Titanic wow it's authentic one of the biggest movies of all time [\\xa0__\\xa0] great movie yes it was great movie and why guy for no reason go I [\\xa0__\\xa0] hated it yeah why yeah like Titanic [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] why manga yeah I know what tell me why'd you hate it I got time talk about that the cool thing is just being different I wanna I wanna be completely opposite Denali Contreras how the people you know what no no that [\\xa0__\\xa0] was ass what Wow Wow why was it ass we have people that just like to do this oh yeah for sure and and and what happens when one person does it another person for no reason all go yeah me too yeah she was ask man i hain't like it either did you see it what y'all talkin about you don't even know what they're talking about but you just want to hop on the negative train right because that's what's cool it's not cool to be positive it's not cool to be happy I don't know if it's a cool thing I think it's usually people that are really frustrated with their lives 100% what's the that's the factual side to it I did a joke before was like do you think Michael Jordan leaves YouTube comments like people want to get mad and complain constantly about [\\xa0__\\xa0] like that do you know what it takes to do this right here you know right here no tell you how I feel write in your comments section Joe Rogan you can kiss my you know what that takes what do you have going that you have the time to just simply be that negative and do it in this world you know someone's just a mismanagement of your time yeah it is so valuable and I don't think people understand how valuable they can be if they use their time correctly yes now have you always been like this always be sausages oh my [\\xa0__\\xa0] god man but always always really I find a light in every dark tunnel I will find a goddamn light man I hear at all you listen when I tell you to wait on my back it's so heavy of all the stuff that I deal with and I'm fine the reason why I'm fine is because I'm genuinely happy I'm happy and I'm not happy just because of the success success X is a bonus I'm happy because I truly know the definition and the feeling that comes with happiness I truly know it I felt it I felt it when I said yo what really makes me happy and I look at heaven and Hendrix and I look his oh I look at my wife I go yo I didn't have the family [\\xa0__\\xa0] when I was coming up yeah I got one I got one look what I did look what I built these people depend on me I provide these people that makes me happy that makes me happy when my daughter comes up dad you're not only my dad you're my best friend no I'm happy that's my world so everything else from the outside that comes in your your your throwing [\\xa0__\\xa0] at a at a at a bubble that can't be popped mmm it's a force field around me yeah there's a force field around me because what matters what really matters loves me wholeheartedly and when you had that and you understand that you're unbreakable so if you don't add to that force field if you don't make my force field stronger you don't you don't you don't get time for me my team heartbeat productions the people underneath my umbrella you're part of my force field you what I believe we all see the same things we want the same things so we march with the same beat you can't you can't shake that when you're an individual that seen that and understands that if you've never felt that if you have no idea what that feels like then it's easy to shake you that's why some people are easily broken being broken is not a hard thing it's not a hard thing so those that do get broken those that do get down those that do get depressed I understand I understand I don't I don't knock people for it mmm I don't not anybody for it what I also understand is that the encouragement that can come from so many can add value for those that may need a little push hmm that may need a little Amen pick your chin up it's so easy to be that positive reinforcement for somebody and add value it's so easy but some people choose to throw that aside and kick while you're down mmm I try to put out the light of positivity because whoever is out there you I don't know what it could do for somebody else but somebody else may just simply look at me say you know the way to he embraces his kids it makes me want to be a better father yo way to this man doesn't stop and await it every day he wakes up and he's just positive regardless of what's going on makes me realize that this [\\xa0__\\xa0] ain't so bad the way that he gets up and says hey today is another day it's the morning let's all be better than we were yesterday somebody probably needed to hear that the more that I can give that out and I can take my platform to throw good energy out I'm doing my part because there's so many that thought the complete opposite yeah I don't want to be a part of that that's beautiful man that's and that's true I believe you it's not it's not forced right it's not phony yeah it's not fake this [\\xa0__\\xa0] every day I hear [\\xa0__\\xa0] every day it's very contagious too I had a lady I heard a lady right [Laughter] lady rolled out a window when you gonna make a good movie again did you see the upside was good what's that oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's a movie it's one of my movies that's how us think I think it's a good movie I see that all right ma'am you have a beautiful day that's with such conviction like literally yeah I could have said a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] like she rolled a window down you could tell she still had the crank things that I could say to you ma'am when you gonna make a good movie it's napping I got one out the upside you see the outside what's that oh it's a movie so it's out now amazing it that's how she chose to come out here I see it I'm Jesus to come at you with a negative I get it every day when you'll be funny again trying my best but trying my best if it's not working for you hopefully I do better soon what do you what what am I gonna feed into that and add water right why why for what yeah for what it seems to have been working thus far are you getting this positive attitude towards life from life experience are you getting it from books did someone teach you how to find this I'm getting it from the experiences and from the the real understanding of perfection doesn't exist don't exist Oh mmm we're in a time right now where people expect perfection you expect perfection I don't know where dust came from I don't know what happened that this is the criteria for living my true understanding is all right you got one life and then one life the goal for us is to live it to the best of our ability from the beginning so what said the end in the middle in the beginning middle you're gonna do things you're gonna make mistakes you're gonna [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you're supposed to learn and then move forward with the understanding of what not to do and when you move forward life may get better it may not but somewhere along the lines is gonna click and everything that I went through back here was supposed to happen so that now that I'm here I'm able to go ahead with such a high level of knowledge and I can make other people better I can make myself better I could do more for my family something happens my dad is the prime example crazy drug addict in and out of jail life was very bad very [\\xa0__\\xa0] bad my dad son got successful son then took money gave it to his dad here's your house here's your truck here's your monthly at this age I want you to live your life you know made mistakes you can't rebuild and correct the things you've done I'm your son I love you you can't go back in and redo you can't try to keep going backwards ain't about me you got grandkids mmm gonna be the best grand pop you could be for these grandkids that's your focus now where's this energy devoted to being a grand pop for the grandkids don't worry about me but something happened in your life something happened that took you in the direction to reap the benefits of your son's happiness and success my energy is now contagious nothing I hand it to you so now you're able to give that off to all these other people that you're around something happens and that's in every single life in every life I understand that there's a payoff for bad eventually there's a payoff it can't be bad but for so long if you got the strength and the understanding to realize that [\\xa0__\\xa0] will change it will change it's impossible just like poker I don't know if you play poker or not I don't you play poker you can run bad forever but it will eventually turn around once you grasp the understanding of the game eventually it's gonna turn around blackjack you're never gonna be the casino but eventually you're gonna have a good run if you catch you run you'll do good get the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of there you waited long enough for it to happen here come catch it leave anything in life will eventually turn good no but this is coming just from your own personal experience have any role models that I'm up to you this way Nancy art did she speak to you like this about positivity and about my mom reinforced knowledge my mom reinforced you don't start things and not finish them you don't quit there's nothing that comes out of quitting besides knowing that you didn't finish we finish everything you started finish it if you're gonna do it do it to try and be the best not be better than other people be the best for you if you're in school and you're going to class I'm not asking you to get straight A's I'm asking you to get the best grade that you can possibly get give me a hundred percent all the time and I'm a happy mother when you half-ass me I'm on yes mom I want to do this I wanna I want to play baseball well then you gonna play my mom like that no more then why'd you start the season because I thought I wanted to do it then you gonna finish the season you don't quit there's other people that invested time and energy into you you don't just quit on people but I don't want to do it finish the season mom I want to swim then you gonna finish swim it didn't matter what I did I was never allowed to quit so now in anything I do when I pick it up a say i'ma start it I got to finish it it all don't work it all ate the best hmm it all ain't knocked out the park but I walk away saying I finished it I did it I did it right now I've been boxing I saw I saw you working out with Rico Verhoeven I'm [\\xa0__\\xa0] first of all very strong kicker huge man okay he's a big guy too man good guy but I started in jeans I started it and I said why am I doing this I'm not gonna be a professional fighter I'm not trying to be a amateur fighter I'm doing the guiness shape alright then I start getting shaped I said you know so much that I don't know about the sport I at least want to make sure that I'm paying homage to the people that do this for a living by really understanding and learning it you know what I'm gonna get a real trainer I'm getting some real people to show me everything so when it's all said and done and I look back after my training I can go I gave it 100% and look at how good I got look at what I'm a product of a spar I go getting really yeah yeah just to feel it so I can say it you know well sparse Bryan Callen is this serious no it's me yeah that's me come on that's me dude that's me it's getting it to look at this who is teaching him uh his name is Biggs he's in Atlanta that's me learn I had a turtle shell within punches but you know he's a former Golden Glove guy really good to you were in a cup and everything when I was at the sparring session when I'm I grow tired damn yeah I got touched I got my ass whipped and every couple times I go guys worried about that all good I don't go crazy we had gear and but I'm not in there with guys that are trying to hurt yes I'm not in there was touching guys that have no concept of reality yeah or control like they're they're just helping me understand right here's why you have to keep yeah that is a problem with celebrities trying to spar like if you try to like you know that's why Mickey Rourke started getting all that facial surgery I'm serious he's part of James Toney Jesus lashes she's not a smart right here that's James Tony's a mean man and it's just not you can't like I don't I don't go in that space have you ever seen James Tony talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] boys bars and there's some of the most entertaining thing you'll ever find on YouTube he's just he just won't shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up beating your ass he's talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's her and he's one of the best defensive fighters ever so he's really difficult to hit he's got that smells fresh and a in the world yeah I had a guy who's got any Mikey I'm sparring with Mikey Mikey hit me with three punches I thought I thought Mikey literally had like six arms this is the true story this I said I don't know what just happened but I thought I had my hands up in no matter where I put him he just tapped me he lets me feel it but not to where I might getting knocked out but I understand now movement I understand pivots I understand shoulder protection and that's my goal my goal is just understand cuz I can't do anything halfway okay if you try to fight somebody nope right nope I just want to say that I did it and I learn and I can move and I look the part cuz I put time into it well as you learn it too as you watch and you start get trained then you start to look at a guy like Terence Crawford or lumen Co and you go oh now I appreciate what you're doing because before you'd see like oh yeah I beat that guy up oh yeah he knocked that guy out but then you see like how he ducks under the left and fires back with the right you know Jesus this is precision it's insane yeah the the respect that I have for people that do that on a day to day is through the roof yeah and people that fight are in the most amazing shape in the universe yeah you're in the most amazing shape ever to move get hit for three to five minutes around come back do it come back do it and these fights go on and on and on I take my hat off to you yeah you get three rounds out of me I'm breathing out my butt I don't know where the air is coming from I'm searching for it it's a crazy way to make a living to money in your brain thank God I don't I didn't have to go down that route and you know to those that do just make sure you just put your body first like you said it's a it's hurtful when you see the damage that it can call us yeah we were talking about that earlier like seeing guys as they start to deteriorate and it's hard because nobody wants to tell him that either every I want to tell them they got one more good fighting them and let's uh maybe at the end of the year then we'll decide but right now we're gonna train hard and my stuff it's hard to cuz there's no option so they don't once you've established yourself as a professional fighter and you don't have an exit strategy you don't know what to do you know now at least thankfully because of the internet guys are getting podcasts and they're starting doing commentary shows they're talking about fighting and it's the positive you just found the positive that's the positive within the internet that is positive you just don't you just don't hear it celebrate it as much well the Internet's very positive for me I mean this is the show we do on the Internet I mean all not just podcast but YouTube videos and also information I know more because of the internet than I ever would have without it there's not a not doubt in my mind a more educated more aware person I want just the Internet yeah you get the things that you're able to find and search and I mean like you said you're you're able to self-educate yeah at a very high level these are the goods yeah we're talking about the goods so when you talk about positive Kevin how have you been yeah are you always like that it's this it's the things that I look at that are so easy you're not just positive though you're look crazy ambitious that's the thing that gets me about you in the rock for sure it's like the ambitions off the charts like I know your riches [\\xa0__\\xa0] like when when do you think you got enough you don't have enough there's no doesn't know enough I don't have enough because it's not over it's all over it's not over so you know when when you put a cap on it you're putting a punctuation to it mm-hmm and the the the ambition comes from seeing what's out there that can be obtained you know when you see what's out there like what can you mean physical things like well you see what's out there when you see where people are really gaining wealth and knowledge from okay the business relationships that you're able to acquire the people that you're able to partner with and create certain things different revenue streams what I found is as a young black guy from North Philadelphia the biggest problem with the biggest problem within our community is knowledge we don't know debt debt is welcomed because it's celebrated that's all we know and I'm get that credit card oh my [\\xa0__\\xa0] that credit card up and it is what it is they gotta figure that out I ain't got it after that yeah well you know what I'm getting student loans they gave it to me then after that [\\xa0__\\xa0] is I'm figured out I put a cable bill in your name you put it in my name we can switch it up whatever they do it there let's just put it in someone else name its welcome the Hustle is welcome the knowledge of banks and what you can do it can't do is it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] you don't even get it cuz you go to check cashing places reason like go check cash place because I don't want go through that ship the banks I'll trust that go right there to check heads please let me get mine let me get mine now take $30 whatever let me get it the knowledge is given so it's not to you obtain that knowledge and understanding that you go oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh this is why you put money up oh this is this is how you increase versus decrease oh this is how you earn on your money oh wow I can gain wealth by investing in what the stock world is what how many people partake in a stock world and is there a part that isn't necessarily gambling is there a low-risk part these that's not the information isn't there so it's not so I got to a certain level and a certain group of people where I got it and now that I got it I want to give it so now I'm going to give it I'm gonna give it to the people that I know need it most and for me that younger generation of black people that don't understand the cool thing is in financial longevity not in a now it's not in the moment for jewelry not in the moment for the car it's in the longevity it's in building so at the end of the day you can say look at what I have look at what I worked for look at what I have that's mine monopoly is real but you have to have the financial understanding and I teamed up I got chased I never done something called financial fitness where's just about me educating people on money how to manage money how to how to be smart with your money but it's coming from a person that [\\xa0__\\xa0] that money I didn't always understand it I hold in taxes before because I didn't understand it in the beginning I've had bad credit credit cards wouldn't take me because I maxed out whatever I've been there I've done it thank God I was able to fix it and get on the right path and now that I have the knowledge I want to give it could simply don't know so when you say the end game the end game is getting to a point where I've taken all the knowledge that I've been able to get over these years and really applying it and providing family wealth when it's all said and done the last-named heart is gonna mean just more a lot more than just Kevin Hart and comedy heart beat production it's got heartbeat digital your heartbeat ventures your heartbeat real estate there's so many things that the last-named heart will be attached to you real estate Kevin Hardin sell real estate a Bible stand by it but the reason why is because investment investment but but as you get older you learn this you learn it and and you know it's such a thing where you talk about black versus white you know a lot of people do that and and I flee so like there is racism racism exists I'm not unaware of that but there is a high volume of it that's that's non-existent people had a good people and when you can merge yourself with good people and follow the paths that you see that these good successful people have taken you then become a part of a world and group that nobody expected you to be it so for me I now have the position to do that and take all of these relationships and all this knowledge and take it back to the people that need it most I like to share I don't want it all by myself now are you doing this and the financial stuff you're doing this in videos you like releasing videos no we're gonna start we're gonna start financial fitness like I said with chase JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon very good guy to Shanda is well they're there helped leading in charge of saying how can we get to the people that we feel need the financial information of most so I said put me out there like let's let's go directly to the consumer so from colleges from high schools senior classes junior classes going out and talking to people before they go into the next stages of their life a lot of things that you should know so you're gonna speak to them and just share personal information are you gonna put this stuff online as well yeah yeah you'll be able to track and find content from it but I'm authentic so I said the best way to really do it is to put me in a position to be heard right I want to be heard like like it's a different story what I explained to the the people of JPMorgan Chase just when we were talking about this and as an amazing board of people that are just figuring this out and the best way to go and do it and I said you can't have the white guy that's never been to the hood or who's not from the hood or has no idea how the economy works here and what the real troubles are you can't throw that man in the situation to talk to people because I'm not listening to you from the gate because you don't relate I don't relate to you but throwing somebody in a situation that's lived it that's been in it that's been [\\xa0__\\xa0] up in it made it out of it and is now coming back to help run it's a different ballgame and that's what I want to be and you know we have other voices outside of myself very powerful voices that are going to do it as well but the purpose is to align ourselves to really make a change so you can either be the conversation about making change you can be actual a part of the action to do it I want to be a part of the action and in doing it you'll also be able to understand my drive you'll get why I do so much you'll get why my hand is in so much because I have access to it and the question should be why not yeah the question shouldn't be yo why is he doing everything he should be why aren't you why aren't you trying to do everything why not well that's the thing about a guy like you that becomes contagious like what you were saying about surrounding yourself with positive people and people that are constantly ambitious and that that there's fuel to that you feel good about that that's what you're doing I can I can say seeing you here right we walked around you show me a facility loved it beautiful facility you talk to me about how your podcast is grown to where you are now the success behind it I don't leave here and go yo that's dope of [\\xa0__\\xa0] I go hey I need to do more work on my radio station laugh out loud radio I own it it's mine I got a show on there but you know a Joe [\\xa0__\\xa0] motivated me to do more I want to make sure that we understand really what's out here within his radio world because I just saw my guy in his space and I saw happy he is what success he has I don't want to be you or beat you I want to take this energy and apply it to myself that's the purpose of seeing yeah that's the purpose of being smart with your eyeballs you should be a sponge so I'm a sponge so I come here and I look at how you maneuver I look at your setup I not only bow down and congratulate you I leave and I said yo man I'm inspired dude that's dope as hell John can't wait in two years you gonna call me you gonna see my [\\xa0__\\xa0] you remember I said I was inspired but you're gonna see what I let it grow into that's the proper way to get encouraged in motivating right as opposed to being a hater a hater and in competitive yeah i'ma beat you it's not a competition yeah I'm not interested in that either and I share the exact same feelings it's not a competition at all yeah so if you don't have people like that that are inspiring around you you might not know how positive it is and how it how powerful it is if you see someone that's on television or on social media and you see them it's hard to be inspired you don't know them but you're I can say look at your circle right and in your circle if the conversation is all about what we hate I can't stay in that song you see the new [\\xa0__\\xa0] car came out okay this [\\xa0__\\xa0] is ass I can't stand that [\\xa0__\\xa0] car yo man I can't stay in this city what [\\xa0__\\xa0] we even in the city what we eatin I hate that place it's so easy if you people don't even listen to it it's so easy to be the smallest [\\xa0__\\xa0] in the world the smaller [\\xa0__\\xa0] but if it's always hate can't stand these [\\xa0__\\xa0] headphones why we got these headphones ladies like a horrible day why the buzz here [\\xa0__\\xa0] that Stan it's hard whatever hate harwood how could you get a private table [\\xa0__\\xa0] hate this [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] chairs you're got better chairs I hate these chips it's so easy right so easy it's so easy to talk about yeah yeah and so many people don't realize that in a group you do it you ping-pong hate off on them yeah unless it's funny it can be funny just between yourselves trees yeah Patrice was it was one of the best funny one of the best 20 haters okay okay you bring up a good point comedic hate McConaughey yeah communicate one of the not one of the probably the best Patrice Patrice I remember when I would talk and if I was saying something you just hear what would you tell buddies what what are you talking about you like just the way you talk but what your voice everything about your voice just makes me want to punch you in the face we talking about when he would go after you - it kind of made you feel good - like if you're a comments especially if your comic like I called Opie and Anthony once I was talking them and Anthony anything he always has a gun on him Harry's a gun everywhere like he has a concealed carry permit and [\\xa0__\\xa0] and I said to him I said do you ever worry that maybe you're putting out this energy and you're manifesting something like some sort of an attack on you because you're constantly dwelling on it you always have this gun and Patrice goes don't believe in magic don't believe me conjuring up the world he would go after you man it's like you just want to step back and watch I don't know but he got bill burr so Marilyn Oh bill used to get so [\\xa0__\\xa0] mad beautiful thing about Bill Barbara would be snap at bill bill is the guy that's not funny where's the punch line in it there's no punch line he was so [\\xa0__\\xa0] mad we the Comedy Cellar the days that we had there man bill burr Patrice O'Neal Keith Robinson Jim Norton Colin Quinn myself when I say we would sit at this table we would set this table for four to five hours and it would be nothing but beautiful trash ins to one another when I say they used to give me so much [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's probably why it's so hard to bother me now the trash ins that I took from the age 20 to 24 and my young comedic career about how awful I was I had a joke I had a joke where to begin into my career cuz at the times let me preface this this was way in the beginning of my career this was a joke that I had about about little people midgets at the time and it's you know it was so bad cause I got robbed by a cross-eyed Mitch and the joke was I didn't know he was robbing me because I was with somebody else so he was looking at my friend but he was robbing me it was like a play on being crisis very very awful joke I remember telling his joke in a phone book comes flying on the stage put trees through a [\\xa0__\\xa0] phone book at me I told him this isn't where the Boston comedy club people in a crowd tiny little place all you heard was and you sit back it hits the floor I said and Patrice said read it it's better material in it than what you're saying that crawls does laughs oh he's uh they all might say they used to trash me so bad so bad man do you alleged a retreat some news story a corporate trees jerking off at my house before this is I moved to LA I'm saying the two double partment I just got there Patrice coming out I said yo you need place ass I got two bedrooms you can come near it's my ex-wife at the time you know I come home it's like afternoon like Patrice mi yo you all but tres but race I go out in the bag open up the door I said his big-ass computer oh I see is his back hunched over so baby oil right and I come in on my door he'll get out get out get out [Laughter] he's so sick he's so sick that he didn't stop he was so concerned with finishing then he didn't even break stride and turn around and not really nothing he get out yeah you just saw his back hunched he came out like seven minutes late it was like my bad i may use come home [\\xa0__\\xa0] for treatment I love him to death love him to death yeah he had the most don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] of any time I ever met it was most 100% yeah good and bad yeah you know there yeah there was a good to it and there was also some bad you know a lot of things that didn't have been for Patrese probably could have happened but I think the the level of not give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah prevented some of those things well he was almost too authentic yes like his like gypsy that was it Charlie Sheen's roast whose roast was it that he did what he just torture everybody else on the roast and then he got up there and you guys the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is this [\\xa0__\\xa0] who is this [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh my god Patrice has so many of those things yeah so many of things one of one of the best to do it if you if you are listening you're not educated I'm Patrice O'Neal just I ask did you just watch Elvin in the room one of his specials yeah some of that some of the funniest [\\xa0__\\xa0] ever man and so insightful mmm-hmm he was so why the way people thought and behaved he would say [\\xa0__\\xa0] like one of the things that he said that I I tell people all the time it's a it's a brilliant thing that he said it was forget what controversy it was but he was on television with some woman who was saying that you should never tell jokes about certain things you know and they were they were getting mad at someone I think it was Opie and Anthony about a joke and he said you gotta understand that all jokes come from the same place the ones you like and the ones you don't like the ones that make you laugh and the ones that make you mad they all come from the same place someone's just trying to be funny yeah like sometimes they just don't work I had a talk I had a talk with the I forgot her name I got I forgot her name but it was when I was doing all the promo for upside and they kept trying to break down you know where where where the jokes come from you know Kevin these insensitive jokes in that you told back then why what what makes you why would you even say those things and the hardest thing for me to explain I was like do you think people think of jokes and while thinking of them think that they're not going to be funny everything that you think of in a joke form you're thinking of it because you think you're gonna get a laugh behind it yeah the gamble is if I get the lab versus not get the lab don't get the laughs the joke was not funny if I get a laugh then I guess I'm on to something there isn't a bunch of thought that goes into the funny moments that we think may be great bits yeah I wish that I had a more logical answer to put behind it I said I don't especially at that time my career I just thought it would be funny the same way that some people think sir jokes funny the offer it's a thought comedians are constantly throwing [\\xa0__\\xa0] out there yeah you're constantly rolling a dice and Thor [\\xa0__\\xa0] out there had to [\\xa0__\\xa0] you roll and good right it's not gonna be good the other hatten maybe all right maybe kind of good but it's all with the intent of entertaining it's not with the intent of being malicious it's not with the intent of sparking hatred it's all trying to make you laugh yeah that's it like it's it's literally that simple from a thought within the comedian's mind yeah nothing nothing else they kept trying to look for this like hard definition of why and it's like I don't have it I don't have the reason why I thought it would be funny and it wasn't that's the downfall that's it that's it it's it's and the thing is about this art form is that up until ten fifteen years ago there was never any discussion like this it wasn't so so when we developed and when we were coming up there was no it was just like and there was always guys that would push the envelope way too far I believe Jesus Christ you see his new bid what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah and you'd be laughing yeah you tell it to each other and yeah and it didn't matter what it was joke about murder or rape or what some people just use those dark subjects like they're trying to make us laugh yeah in the meetings the comedian's comedian there's always gonna be though well you just innovate you all do you know Brian Holtzman 100% yeah but in Holtzman's that guy 100% my funniest dudes and and and there's no way that I could say no some of the stuff that I heard me say remember Susan Smith that lady who drowned her kids I I know I know who you're talking about her and I know the moment but I'm not familiar with all all that involved Holtzman was on stage that week and he's like I heard those kids were bad I heard they set that close to the TV they never put away their blocks there we spilt their milk those kids will not be missed yeah and you were just like oh I in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] like 9/11 when 9/11 happened they wouldn't let him on stage well Mitzi shore would not let him on stage four months after 9/11 she's like no way keep him off the stage I mean do you have you have the people just Sartre did they go for that they go for because they want to hear you howl and get back to the room do you know that like if it's you know comics are there in the back of the room they're gonna laugh their [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass off at that chair and and you know it's weird because right now within a times I'm the comedian that chooses to be sensitive to the times you know I've made the choice to say I understand I get why you shouldn't say certain things why you should avoid this that or this I I understand and I am but then there's other comedians that go you know what I'm more staged I'm gonna be me and I'm not gonna do that because people are telling me that this is what I I'm gonna go harder yeah and do that that's yeah that just exists it just exists but I think it's easier to just say I'm not a fan that comedy isn't for me right you know what I don't I don't like the taste of this particular comedian so I'm not going to support a watch that comedian I'm gonna find another comedian there's more to my liking I'm going to go and just turn my head like I want us to get back to just understanding that you just don't have to support it yeah that's it well there's a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] option it's very I mean there's so many today yeah there's never been more never been more comics I think about how many people were doing Netflix specials so many's never been more it's something so easy so I don't understand why there's a push to destroy which you just don't have to support it like I think it's just a bunch of people that have an ability to influence things now that didn't have an ability before and it's like they see a window and they want to throw a rock it's right there makes sense I think there's something that but I also think mm-hmm for us like meat for me in particular I really like [\\xa0__\\xa0] up comedy it's one of my fits like I like Quentin Tarantino movies where people get shot and killed yeah I don't want anybody get shot and killed in real life yeah but I like [\\xa0__\\xa0] up comedy yeah do you know Tim Dylan is yes I do pull up that [\\xa0__\\xa0] video that him being mega Kane he is a savage dude he goes so hard but I saw this video I was tears rolling down my eyes I was crying and I was like okay this guy's needed we need this right now because during this political correct push you got this big giant gay dude who doesn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] let me seize an animal watch this [\\xa0__\\xa0] and we're going to

Mike Tyson's I've never seen somebody hit their head harder in my life and I didn't laugh out of wanting to see this old man hurt herself I laughed because it was stupid to try to get on his hoverboard in the first place and when he got up he tells the kids why is it moving like this this video everybody because that [\\xa0__\\xa0] made me laugh some people were watching oh no no some people were watching to go oh oh oh another one just died [\\xa0__\\xa0] laughing because everybody's humor is different yeah humor is different my humor is different falling makes me laugh okay we're

funny [\\xa0__\\xa0] every me that goes that V you stick get out of it stay gas my little son 17 months when you fart I laugh something something within just ability to just be [\\xa0__\\xa0] silly and GOP oh yeah it doesn't always have to have a meaning behind it some [\\xa0__\\xa0] is just stupid my eight-year-old farts on cue she thinks it's hilarious genius she'll tell you that listen I gotta talk to you about something that's laughing she think it's hilarious she'll fall down the couch she can't stop laughing that's all you got it's your only bit as a kid nothing else but farts that's all you got that's all you've got to make people laugh you should enjoy it no he should think it's funny folly but falling is number one for me falling is number one my wife fell down the steps she got so mad cuz I didn't rush to help her I laugh she had a wine glass wine with all over the walls oh my god what are the worst Falls I've ever seen in my damn lap got up her shoe was on one step the shoe was all follow us funny I like it I don't laugh have fallen that much I just deal with too many injuries I've seen too many people get hurt it's not for you yeah especially old dudes fallen down hitting their head on Mike I start thinking about brain trauma and CTE long-term repercussions I'm near I'm right there with you it's probably better I'm right there with you there's the one that's going on today of this dude trying to come up the stairs on this other dude did you see that one the guy stomped them and set him flying like all I could think of is we don't see it in the video but that guy's head it's got to be smithereens oh my god he he had hit his head the way he fell back yeah you ever seen one of the guy who slipped and fell down a bunch of steps at the museum and falls in the water yeah he's going it goes in water Dumbo right you can't you can't beat that there's this dude this goes walking up the stairs and this dude's legs get the [\\xa0__\\xa0] off my porch stop leave me alone and he keeps coming he's like don't do it don't do it and he got boom smack the way he fell back you know hands behind him that's all head that's all head first of all to not see that kick coming yeah from a guy that says it's sad but you also have to realize a guy that size is carrying all that weight of a donkey kick yes that's just caved in my got stomped but to not see it once again I always thought that about fat people but if you really really fat imagine how strong your [\\xa0__\\xa0] legs must be strongly should ever yeah if you really get some power behind that kick and also if you've lost the weight you'd have these incredible legs that's a that's always a theory just it's Anthony but I was wonder if their needs are gonna shrink it wait what because you see someone from behind they're like 500 pounds like their knees are that wide I'm like okay is that the bone like is that fat around the bone like has the bone grown really wide too cuz your body does your bones do get denser if you do like heavy weight mmm like this if you look at like power lifter dudes they're do they're dense well part of it is not just their frame it's that they're constantly lifting heavy things so your body thickens up did you as you go but you know when when you know people that are larger make the the dedication to actually losing the weight and they stay away from like the weights and stuff and just do cardio it sheds off so fast yeah but he can't like I know I know a couple of friends of mine and lost like 130 140 pounds and like if now just fallen in love with fitness to the point where it's unbelievable like how their body is transformed and taking a liking to the new the new process that they're now in pretty yeah they get addicted instead of food they get addicted to being healthy exactly it's totally possible totally possible I've had I don't know how many people come up to me and said they've lost a hundred pounds plus because of listening to my show and having fitness experts on and diet experts and and just talking about staying the [\\xa0__\\xa0] away from sugar say don't eat late at night yes that's eating stop eating in a certain time and give yourself more than enough time to digest Cal your calories start exercising well with me I think the thing with me that helps me so much as I'm not a foodie you're not I'm not a foodie

fine I'm good you don't worry about eating healthy I'm a healthy eater because I'm not a foodie so it's not like it doesn't doesn't matter like I don't have the will or want to eat the bad [\\xa0__\\xa0] so if you're passing by in-n-out burger nothing no nothing nah man I'm black fried chicken fried chicken you showed me a process Popeyes Roscoe's is good too but Popeyes really pops

multivitamins which inspired me to start doing my home like right now we got bicycle okay I'm starting my own supplement line vitae hustle love to vitamin that we put out but let me tell you why doe I'm gonna tell you why I'm even getting into this space so when I look at physical fitness and I look at this world I noticed that you know you have a you have a great one in need to look like everything around you that you see like everybody like everybody that's a part of this world they look so [\\xa0__\\xa0] great and fit when they're talking about these products and the things they can do and I said you know what what I'm able to do and what I've done in my past I'm always bringing people together of all like in whole like there is nobody's alienated you know when I did my runs with Nike and before I got signed by Nike it was about bringing a bunch of people that never ran before and getting you guys to get up just come run with me just try it and you notice I got people out that never thought they were [\\xa0__\\xa0] do it and we doing five miles we don't ten miles whatever it's just a group run something to say we did I said how can I create a product where I'm putting people in a position to understand there's a hustle in all of us that's what my multivitamin is about it's the energy is the recharge it's the ability to focus is to approach your day with all of the tools that you basically need it's not just about the physical fitness aspect it's about the health so if I can actually motivate people to take the step in the right direction of health with a line of supplements that are driven for the everyday individual that may not know or be aware but wants to engage but you're not in it to look like all these different people you're in it to be the best version of yourself how can I do that teamed up with a great group of people to create the best possible products that I want to do and I said I want to be patient so it took me for you four years to create about us and how many different products you go right now just by dose vitae Hustle is my only one right now so it's just a vitamin just a multivitamin but it's an amazing multivitamin is it a single pill or is it a packet but no it's a it's a jar I should have [\\xa0__\\xa0] bought one good job a jar Jesus Christ so you like mix it in some stuff no it's a jar full like all pills yes pills okay um I'm gonna tell you the dope stuff this that's in it cuz I don't want to not say anything in and have it to where it's wrong so I always got it up on the screen man good Jesus Christ I get it hey you guys see it yep that's why you here we're gonna save that on my phone blueberry fruit extract scroll scroll back up there boron biotin beta-carotene vitamin A mmm-hmm what's all good [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's all good [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's more than a multivitamin I'll plan him in a it's good II what does that stuff Toco Toco trend all teletran out talk--i channels vitamin E family mm-hmm-hmm you ever heard of that Jim vitamin K look it up alright look it up it's a good thing too is that everything that's in it you know it's not only is it researchable but you'll see why like my biggest thing like as a guy that's not as familiar with the space I said who are the people that are they do it at a high level that I can incorporate into helping me build this product so I feel like you're never gonna do it by yourself you shouldn't try to do by yourself and you don't cut corners you don't go to cheap route you don't you don't do it wrong something you have to go back to do it again Brian so I went and I looked at the people that were involved with creating the quote-unquote best markets the best things on the market and I put that team together I put up a team like four to five I'm gonna tell you for years spent a lot of money developing this [\\xa0__\\xa0] because it wasn't right in the beginning had to go back had to do it again wasn't right had to go back find out the other things they made other things better of things great had to go right go get it again go try it go do it again not right what else is out there what are we compared to until I felt that now when I launch there's going to be a place for my product in the market where people will understand that is exactly what I said it was there's no lying there is no you know false presentation behind the product Kevin Hartz multivitamins much more than multivitamin but more importantly it's something for everybody and more importantly it's to spark the hustle within all of us and it's the first there will be more but it'll be after I've mastered and done this at the highest level then I moved to product number two then I moved to product number three before you know it you want to see a [\\xa0__\\xa0] whole line that Kevin Hart is slowly developed and that people can actually believe in because I'ma be a product of my own product that's the best thing in the world when you're a product of your product has to work for me before I say it's gonna work for everybody else so you take this stuff goddamn right I take it how long am I taking it I spent all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] money I better take it I've been taking the the one that's launching now for about five to six months nice I've been taking this one I'm very happy because I actually feel the difference and the difference is just in the energy that you have with him day it's not an energy [\\xa0__\\xa0] pill but I do feel a difference in my in my ability to last throughout my day like I'm I do a lot man I do it [\\xa0__\\xa0] light so I told you I'm starting at that final 5:30 and I'm not shutting down to let 9 10 I saw a video once where you were taking a video of your your trainer passed out yeah like this lifestyle everybody very unattractive sleeper by the way shots out to Tim boss Ronald over line and one of the worst sleepers you have a seat so you take him with you everywhere yeah my trainers let me everywhere Wow everywhere so you train every day every day Wow every day Sunday's are light days like cardio maintenance is what we call it not doing the same thing all the time we switch it up love switching about love finding new things within Fitness to make it fun you never want to get bored within it so your your whole purpose is just to keep your vitality up keep your energy up just to keep it it's if I don't do it then there's a lag I need to train I need to do it because I I'm mentally so invested in it now that when I don't do it I feel like I've cheated myself in a in a day or a week that I've taken off I feel like yo man I'm not myself because when I am doing it I feel like I'm always I'm committed I'm committed to constantly building and reshaping and molding I'm working on me so when I'm not working on me I don't feel like my day that's supposed to be about me it's starting off with the biggest bang right this is my advantage to starting off like nobody else my day starts off before [\\xa0__\\xa0] worms and birds get up I'm we're time to get up five five and that's when you start working out Jim 5:15 5:20 really 5:15 5:20 no food I don't eat I don't need before workout yeah I'm not I'm not I eat it before I workout never had didn't know what I am now because I'm getting older I'm more conscious of my body so I'm big with sports massages I'm big with you know making sure that I'm not putting myself in a position to get injured and overwork right so getting stretched you know trying to to do as much movement that as I possibly can like when I say I'm a little walking muscle I really AM so my flexibility is limited so right now that's my biggest focus so I'm about to start yoga trying to do that things that can just kind of keep me in a position to to not tighten up so I don't pull anything cuz I do so much are you gonna do hot yoga yeah do that [\\xa0__\\xa0] all the time do you roll it love it amazing do it every week yeah only thing that's kept me from doing it is the smell and it's possibly you never that's the only thing that's kept me out of it I was like you gotta move past that yeah blessa I hear I get pretty bad sometimes it can yeah the place I go to is nice you just gotta make sure that the people take care of themselves well you know he'll be around smelly people I'll be honest I'm worried about myself I don't know what I'm gonna get especially if you get there early in the morning you know eat you won't worry about farting yeah but the people that eat breakfast yeah go they are letting off and everything I'll explain that the killer Mikey was talking to me about farting in yoga class I'm the guy can't be eating no can't be eating before that early are you going I like to go either 6:00 a.m. which is rare most of time 8:00 8:00 8:30 depends on where which place I go to - but you love it though yeah it's great for your head - it's 90 minutes of suffering you know it's hot it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] you hundred five degrees hundred four degrees when you get out of there you feel like you did something really yeah and it just changes the way your body feels - in terms of your range of motion your flexibility all those weird connecting knots and everything just get opened up and you know my question is when you when you're just starting no yeah like like I will be is it extremely tough and a beginning again you just just gotta bring a lot of ice water just bring a big ol [\\xa0__\\xa0] 64 ounce one of those of you know thermal flasks of ice water make sure you have enough water and drink enough water before it I'm talking put me in a bag yeah just start now I don't need to be what people could see me just we got like a section in the back yeah well you turn left you turn right everyone's gonna see you yes I'm saying can I be in a place where they go see me in the beginning like I don't want anybody to see you're athletic man you're gonna be fine you're gonna be tight it's gonna be difficult for you to pull off certain poses but you'll be fine I'm definitely gonna do it I'm definitely realize it's a challenge I'm definitely 100% gonna try your [\\xa0__\\xa0] would you do too no that's next yeah that's next Justin I'm just on here listen this is where Rico was laughing because I say oh man don't laugh annotators I've never thrown a kick as I said whatever you show me right now is my first time doing it I don't I don't kick I don't know how to kick right so whatever you show me this is this will be me processing it for the first time and that day we did it we worked on and I think I threw a couple good kicks a couple good front kick and I said I said look after I'm done with boxing I said this will be my next test to learn how to probably throw some kicks and to move with my bottom half now that I've worked on my top that's my next hobby that's your next time you know jiu-jitsu is like that's the tough one in choice and you want to do that too I'm just this stuff as you get older you have to find [\\xa0__\\xa0] to do right if you don't find [\\xa0__\\xa0] to do you won't lose your mind you would get addicted to that I just wanna learn [\\xa0__\\xa0] you would like it because there's so much to learn that's the thing about it it's a long long never ending never ending never ending journey of [\\xa0__\\xa0] there's also there's so many different variations of each different individual move and entries into new moves and defense and then the structure of it is it's it gets so crazy it's it's super complicated my son my son does a my son is heavy into boxing in karate I got him meant to those so he he does them both so the reason why I want to do I just like to keep up with him so we can you know do things together I have trainers come to the house and we'll work out together he loves it so I just don't want to get left behind that you know we get 1718 which we'll say Dave I don't want that but we better back up when they start getting that much confidence I just want to be able to keep up and maintain so that's why I like to do it with them well it's good for a kid to to have that in your head which is not a defense confidence yeah you need that for confident it'll help you avoid things too well I tell my kids you know your last name puts a target on your back that you didn't ask for and we don't go and create problems but you should always be prepared for problems if they were to occur and if they do I just want you guys to know how to defend yourself so the things that I have my kids doing it just have the knowledge and understanding the worst thing is just not knowing you know they're growing up completely different than I grew up where I grew up you had no choice but to know if you ain't know how to fight that's your ass cuz you're gonna get tested there's no way around it you're gonna get tried you're gonna get robbed you're gonna get your bookbag take it it's am I gonna try to take snakes like it's the reality it's not a false reality that's real so if you're not prepared for it if you don't have any type of heart you won't last from where I grew up heart was everything and heart was sometimes saying I don't care if I get my ass whooped I'm not gonna be a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie y'all to think that this can't happen so I'm gonna lose today but tomorrow I'm gonna complain and imma firin you imma talk whatever that moment was it was about establishing any level of respect that you could and I respect the eventually turned into friendship from all so my kids don't know what that world is like they're never gonna have it so as a parent I just have to make sure that you have all the tools that I can possibly equip you with because my president have the ability to provide me with it they weren't a financial space to to take me here and have this extra curricular activity or this extra curricular activity or learn it learn it then exist that is the big conundrum of successful Hebert can actually when successful people have kids the what made them successful is dry I grew up poor too we were on welfare and food stamps the whole deal when I was a little kid and that always stuck in my head this thought like we might not have enough food like I remember thinking that when I was a little like what if we don't have any food what if we run out of food my kids will never feel that they don't understand what that is and everybody that I've ever met that's interest came from some crazy struggle yeah when they were young yeah and that's the thing of your you and I and most people that are doing well in life you're raising your kids in a completely different way then literally what brought you to the dance and the first that's the hunger of not being one of those people that's left behind is what makes you successful in the first place and it's scary it's scared because you know my wife my wife told me she was like you know I love that you're not hard on your kids but you always make sure there's a lesson within your conversation like I don't yell I'll yell at my kids nothing's gonna register when I'm yelling so I tried my best to talk to you everyone I met my angriest I'm gonna talk to you so you can process this because you need to understand what's the problem you need understand what's wrong and what I had to really realize is they didn't ask to be born into this yeah you know I mean like that it's not their fault right that they're coming up completely different than how we were raised right and we can't have anger or frustration that's dedicated and thrown towards them because they got it so much better than what we had how do we make sure to be passed down to proper lessons so that they appreciate and understand and not take for granted right they have right for me it's tough because good kids good students their plot themselves in school they listen they don't do dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah they want to play video games and stay up like any other kid there's no signs of a bad or crazy yeah and the fear and panic is that you got a note it bad and crazy exists right this fairy tale day we're in isn't real and at some point when I'm not around when your mother's not around when you have friends or other family on around you may get tested with the other side that's out here that you've never seen right so I gotta prepare you for the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that you don't know exists I gotta take you to Philadelphia so you can see I try to show my kids where I grew up thinking that's going be like oh my goodness backfired it's so cool can we live here shut up [\\xa0__\\xa0] you told my everybody here the car right now around you talk like this move your back this does not go well supposed to oh my gosh so cool dad is so different oh my goodness walked him around a neighborhood and it's like it's it's it's not a reality you didn't have grass and that's dad oh that's great would you play why were you here yeah when you hear these things it's so different man these were your steps the steps are broken how did you even play oh my god dad so wait we're weird was yours we lived on the top floor not the whole thing no it's this is three separate units so the top floor was me and grandmom's the middle that was somebody else that was a neighbor and downstairs or somebody else three different people lived in this one thing together y'all with strangers my own hands I don't know I don't know what's say it this part yeah right in the car but but when you see that that's the reality that you get hit with of I gotta make sure that I'm talking I gotta make sure that I'm constantly teaching yeah if I'm not and I'm not doing my part I'm failing you know took them to the neighborhood and showed them how stores are in the neighborhood it's what we got candy from here's here's what we would get little sandwiches from y'all walk we don't have no stores like this we can't walk this stuff it's a completely different world well it's a completely different world see people stand on the street corners what they doing they're big they selling drugs that's that's tough right there those are people that your dad still knows they've been there forever that's what you don't want to do but they're forced with these decisions just because of what they have to do you just need to see this dad is taking you here to see this drove them all around all around North Philadelphia all around South Philadelphia made sure they could see yeah physically see we go out the country we go to these resorts and islands before we go they're gonna drive around so you can see what exists before you get to this this is why we have to be good people this is why we treat everybody with respect this is why your dad likes to give everybody doesn't have I'm constantly beating my kids with that information because if you assume that everybody does you come off like such an [\\xa0__\\xa0] when you're around people that don't yeah like how did you you don't also the advantage that they had growing up the way they are now it's such a rare thing and they don't understand it there's no way there's a small percentage yeah a very small percentage and that's something that I never want to let go of either so I was in the back of my head are you talking about how you know are we gonna have enough food you were coming up Chris Rock's joke is so great that he used to tell the hi he keeps a bag packed at the front door cuz he don't believe that this [\\xa0__\\xa0] is his I truly believe you thin at any point somebody gonna go gotcha you thought you lived here did you visit joy and I was like it's so real because even though you have it you can't lose the sight a reality of where you once was yeah do you are you comfortable where you are now or do you still have those thoughts like this is this real because you you're at this stratosphere of Fame and success that's it's rare amongst the rare hmm you know it's like David Goggin says you are uncommon amongst uncommon men I will be a hundred percent honest and say I'm comfortable with the understanding of hard work brings great rewards this is a reminder of the hard work and dedication that I put into everything that I've done I'm not content because I know where I came from and I don't ever want to go back that doesn't mean I don't want to go back to the city that doesn't mean I'm gonna go back to the people that means I don't want to go back to living like I once was I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna help I want to inspire what a motivate I want to show people that there is a way out that there is a way to do more to get more to obtain more but I personally don't want to lose all that I've been able to get so I need to make sure that I do everything to keep it so I can't be content mmm so there is an understanding but I refuse to click on the switch of so even if you like even if you have more money than you'll ever spend for the rest of your life that's not what it's about it's about the inspiring people and the influence and constantly giving back and moving forward in a positive way and the only way you can do that is to stay active it's the story man yeah you know we're we're all writing a book what's your book look like mmm what is your [\\xa0__\\xa0] book look like like your life is a bulk you got a bunch of chapters in your book but when they closed that book how good was the book how good was your book what was the ending to your book if the ending to my book can be so amazing because of all that was done the money all that was accomplished the first to do the man that did this he caused a merger between this because of his commitment and growth to this the communities were then given this made education this changed the way the schooling was Baba Baba gave books gave computers gave all of the things that can be associated with you and your existence become a part of the chapters in your book so my drive is about my book I was a New York Times number-one bestseller people will be done they did it I'm writing another book you ready to vote right now yeah what's it happened what happens if you are to Tom New York Times number-one bestseller if you get the two what happens if you get the three hey man how do books become successful who publishes them I want to start a publishing company heartbeat publishing why not mmm that's the thing all I'm doing is sparking the awareness and others to go why might why can't I create why can't I start why can't I be a business why can't I be a CEO why can't I be a tech guru why can't I [\\xa0__\\xa0] create cooking products lotions since there's so much that some people just don't understand they can do let me be a spot to show how much how many different you don't have to do just one thing when it's all said and done my book is gonna be full of all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] that Kevin Hart did cuz I never was content with doing just one two or three why not Kevin why are you creating [\\xa0__\\xa0] health and wellness products why not I'm big on health and wellness why can't I why can't I try to create something that I filled is [\\xa0__\\xa0] great and jump into a space that I'm already in I already give a hundred percent of me in this space why not why can't I talk about financial wealth why can't I go back and educate those that don't know why not you got time I make time well you certainly can but it's just so unusual that someone dedicates that much energy and time to giving back and getting involved with the kind of projects that you're talking about as well as be super ambitious with your own career it makes me happy yeah I could tell I'm genuinely happy discovery makes me happy like when you find different things to be excited about it makes me happy and it's weird when it clicks and schooldays to tell you all the time information is key read these books there's so much knowledge [\\xa0__\\xa0] that book time to read that book I want to go home goddamn Sonic the Hedgehog I want to play I'm at level 3 I got something to read this book the information is stuff there it was forced down your throat at a certain age you just you just may not be receiving it correctly but then it clicks you may gain information differently and what you do with that information is up to you but people people have different roles they can go down the education wasn't my pick of choice it didn't do it for me but the knowledge in the common sense that I have naturally allowed me to gain information apply it differently it allowed me to grow smarts in so many\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW_KhFq4LQo', 'title': 'Joe Rogan Experience #1278 - Kevin Hart',

       " Document(page_content=\"is stuff there it was forced down your throat at a certain age you just you just may not be receiving it correctly but then it clicks you may gain information differently and what you do with that information is up to you but people people have different roles they can go down the education wasn't my pick of choice it didn't do it for me but the knowledge in the common sense that I have naturally allowed me to gain information apply it differently it allowed me to grow smarts in so many different avenues to where I said oh my god I found my niche I found my talent and now there's other things that my talent can take me to I don't have the all the knowledge and awareness but I can allow myself people to do that can teach me because now guess what learning is cool ya know what happened you don't have to do it anymore right it's its own you're a kid they force you into this school you don't want to learn but then when you get out and you realize like oh this actually benefits me does it make me a better person this makes me wiser it's 100 percent dirty and it's weird how it happens but when you go oh my god learning and knowledge is power mmm [\\xa0__\\xa0] they used to tell me this when I was 10 my quads yes mom sons 10 11 years old I heard that [\\xa0__\\xa0] all the time now I finally get it damn I'm about to be 40 took me all this time to get the goddamn code but I got it yeah it hits you at a different time mm-hmm and when it does be excited about it man you excited I'm excited about what 50 years I'm just now getting to 40 do you read books I don't read a lot of books do you listen to books on tape I have listened to books you know what let's do what Tony Robbins he's great Tony's a like I like his approach to giving information mm-hmm I like his attitude in general I like podcasts I like things that are real and out of presented in front of me I like information that I can go to the source and and touch and talk so I'm I and I'm reading a book it's a book that was recommended by such-and-such and the person who gave it to me and that's reading that book I learn more about the individual that I thought I already knew and now I gain more Michelle Obama's book great book great [\\xa0__\\xa0] book I met her I talked to her I've been in the same rooms I've seen her success what is her book gonna be about mmm or read a book Wow I get it I get wise moving all the units that it's moving I get why women are reading his book and walking away feeling better feeling like they can't I get it oh wow hmm certain friends Dwyane Wade wrote a book focused on being a father his road to becoming a better father what he went through with his kids mother he developed a relationship than a bond with his sons like nobody else Wow didn't know that day that's dope I love how you put it on page there's certain things that you just want to know certain books help I understand why people read books I get what the information does you know the book that I'm working on now is all about the mental approach that you have with life and people not understanding that your biggest enemy is you my whole book is about you battling yourself people to understand is you against you the only person that gets in your way is you nobody else is you now when you write a book like this and especially about something like this this is like the way you've managed to navigate through life mm-hmm are do you do you write it out in essays do you do you do you have like bullet points that you you think about and then once you have those bullet points you had then you write on those how do you do it get on your phone it's all all voice notes and transcripts okay so because of your time you don't have you don't have the the time to sit and actually write mm-hmm so you need somebody that you can talk to for hours hours hours on it hey I need a hour but I gotta holler for me I got some stuff we want to talk to you about keV what what's that all right book title ideas subtitle ideas my dedication is my introductions within my introductions these are all powerful paragraphs and things that I was just said that are now transcript I get to go back and read it come see here there's no conversation at all every one of them um no conversation all and that's what the Internet has allowed people to do Internet has allowed people to skip steps 1 through 30 as a lot of people to jump straight to 100 [\\xa0__\\xa0] you good job off take them down you should be dead oh god [\\xa0__\\xa0] can't stand this whatever the hater the anger is when listen when listen ok when I listen and I can change I'm not that guy we're doing these weird things now that people aren't taking the time to sit and think through what I've understood is that what people are doing has nothing to do with me I should always be a step ahead because I'm thinking differently because I'm thinking about myself making myself better puts me in a position to make others better be the example not the problem the best way to take away the problem is to a lien 8 yourself from it these are business thoughts oh it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] thought I can go through and just read this is a so you just have these philosophies of your life and you just just speak it listen just speak it dance so now this is all chance capable Columbus's that's incredible there's all [\\xa0__\\xa0] transcript this is all Sarge's go back throughout the day and I read it and I say this is great this makes sense this didn't let me reword this I mean make sure that it's all flowing together and at the end of the day what's my reason for the book my reason for the book is make you better my reason for the book is to make people understand yeah we all agree we all should think that we're great there's no reason for you to not think that you're great if you don't think you're great ask yourself why why don't you think the highest of yourself when you do people have no no choice but to follow suit mmm you had no choice but to follow suit a lot of people they base it on their past they base it on the life that they've experienced up until this moment makes you better yeah it does make you back you better make you smarter yeah unless you say it yeah man that's what's interesting about it that's what's interesting about life you can hear a guy like you say that and then it changes your perspective and then you'll go out and take action that you might not have taken before I had a 585 on my SAT confessions I didn't take money confession they give you 404 put your name on a paper it's true story Wow I guessed a BAC a da I did abracadabra true story swear to God hand on my mother's grave a BAC a da I didn't care because there was a class trip that same day I wanted to go great adventure I was told they're not taking my SAT seriously but prohibit me from furthering myself in life that's what I was told at the moment I said damn maybe I should have maybe I should've applied myself maybe I should have been different when I saw my friends get their test scores back and they were ecstatic 800-900 960s everybody's going to college I felt like the biggest idiot in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] world the biggest idiot in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] world because the same people that I want to rush to go to great adventure with they had taken an SAT a week before they already got their work done mmm they did everything they were supposed to do so that moment of fun was real fun for them I was the only dumbass that didn't prioritize and take care of my [\\xa0__\\xa0] so I'm the only one going to Community College everybody's else off to Villanova Temple University Drexel University god damn I just got left behind why didn't y'all tell me that y'all did it the week before how come you only tell me that we was serious about the college [\\xa0__\\xa0] you ain't tell me I was trying to go to simple or Drexel all wait it's because my life isn't their life they're focused on themselves wow that they're doing what they're supposed to do hey jackass go sit by yourself and figure it out cuz that's where you should be lesson learn any opportunity given should be taking series from this point on because if not you can find yourself feeling just like this it's not I get down on myself a [\\xa0__\\xa0] moment I learn from it I learned from it now I got to take a goddamn test you best believe I'm studying for that [\\xa0__\\xa0] test cuz I don't want to feeling like I'm the guy mmm that didn't prepare now I got a story to tell my kids about what it feels like to be the kid in class that didn't prepare that's got the words great when they give all those grades back but it's because of my experience I don't look down on those moments you take those moments you make the best of them because their life lessons it's that simple you're saying it's positive but it's really just simplicity that's real real it's real and it's your life experience and it's your life's lessons 100% but the fact that a guy like you comes out and talks about it like that that's where it makes it really powerful because it's not just something that you learn from but now other people can learn from your past too that's what I'm hoping they'll look at themselves and they realize like we all start from a different spot you're not saying yeah this is why I'm so candid I'm so candid I'm so open they're there there is no like guys I'm fine with being an open book I'm fine with the good the bad ugly I'm fine being flawed I'm fine with all the things that have happened to me that have been exposed I'm fine with it all I don't hide from it I don't run from it I don't I don't avoid any of it I'm fine it's all right it's a bed that I made for myself I happily lay in it and I'll be fine figuring it out moving forward son don't stop for nobody man son don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] stop so I'm gonna be up in the morning regardless that son is gonna be up in the morning regardless of how I [\\xa0__\\xa0] feel and how depressed I am the Sun is gonna [\\xa0__\\xa0] shine in the morning and the night time the moon gonna be there and you gonna look up these days gonna keep going by so do you let the days go by and look up and you don't wasted a year doing what what do you just pick it up alright I'll figure it out made some mistakes life goes on let me figure out life from this point I'm a life goes on type of guy you're a bad [\\xa0__\\xa0] Kevin Hart very very very inspirational and I'm really glad you came down here and talked about I'm I'm more than glad I think that it took too long actually and this is the first of what will be many men I'm for sure I'm a fan too and I just think what you're doing is not just inspirational in terms of like what you've been able to achieve and who you are but also inspirational and how you're so dedicated to helping other people that means a lot to me it's very it's very motivating it's very powerful I wanna I want all your listeners know that it's not it's not at all no this is this is no way it could be you if you were doing that just for talk and be like listen just fake it and then become that guy because you're honest if you could do that and just say it and talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] forget about whatever it's fake or not don't you guys trust me you will be seeing more the financial fitness is real this relationship with Chase and no she's making sure you put me in a position to give the information that I have and to the people that really need it that's the priority I will be sending more kids to college this year shouts out to 20 Robbins who's matching my donation so you know I think I'm going to end up probably probably having about a good million 21.5 where we take it we just dedicate that money and we just provide free education UNCF helps me as well that's a priority like I said this health and wellness side you'll see more from me vital so calm you know get a part of this hustle go get yours irresponsible on Netflix filming filming we about to come out Christmas there's so much so much [\\xa0__\\xa0] going on man listen if there's ever anything you want promoted you want

      "here we go in five four three two one yes and all the [ __ ] people that make me feel lazy in this world is - okay make me feel you in the rock you [ __ ] don't look like you ever sleep and I don't know no days off that's why I love is unattractive ass he's a he's a person that that motivates me inspires me in effect that we're we're coworkers were friends I think is I think it's like it's a blessing it's a blessing to be around that yeah because it truly it's it's uplifting you know it makes you it just makes you weed out the circle when you're around people that truly give you like give you some good serve a good value to you and your life you then look at those that don't and you can you can then push away so I'm big on I'm big on personality I'm big on energy I'm big on will and once I believe that is contagious so if you have a bunch of laziness and a bunch of [ __ ] around you naturally it's gonna feed off you're gonna find yourself becoming what's in your environment so I feel the exact same way and when I see I see that in you I see that in you I've seen avatar I see you I see you yeah but a guy like that like I always wonder like how much of that is look I've had sleep experts on the podcast to tell you like like there's real problems if you don't get enough sleep like you could you have a much higher risk of Alzheimer's well there's other serious issues but I see a guy like the rock I'm like how the [ __ ] does he sleep what where's the room to for sleep you know that that's true I can't say that I'm that I've witnessed the sleep patterns but he's a he's a late ass so he does I know he's sleeping to some rest which is well-deserved but you know when you when you say you had these sleep experts and stuff on it's always a thing that I go back and forth about because what is enough sleep like I'm a person I function high off of six to seven hours yeah six seven hours I'm I'm functioning yeah five hours I'm great do I do the five hour thing all the time no but if I have to I'm fine I don't need the eight and the nine like that's too much for me like I'm I'm an early riser and now I'm getting older you know if I can get in that bed by 9:30 or 10:00 on an off workday I'm very happy with that but then I'm up at 5:30 I'm up at 5:00 so what is it enough sleep what do they tell you this really depends on the person there are people that have a gene where they can just sleep for hours at night I got gone oh my god I got that what is that gold what is that what does this means you got special gene goddamn right Amalia yeah that's um [ __ ] there are there are people that just don't need as much they can they can go a long time without sleep diagnosed me I'm one of those people you thought you might be I bet a lot of high functioning people are cuz your body tends to you get more efficient you know like you you're always going you're burning hard so your body's like when it's time to shut down it's like shut down get that five six hours in alright do you do well I will confess this I am an amazing cat Napper yeah I'm one of those guys if you stop talking to me long enough i'ma fall asleep right here it's something about silence real and just not doing anything and I just well it's probably probably going on momentum all the time you probably you're probably going on motivation and momentum okay then when your body has this break you've already here's a little sleeper that's just right I'm dead serious that's I know for sure that that's accurate cuz I'm how catnapping heartbeat do you feel like you've hit a good balance so this is what I was wonder about guys like you or guys like the rock when I look at your Instagram your social media and you're just constantly going like god damn do you ever feel like you do too much like maybe I just need to take a little break here do you ever feel like that I think perception definitely perceives reality you know what looks like so much isn't always so much because you have a schedule and you know within that schedule there's the things that mean the most that come in act is downtime you know me in my house is downtime even though it's still active and I gotta be dead and I'm with the kids and a wife in this conversation and I'm running around and I'm back for that still exes downtime for me like I'm shutting a work off so the phone is any office I'm not going back to get it until the morning and it's all conversation it's all TV it's all Taco Tuesdays it's couch and cuddling you know baby time whatever that's my downtime because I'm taking a step outside of the other [ __ ] that's wise that's that's what I think I do very well I can step outside the other [ __ ] I can separate it so I think when you're able to do that then you're you're managing your mental you don't mean like if it's if it's always one thing all the time that's how you [ __ ] drive yourself crazy cuz you never you're never shutting it off yeah and I think I do a good job of shutting shutting this off and focusing on this like when I want my family I'm with my family nothing is nothing interjects or comes in between that's fantastic that's so important it's understand that's beautiful I doubt that's gigantic I think I figured it out that's it you mean you've got so much success it's all you have to be with that [ __ ] phone all the time that's that that's the phone is the big one right well phone the phone is is the gift and the curse mm-hmm you know I think that we we shout out the gate and saw the gift oh my god it's it's it's community is connecting us we're able to share we're able to meet new people we're able to stay in communication with with all people find new people as entertainer I can engage with my fans and this is so dope and then after that you get hit with the the curse and the curses there's a there's a high level of negativity that's out there that's on that [ __ ] you know there's there's a lot of people that are you know not happy or going through things and they interject a certain amount of negativity and hatred through these devices these devices are the easiest way to touch everybody so when you're just consumed on that [ __ ] all day you start to see yourself being a part of the negative [ __ ] yeah so what I've learned to do is go I don't I don't need to see that I don't need to see that [ __ ] I don't I don't pay that any mind I don't read that [ __ ] for what it's not it's not helping me it's not making me better it's not it's not pushing me to new limits if anything is taken up just creative space by me literally spending time going and navigating through what I think is is a bunch of [ __ ] you know so I don't let the device beat me and at one point I definitely did at one point it was everything there was everything you know now I separate it I'm not embrace clear of it what when you realize what it is when you see when you see the bad you know when you see the bad side of it I thought the other day this is some real [ __ ] and it really made me think my phone died my phone died and I'm driving and I was using the [ __ ] maps and I said [ __ ] what the [ __ ] am I get to with I don't know where I'm going I said I was like you know how did we how did we get from point A to point B before the map [ __ ] what were we doing that I used to print out directions from Google Maps I remember that but then before that how did you get to the places where you were going that you didn't know how to get to I don't even remember remember Thomas guys do you remember Thomas Scott I did have a Thomas guy when I first moved to LA I did have a Thomas guy and I know look a hundred percent bill burr had one two a three years ago but it really [ __ ] me up because I was like how do we don't even know how how to do the common yeah the the the norm anymore because the device has made everything available and I literally had to to drive to store rocket buy a charger charge up my phone to get back and use the map to get to where the [ __ ] I was going I had no idea how to get there I had no I didn't know no numbers by heart I didn't know who I was gonna call oh my god this is the moment where I was like what level of success have I reach I just pulled over and I said here and I was like how the [ __ ] am I gonna get the widow's bear phone man I don't know what it were a backup phone it felt like the end of the world if it felt like it was over house like [ __ ] and that crazy I dependent you are but that's when the light bulb started to click yeah it started to click like how how do we function without I want to go backwards a little bit yeah it's still there I still need it I still think it's dope with all of the things that we can do want it but I still want to be able to put it down and step away from it my kids to be able to step away from it that's why when I come in the house my phone is up cuz I can't I can't [ __ ] and get playing it's all about being on your phone if you see me doing the same thing right right so that time those conversations me wanting to know about your day you talking to me about your day your friends who you like who don't you like my daughter you what boy who what no ok my son yeah I like somebody who oh jesus here it comes it's a great thing and I want to be able to have those moments and you know I think it's it's it's big to make sure that you prioritize that are you worried about what comes next hundred percent I'm worried that something's gonna be way more intrusive than that it'sit's what do you mean it's already happening yeah the biggest scare happened already with the the the FaceTime [ __ ] that happened where whatever whoa Apple on the iPhones it was like people could listen in to your oh yeah if you didn't need to pick up the FaceTime you could just yeah and you know that was the scariest [ __ ] ever because it's if it's that easy to have a bug like that what's the thing that's not a bug that's there that you just don't know about oh there's definitely government listen to us well hunter is it yeah 100 everything everybody says and then in case one day you do something wrong they go by your side mr. Hart we'd like you to sit down from NYU something hundred percent yeah so the fear is the next level of them are intrusive you know I think everything has become intrusive now like the toughest thing for me is that there is no there is no privacy outside my home right you know the the amount of money that you have to now spend just on security on you know people to to be with me security to be on my home you know it's like they're there literally is no privacy and it's not a bit you complain about it because without the fans without the people that support me I wouldn't be where I am but there's no middle ground right you know there is no handshakes anymore it's it's how you doing right right right yeah a handshake is so much better right I get a moment like I'm we can talk if that's what you no no yo say it now weird cuz you you're doing this to me it's kind of weird to have a conversation so you're just starting to see yourself become a little older and wiser and uh just really see the times for what they are and see the direction that we're going in this people and just hope and pray that we find a middle ground because I think right now that is it one yeah that's what I'm feeling now no I feel it too and I especially I mean what you're talking about is you being super famous and losing all your privacy but everyone's losing their privacy yes slowly but surely it's it's happening to you because you're very famous and because you do something that's in the public eye and people want to see you and they want to stick that camera in front of you but there's gonna come a point in time where what we're dealing with now which is like you have to turn your phone on you have to you know you have to reach out to somebody you have to put something up that's that steps gonna be out of the way who's gonna be people being able to act that's your life yeah pretty you know you know the bad here's what I said it's bad that really [ __ ] with me I don't like that negativity is the the want you know like like the the thing that's popular is the failure the the [ __ ] up you know the the fight that I can catch you know the hateful moment that I can catch and post like the bad is being highlighted and celebrated that's what [ __ ] with me what the social media [ __ ] now what really bothers me is you know when you see these things online like you know a fight and there's a man hitting a woman and it's captured right that's bad the bad thing is that you watched that the the video was more important than the actual help right or the moment to step in and you know when you see these things where you're catching people do these things to kids and it's caught the moment of what you got and what you want to post and get likes or whatever on is the focus instead of the help yeah and that's that's the part that is just I just have a hard time processing I have a hard time processing what the likes mean to certain people well you get an extraordinary amount of attention so it doesn't mean anything to you anyway it means something to a regular person but you a regular person if they can catch some worldstar video and put it up they're like dude that's my video that's my video look my video got 5 million hits yeah my video has gone viral my videos everywhere for them it's like it's a point of excitement that's why when they see you look oh [ __ ] how often are they gonna run into Kevin Hart at you know Costco or wherever the [ __ ] you were definitely running right it to me on uh you know I'm in a I'm in a bathroom restaurant and I go to the bathroom you know by the way that I went to the bathroom you could definitely tell I had to [ __ ] I was I was moving fast I was he knows one of those abrupt you know why you eatin yeah I'm eating bad so I didn't eat bad in a while my stomach immediately said that's not gonna happen today I get up and I go and literally like like three seconds I hear it as I'm walking or they go keV hard and as I'm walking by a guy gets up follows me in the bathroom he's like yo I gotta get a picture man and I said let me let me go to the bathroom when I'm done I'll take a picture with you I go to the bathroom this is a true story hannah bible hand on the Bible I assume the guys outside the bathroom cuz I as I'm going I see him and I say what I say I get done I go to the snake wash my hand he was just sitting behind a wall and he's like got his phone out I'm like he probably did he just take me while I was [ __ ] dude put the phone over the thing like I'm about to be on oh my god it's over this is it this is my nightmare here we go they're about to put something up of me shittin is the bottom of my feet it's whatever yeah but he just waited and in that moment was so it was so important that he was in the bathroom and soon as I got a call on the second I said let's go outside the bathroom yeah let's take a picture it's a bathroom I said might am I going to I'm a nice guy man I'm gonna take the picture cuz I just don't want to lose you and I'm like there's not even a thought it's not even a thought about it's a bad price how weird is that Sebastin minutes this is a this is a pretty [ __ ] weird moment man this is weird Halloween you will be the finish [ __ ] no no what you got on your phone right you're too big for me to ask to go through your phone or whatever you got you got but I had to go out and take the picture and I remember going back to the table just like what's happening that's not strange at this point what is happening yeah that didn't exist before I think if you were famous before people just wanted to get an autograph or shake your hand what Pat what passed an autograph stage was last time you get an autograph it's been a while I don't write it I was I think I would know what to put that it's been a minute man yeah and I don't want to make this very clear you know it's not I don't I don't know you know I understand like once again I want people to more importantly understand the fact that I welcome it yeah I welcome the moment that I can talk in and converse with the fame but it should be that like it's normal people the moments are better when they're real you know and after a real moment you you get a picture because you're like yo he was actually a nice guy or I know I did it that you would be this calm and cool you don't even get to see how genuine of a person I am because the first thing you do you you you stick the camera in the face you and that's when people think that you're an [ __ ] because they they they they have the intrusive moment that then gets met with the can you keep please I'm sorry you're not the you look at my face you're gonna be like that they look for that now you get your moment yeah you you look for the negative moment when does it start getting weird for you but how many years in um I know it's been it's been pretty crazy I've been pretty crazy for like the last four to five the last four to five years and the last three you know if it's gotten insane because now you know you're you're on an international level its global and the following is is bigger and it's all ages which is which is really really good but I think you know for comedians it's a different thing because you feel like you know comedians you know you're laughing we're in your homes everything is met with warmth so when you see a comedian especially if you're a fan of a comedian you're associating everything with funny and you're just looking for the funny moment right you're you're looking past a normal moment you know it's like you you almost are frowned upon if you're normal if you just chill right right right because everybody wants the funny moment right they thought you were gonna be funny like I'm supposed to I suppose a pop lock right on the site you know yeah if it's 2:00 in the morning and you run into me and I say hey how you doing man that's not enough when work out your [ __ ] now mm-hmm I've seen you at the Comedy Store but only once where do you work out your [ __ ] I like to go to random comedy clubs you know I think I'll go to New York first New York has always been a home when it comes to building putting some structure within a set that you trying to figure out once I got a skeleton of what I want to do I'll just go to West Palm I love that comedy club The Improv down there and all the place is great I'll stay for two weeks Oh real and just go and run through some jokes I'll go to Utah I'll go to Denver who do two wise guys yeah yeah yeah I'll go to comedy clubs just random comedy clubs that you wouldn't expect to see me at but I'll do a hell of a run and the goal is to get out of there with just a foundation not to have a complete set I just want to get a foundation so when I'm done getting the foundation then I'll do a little comedy club run I'll do a full comedy club run where I'll just put two or three months in and it's comedy club comedy club comedy club and I'm doing seven shows a weekend and people are shocked that I'm there and then I'm doing it but you know that's my that's my gym that's how I work and I end up leaving that period of time with a complete set after the first three or four months that I spent now after that comedy club three or four months on that run then I take it to like a small theater I see what my laughter feels like in a small theater and I do a little run in small theaters and then when I finally feel like it's at a point where I'm getting the the laughs consistently and the punchlines are working and I flipped it back frontwards forward every direction and my story is a real roller coaster and it has an ending where I feel like we get off the roller coaster and we're happy and you don't feel like you were there for an hour mmm is then when I go test it out in every nough and if the arena if the last er sounds the way it's supposed to then I say okay I'm ready if it doesn't then I'll go back to small theaters and then I'll go to an arena again so not to that arena sounds the way it's supposed to do I say I'm going on tour so sometimes it takes me about a year a year and three months here in four months you know people don't say how hard it is to develop our of stand-up material people act like you just turn on a new hour it's it's an hour to get to an hour you're going through four to five hours of [ __ ] that you thought was funny yeah to come up to that hour that you finally say this is gonna be the representation of me this year yeah it's a lot for me to do that especially at this level you know well especially while you're always doing movies and you're always busy with a bunch of other stuff to stuff yourself yeah you don't take any breaks white or I actually you know when I'm touring if there's a movie I make the movie schedule around the torso my shooting days will go Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday rap Thursday maybe ever show Thursday night and then I'm going Thursday Friday Saturday sometimes no show Sunday sometimes show Sunday depending on what the work schedule and the workload for the following week would look like so I'm implementing that in so when I say I'm out I'm out I'm gone yeah so I've knocked that movie out in two months and then when I'm not that tour schedule shifts so the Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday dedicated the family dedicated to an office everything then those weekends are torn but that's all last for a year and a half I mean this year we did 157 shows on my irresponsible tour Wow 157 show before you decided to put it on the Netflix special yeah we did the Netflix the taping I think I did it three weeks before we were done so we probably had 143 shows oh wow then I taped it and finish the tour did you always have this kind of structure like when did you how did you design this thought-out individual yeah I mean thought-out individual it's not random no everything is planned if you look at all my stand-up specials there's a two-year gap in between them so the two-year gap is because at the end of that second year my new special should be coming out when a new special should be coming out I'm now focusing on what the next special is going to be so that first year is all development like right now I'm off I'm not touring but now I'm mentally in the gym and throwing all the old stuff that I talked about a way that's now thrown out can't repeat it can't say it now it's talking about what the new version of myself is going to be what do I want the conversation to be and what's my thinking and just taking notes so eventually now I'm gonna start just popping up a random comedy clubs and trying to figure out what the next thing is so by mid mid 20 I'm probably doing comedy clubs by the end of 20 I have a full fledge concept of that new hour and by the beginning of 21 I should be ready to go out with my new hour hmm end of 21 film my new our mid 22 that hour will come out that seems like a schedule a lot of people are doing now the 2-year schedule it's a perfect get yeah that's hard dude I know louis c.k did a year every year and George Carlin did every year but I think even he said really wasn't the right way that's tough a year stuff yeah I mean that's a that's a shout-out to those that can't do it I think that's amazing [Music] I think just for everything that I have going on and all of the different things that my hands are in within the brand the business I need to make sure that I'm giving a hundred percent change those things so they have the highest opportunity to be successful right if I'm trying to cheat it then it's gonna show you know it's not gonna come out to the best of my ability and with that stand up you got a you got a [ __ ] magnifying glass on you you know you're always being judged off of what you did at one point just like a musician you're always judged off of the album that everybody thought was whatever so the biggest thing for an entertainer artists whatever your craft is is creation how you recreating yourself how are you constantly showing that you're growing for me the only way to do that is to talk about my life and the things that grow along with me the only thing that grows along with me my experiences my family my marriage my mistakes my UPS my downs those are the things that I can talk about further because as you get older things change it gets different it's all coming from my personal opinion of me my view on me and how I see Life you can't lose material in that state mmm that's why I stay away from certain things because those things can become boring after a while for me because I don't have the knowledge of everything that I should like what well politics I don't know joke in the politics I don't I don't joke and anything that has to do with the slander of others or other communities I don't do anything divisive good for you that's my that's my biggest thing and you know this past year was was one that got a little weird because I was like you know I've really dedicated myself to breaking people together like I'm I know that was my my goal that's my priority I damn sure thought that's what I was doing on a global scale everybody all races shapes sizes whoever you are whatever you are you can come to a Kevin Hart show I have a good time so when it came off as if I was a person that was divisive that was tough you talking about the Oscar Oscar [ __ ] yeah this is a time where people are just looking to be upset about things a hundred they're they're not looking to looking at you Kevin Hart as just a human being like what who is he who overall super positive they're not even concentrating on that I mean think about how positive you are and yet they tried to concentrate on some jokes that you did what nine years ago it was a it's a it's a wake up call of understanding the times but it more importantly you know for me it was okay I went through it I made sure that the people of the LGBTQ community really understand it hey guys I apologized before but I'm apologizing again I'm sorry I'm not that guy I don't want you to think I'm that guy then it just became the constant conversation there never happened that it just became the constant conversation and and now it is guys I'm not only sorry I don't condone anything that has to do with hate to anybody this is no longer conversation so guys I'm gonna stop talking about it because now I feel like I'm feeding into yes what not I I know I'm not the world and public should understand and know them not because over this time period I've shown that I'm not so the apology once again I'm sorry genuinely I'm sorry but then it just kept it just it never stopped and at that point I just made a decision and I'm like guys at this point I just I'm making a decision to not talk about it anymore that doesn't mean that I'm being disrespectful to anybody that doesn't mean as I'm shutting down anything it means that for me I'm gonna stop talking about it because at this point I don't know what to do at this point I thought I thought the apology is what you wanted me to do I did it I made sure did you understand that I'm not a hateful person at Noga don't hate I did that I stepped down so I don't take attention off of that night knows people that are there to be celebrated I don't want to draw attention to myself and what's around me I step down everything I did was for the better of good I'm stepping away guys because I don't want this to be a negative night or a negative thing and then it still became a conversation so I waited for it to die down I went on my radio show gave another public apology make sure doesn't he understand it I'm sorry I hope these words didn't hurt anybody I once again apologized I don't condone hate to anyone I hope that you guys can forgive me for those jokes of oh so now I say if you don't understand it you don't believe it I don't know what else to give I don't know what else to do there's nothing else you can do that's very wise of you nothing it's very wise easy to step away like that because if you didn't they would probably pursue it forever but I mean it's it becomes a point of attention that's all it is it's decided that this is something they're gonna focus on what I had a I had a good talk and I'm gonna talk about this for a minute friend of mine Lee Daniels you know man Lee Daniels Lee called me told me where to talk to you know Lee Daniels is director producer the show empire's his biggest shows you know so he calls me he's like everyone talk to you and and I was talking he's like look this is a time where you could speak up and talk about you know the community that's been affected by hatred and you know hateful crimes you can step up and be a voice and say that you don't condone or don't stand with any type of hate or whatever you can take that stage and do that and I said Lee I said that's I understand what you're saying I said well why did you expect me to know what's been happening with in this community in regards to hate and crimes I said I I'm not aware I said some people can just not be aware I'm not even no I have no idea what's going on I have no idea yes within that community I have no idea right when you tell me this I'm now educated and I understand so it's easy to simply inform right information is key when people get information they process the information when you can process the information you go oh wait a minute that makes sense hey if you guys think that I can don't hate wait a minute I don't and anybody that does [ __ ] you man that's bad you shouldn't I can say that but instead when this happened it was become an ally mmm become a voice you know and that's that's where there was just a miscommunication that's where a back and forth kind of was established that I think people just started to take things and run with it and I'm just not I'm just not one to feed into what I feel isn't going to eventually evolve into a positive thing in a real conversation yes yeah when I'm trying my best to it was becoming tabloid [ __ ] as opposed to like a real discussion click me yeah click click me that's the problem there's so much bait out there because it's such an effective way to get people to pay attention to things because as you said people focus on failure and negative and anger that's what we want to see controversy that's what we want to see people don't want to see the anger yeah and and you know we think that is because it's just the times it's it's that's what's cool now always being negative you know how you always have some people it's a great example how you have people mean you can talk about a movie all right we can talk about Titanic wow it's authentic one of the biggest movies of all time [ __ ] great movie yes it was great movie and why guy for no reason go I [ __ ] hated it yeah why yeah like Titanic [ __ ] [ __ ] why manga yeah I know what tell me why'd you hate it I got time talk about that the cool thing is just being different I wanna I wanna be completely opposite Denali Contreras how the people you know what no no that [ __ ] was ass what Wow Wow why was it ass we have people that just like to do this oh yeah for sure and and and what happens when one person does it another person for no reason all go yeah me too yeah she was ask man i hain't like it either did you see it what y'all talkin about you don't even know what they're talking about but you just want to hop on the negative train right because that's what's cool it's not cool to be positive it's not cool to be happy I don't know if it's a cool thing I think it's usually people that are really frustrated with their lives 100% what's the that's the factual side to it I did a joke before was like do you think Michael Jordan leaves YouTube comments like people want to get mad and complain constantly about [ __ ] like that do you know what it takes to do this right here you know right here no tell you how I feel write in your comments section Joe Rogan you can kiss my you know what that takes what do you have going that you have the time to just simply be that negative and do it in this world you know someone's just a mismanagement of your time yeah it is so valuable and I don't think people understand how valuable they can be if they use their time correctly yes now have you always been like this always be sausages oh my [ __ ] god man but always always really I find a light in every dark tunnel I will find a goddamn light man I hear at all you listen when I tell you to wait on my back it's so heavy of all the stuff that I deal with and I'm fine the reason why I'm fine is because I'm genuinely happy I'm happy and I'm not happy just because of the success success X is a bonus I'm happy because I truly know the definition and the feeling that comes with happiness I truly know it I felt it I felt it when I said yo what really makes me happy and I look at heaven and Hendrix and I look his oh I look at my wife I go yo I didn't have the family [ __ ] when I was coming up yeah I got one I got one look what I did look what I built these people depend on me I provide these people that makes me happy that makes me happy when my daughter comes up dad you're not only my dad you're my best friend no I'm happy that's my world so everything else from the outside that comes in your your your throwing [ __ ] at a at a at a bubble that can't be popped mmm it's a force field around me yeah there's a force field around me because what matters what really matters loves me wholeheartedly and when you had that and you understand that you're unbreakable so if you don't add to that force field if you don't make my force field stronger you don't you don't you don't get time for me my team heartbeat productions the people underneath my umbrella you're part of my force field you what I believe we all see the same things we want the same things so we march with the same beat you can't you can't shake that when you're an individual that seen that and understands that if you've never felt that if you have no idea what that feels like then it's easy to shake you that's why some people are easily broken being broken is not a hard thing it's not a hard thing so those that do get broken those that do get down those that do get depressed I understand I understand I don't I don't knock people for it mmm I don't not anybody for it what I also understand is that the encouragement that can come from so many can add value for those that may need a little push hmm that may need a little Amen pick your chin up it's so easy to be that positive reinforcement for somebody and add value it's so easy but some people choose to throw that aside and kick while you're down mmm I try to put out the light of positivity because whoever is out there you I don't know what it could do for somebody else but somebody else may just simply look at me say you know the way to he embraces his kids it makes me want to be a better father yo way to this man doesn't stop and await it every day he wakes up and he's just positive regardless of what's going on makes me realize that this [ __ ] ain't so bad the way that he gets up and says hey today is another day it's the morning let's all be better than we were yesterday somebody probably needed to hear that the more that I can give that out and I can take my platform to throw good energy out I'm doing my part because there's so many that thought the complete opposite yeah I don't want to be a part of that that's beautiful man that's and that's true I believe you it's not it's not forced right it's not phony yeah it's not fake this [ __ ] every day I hear [ __ ] every day it's very contagious too I had a lady I heard a lady right [Laughter] lady rolled out a window when you gonna make a good movie again did you see the upside was good what's that oh [ __ ] it's a movie it's one of my movies that's how us think I think it's a good movie I see that all right ma'am you have a beautiful day that's with such conviction like literally yeah I could have said a lot of [ __ ] like she rolled a window down you could tell she still had the crank things that I could say to you ma'am when you gonna make a good movie it's napping I got one out the upside you see the outside what's that oh it's a movie so it's out now amazing it that's how she chose to come out here I see it I'm Jesus to come at you with a negative I get it every day when you'll be funny again trying my best but trying my best if it's not working for you hopefully I do better soon what do you what what am I gonna feed into that and add water right why why for what yeah for what it seems to have been working thus far are you getting this positive attitude towards life from life experience are you getting it from books did someone teach you how to find this I'm getting it from the experiences and from the the real understanding of perfection doesn't exist don't exist Oh mmm we're in a time right now where people expect perfection you expect perfection I don't know where dust came from I don't know what happened that this is the criteria for living my true understanding is all right you got one life and then one life the goal for us is to live it to the best of our ability from the beginning so what said the end in the middle in the beginning middle you're gonna do things you're gonna make mistakes you're gonna [ __ ] up you're supposed to learn and then move forward with the understanding of what not to do and when you move forward life may get better it may not but somewhere along the lines is gonna click and everything that I went through back here was supposed to happen so that now that I'm here I'm able to go ahead with such a high level of knowledge and I can make other people better I can make myself better I could do more for my family something happens my dad is the prime example crazy drug addict in and out of jail life was very bad very [ __ ] bad my dad son got successful son then took money gave it to his dad here's your house here's your truck here's your monthly at this age I want you to live your life you know made mistakes you can't rebuild and correct the things you've done I'm your son I love you you can't go back in and redo you can't try to keep going backwards ain't about me you got grandkids mmm gonna be the best grand pop you could be for these grandkids that's your focus now where's this energy devoted to being a grand pop for the grandkids don't worry about me but something happened in your life something happened that took you in the direction to reap the benefits of your son's happiness and success my energy is now contagious nothing I hand it to you so now you're able to give that off to all these other people that you're around something happens and that's in every single life in every life I understand that there's a payoff for bad eventually there's a payoff it can't be bad but for so long if you got the strength and the understanding to realize that [ __ ] will change it will change it's impossible just like poker I don't know if you play poker or not I don't you play poker you can run bad forever but it will eventually turn around once you grasp the understanding of the game eventually it's gonna turn around blackjack you're never gonna be the casino but eventually you're gonna have a good run if you catch you run you'll do good get the [ __ ] out of there you waited long enough for it to happen here come catch it leave anything in life will eventually turn good no but this is coming just from your own personal experience have any role models that I'm up to you this way Nancy art did she speak to you like this about positivity and about my mom reinforced knowledge my mom reinforced you don't start things and not finish them you don't quit there's nothing that comes out of quitting besides knowing that you didn't finish we finish everything you started finish it if you're gonna do it do it to try and be the best not be better than other people be the best for you if you're in school and you're going to class I'm not asking you to get straight A's I'm asking you to get the best grade that you can possibly get give me a hundred percent all the time and I'm a happy mother when you half-ass me I'm on yes mom I want to do this I wanna I want to play baseball well then you gonna play my mom like that no more then why'd you start the season because I thought I wanted to do it then you gonna finish the season you don't quit there's other people that invested time and energy into you you don't just quit on people but I don't want to do it finish the season mom I want to swim then you gonna finish swim it didn't matter what I did I was never allowed to quit so now in anything I do when I pick it up a say i'ma start it I got to finish it it all don't work it all ate the best hmm it all ain't knocked out the park but I walk away saying I finished it I did it I did it right now I've been boxing I saw I saw you working out with Rico Verhoeven I'm [ __ ] first of all very strong kicker huge man okay he's a big guy too man good guy but I started in jeans I started it and I said why am I doing this I'm not gonna be a professional fighter I'm not trying to be a amateur fighter I'm doing the guiness shape alright then I start getting shaped I said you know so much that I don't know about the sport I at least want to make sure that I'm paying homage to the people that do this for a living by really understanding and learning it you know what I'm gonna get a real trainer I'm getting some real people to show me everything so when it's all said and done and I look back after my training I can go I gave it 100% and look at how good I got look at what I'm a product of a spar I go getting really yeah yeah just to feel it so I can say it you know well sparse Bryan Callen is this serious no it's me yeah that's me come on that's me dude that's me it's getting it to look at this who is teaching him uh his name is Biggs he's in Atlanta that's me learn I had a turtle shell within punches but you know he's a former Golden Glove guy really good to you were in a cup and everything when I was at the sparring session when I'm I grow tired damn yeah I got touched I got my ass whipped and every couple times I go guys worried about that all good I don't go crazy we had gear and but I'm not in there with guys that are trying to hurt yes I'm not in there was touching guys that have no concept of reality yeah or control like they're they're just helping me understand right here's why you have to keep yeah that is a problem with celebrities trying to spar like if you try to like you know that's why Mickey Rourke started getting all that facial surgery I'm serious he's part of James Toney Jesus lashes she's not a smart right here that's James Tony's a mean man and it's just not you can't like I don't I don't go in that space have you ever seen James Tony talk [ __ ] boys bars and there's some of the most entertaining thing you'll ever find on YouTube he's just he just won't shut the [ __ ] up beating your ass he's talking [ __ ] that's that's [ __ ] [ __ ] that's her and he's one of the best defensive fighters ever so he's really difficult to hit he's got that smells fresh and a in the world yeah I had a guy who's got any Mikey I'm sparring with Mikey Mikey hit me with three punches I thought I thought Mikey literally had like six arms this is the true story this I said I don't know what just happened but I thought I had my hands up in no matter where I put him he just tapped me he lets me feel it but not to where I might getting knocked out but I understand now movement I understand pivots I understand shoulder protection and that's my goal my goal is just understand cuz I can't do anything halfway okay if you try to fight somebody nope right nope I just want to say that I did it and I learn and I can move and I look the part cuz I put time into it well as you learn it too as you watch and you start get trained then you start to look at a guy like Terence Crawford or lumen Co and you go oh now I appreciate what you're doing because before you'd see like oh yeah I beat that guy up oh yeah he knocked that guy out but then you see like how he ducks under the left and fires back with the right you know Jesus this is precision it's insane yeah the the respect that I have for people that do that on a day to day is through the roof yeah and people that fight are in the most amazing shape in the universe yeah you're in the most amazing shape ever to move get hit for three to five minutes around come back do it come back do it and these fights go on and on and on I take my hat off to you yeah you get three rounds out of me I'm breathing out my butt I don't know where the air is coming from I'm searching for it it's a crazy way to make a living to money in your brain thank God I don't I didn't have to go down that route and you know to those that do just make sure you just put your body first like you said it's a it's hurtful when you see the damage that it can call us yeah we were talking about that earlier like seeing guys as they start to deteriorate and it's hard because nobody wants to tell him that either every I want to tell them they got one more good fighting them and let's uh maybe at the end of the year then we'll decide but right now we're gonna train hard and my stuff it's hard to cuz there's no option so they don't once you've established yourself as a professional fighter and you don't have an exit strategy you don't know what to do you know now at least thankfully because of the internet guys are getting podcasts and they're starting doing commentary shows they're talking about fighting and it's the positive you just found the positive that's the positive within the internet that is positive you just don't you just don't hear it celebrate it as much well the Internet's very positive for me I mean this is the show we do on the Internet I mean all not just podcast but YouTube videos and also information I know more because of the internet than I ever would have without it there's not a not doubt in my mind a more educated more aware person I want just the Internet yeah you get the things that you're able to find and search and I mean like you said you're you're able to self-educate yeah at a very high level these are the goods yeah we're talking about the goods so when you talk about positive Kevin how have you been yeah are you always like that it's this it's the things that I look at that are so easy you're not just positive though you're look crazy ambitious that's the thing that gets me about you in the rock for sure it's like the ambitions off the charts like I know your riches [ __ ] like when when do you think you got enough you don't have enough there's no doesn't know enough I don't have enough because it's not over it's all over it's not over so you know when when you put a cap on it you're putting a punctuation to it mm-hmm and the the the ambition comes from seeing what's out there that can be obtained you know when you see what's out there like what can you mean physical things like well you see what's out there when you see where people are really gaining wealth and knowledge from okay the business relationships that you're able to acquire the people that you're able to partner with and create certain things different revenue streams what I found is as a young black guy from North Philadelphia the biggest problem with the biggest problem within our community is knowledge we don't know debt debt is welcomed because it's celebrated that's all we know and I'm get that credit card oh my [ __ ] that credit card up and it is what it is they gotta figure that out I ain't got it after that yeah well you know what I'm getting student loans they gave it to me then after that [ __ ] is I'm figured out I put a cable bill in your name you put it in my name we can switch it up whatever they do it there let's just put it in someone else name its welcome the Hustle is welcome the knowledge of banks and what you can do it can't do is it's [ __ ] you don't even get it cuz you go to check cashing places reason like go check cash place because I don't want go through that ship the banks I'll trust that go right there to check heads please let me get mine let me get mine now take $30 whatever let me get it the knowledge is given so it's not to you obtain that knowledge and understanding that you go oh [ __ ] oh this is why you put money up oh this is this is how you increase versus decrease oh this is how you earn on your money oh wow I can gain wealth by investing in what the stock world is what how many people partake in a stock world and is there a part that isn't necessarily gambling is there a low-risk part these that's not the information isn't there so it's not so I got to a certain level and a certain group of people where I got it and now that I got it I want to give it so now I'm going to give it I'm gonna give it to the people that I know need it most and for me that younger generation of black people that don't understand the cool thing is in financial longevity not in a now it's not in the moment for jewelry not in the moment for the car it's in the longevity it's in building so at the end of the day you can say look at what I have look at what I worked for look at what I have that's mine monopoly is real but you have to have the financial understanding and I teamed up I got chased I never done something called financial fitness where's just about me educating people on money how to manage money how to how to be smart with your money but it's coming from a person that [ __ ] that money I didn't always understand it I hold in taxes before because I didn't understand it in the beginning I've had bad credit credit cards wouldn't take me because I maxed out whatever I've been there I've done it thank God I was able to fix it and get on the right path and now that I have the knowledge I want to give it could simply don't know so when you say the end game the end game is getting to a point where I've taken all the knowledge that I've been able to get over these years and really applying it and providing family wealth when it's all said and done the last-named heart is gonna mean just more a lot more than just Kevin Hart and comedy heart beat production it's got heartbeat digital your heartbeat ventures your heartbeat real estate there's so many things that the last-named heart will be attached to you real estate Kevin Hardin sell real estate a Bible stand by it but the reason why is because investment investment but but as you get older you learn this you learn it and and you know it's such a thing where you talk about black versus white you know a lot of people do that and and I flee so like there is racism racism exists I'm not unaware of that but there is a high volume of it that's that's non-existent people had a good people and when you can merge yourself with good people and follow the paths that you see that these good successful people have taken you then become a part of a world and group that nobody expected you to be it so for me I now have the position to do that and take all of these relationships and all this knowledge and take it back to the people that need it most I like to share I don't want it all by myself now are you doing this and the financial stuff you're doing this in videos you like releasing videos no we're gonna start we're gonna start financial fitness like I said with chase JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon very good guy to Shanda is well they're there helped leading in charge of saying how can we get to the people that we feel need the financial information of most so I said put me out there like let's let's go directly to the consumer so from colleges from high schools senior classes junior classes going out and talking to people before they go into the next stages of their life a lot of things that you should know so you're gonna speak to them and just share personal information are you gonna put this stuff online as well yeah yeah you'll be able to track and find content from it but I'm authentic so I said the best way to really do it is to put me in a position to be heard right I want to be heard like like it's a different story what I explained to the the people of JPMorgan Chase just when we were talking about this and as an amazing board of people that are just figuring this out and the best way to go and do it and I said you can't have the white guy that's never been to the hood or who's not from the hood or has no idea how the economy works here and what the real troubles are you can't throw that man in the situation to talk to people because I'm not listening to you from the gate because you don't relate I don't relate to you but throwing somebody in a situation that's lived it that's been in it that's been [ __ ] up in it made it out of it and is now coming back to help run it's a different ballgame and that's what I want to be and you know we have other voices outside of myself very powerful voices that are going to do it as well but the purpose is to align ourselves to really make a change so you can either be the conversation about making change you can be actual a part of the action to do it I want to be a part of the action and in doing it you'll also be able to understand my drive you'll get why I do so much you'll get why my hand is in so much because I have access to it and the question should be why not yeah the question shouldn't be yo why is he doing everything he should be why aren't you why aren't you trying to do everything why not well that's the thing about a guy like you that becomes contagious like what you were saying about surrounding yourself with positive people and people that are constantly ambitious and that that there's fuel to that you feel good about that that's what you're doing I can I can say seeing you here right we walked around you show me a facility loved it beautiful facility you talk to me about how your podcast is grown to where you are now the success behind it I don't leave here and go yo that's dope of [ __ ] I go hey I need to do more work on my radio station laugh out loud radio I own it it's mine I got a show on there but you know a Joe [ __ ] motivated me to do more I want to make sure that we understand really what's out here within his radio world because I just saw my guy in his space and I saw happy he is what success he has I don't want to be you or beat you I want to take this energy and apply it to myself that's the purpose of seeing yeah that's the purpose of being smart with your eyeballs you should be a sponge so I'm a sponge so I come here and I look at how you maneuver I look at your setup I not only bow down and congratulate you I leave and I said yo man I'm inspired dude that's dope as hell John can't wait in two years you gonna call me you gonna see my [ __ ] you remember I said I was inspired but you're gonna see what I let it grow into that's the proper way to get encouraged in motivating right as opposed to being a hater a hater and in competitive yeah i'ma beat you it's not a competition yeah I'm not interested in that either and I share the exact same feelings it's not a competition at all yeah so if you don't have people like that that are inspiring around you you might not know how positive it is and how it how powerful it is if you see someone that's on television or on social media and you see them it's hard to be inspired you don't know them but you're I can say look at your circle right and in your circle if the conversation is all about what we hate I can't stay in that song you see the new [ __ ] car came out okay this [ __ ] is ass I can't stand that [ __ ] car yo man I can't stay in this city what [ __ ] we even in the city what we eatin I hate that place it's so easy if you people don't even listen to it it's so easy to be the smallest [ __ ] in the world the smaller [ __ ] but if it's always hate can't stand these [ __ ] headphones why we got these headphones ladies like a horrible day why the buzz here [ __ ] that Stan it's hard whatever hate harwood how could you get a private table [ __ ] hate this [ __ ] [ __ ] chairs you're got better chairs I hate these chips it's so easy right so easy it's so easy to talk about yeah yeah and so many people don't realize that in a group you do it you ping-pong hate off on them yeah unless it's funny it can be funny just between yourselves trees yeah Patrice was it was one of the best funny one of the best 20 haters okay okay you bring up a good point comedic hate McConaughey yeah communicate one of the not one of the probably the best Patrice Patrice I remember when I would talk and if I was saying something you just hear what would you tell buddies what what are you talking about you like just the way you talk but what your voice everything about your voice just makes me want to punch you in the face we talking about when he would go after you - it kind of made you feel good - like if you're a comments especially if your comic like I called Opie and Anthony once I was talking them and Anthony anything he always has a gun on him Harry's a gun everywhere like he has a concealed carry permit and [ __ ] and I said to him I said do you ever worry that maybe you're putting out this energy and you're manifesting something like some sort of an attack on you because you're constantly dwelling on it you always have this gun and Patrice goes don't believe in magic don't believe me conjuring up the world he would go after you man it's like you just want to step back and watch I don't know but he got bill burr so Marilyn Oh bill used to get so [ __ ] mad beautiful thing about Bill Barbara would be snap at bill bill is the guy that's not funny where's the punch line in it there's no punch line he was so [ __ ] mad we the Comedy Cellar the days that we had there man bill burr Patrice O'Neal Keith Robinson Jim Norton Colin Quinn myself when I say we would sit at this table we would set this table for four to five hours and it would be nothing but beautiful trash ins to one another when I say they used to give me so much [ __ ] that's probably why it's so hard to bother me now the trash ins that I took from the age 20 to 24 and my young comedic career about how awful I was I had a joke I had a joke where to begin into my career cuz at the times let me preface this this was way in the beginning of my career this was a joke that I had about about little people midgets at the time and it's you know it was so bad cause I got robbed by a cross-eyed Mitch and the joke was I didn't know he was robbing me because I was with somebody else so he was looking at my friend but he was robbing me it was like a play on being crisis very very awful joke I remember telling his joke in a phone book comes flying on the stage put trees through a [ __ ] phone book at me I told him this isn't where the Boston comedy club people in a crowd tiny little place all you heard was and you sit back it hits the floor I said and Patrice said read it it's better material in it than what you're saying that crawls does laughs oh he's uh they all might say they used to trash me so bad so bad man do you alleged a retreat some news story a corporate trees jerking off at my house before this is I moved to LA I'm saying the two double partment I just got there Patrice coming out I said yo you need place ass I got two bedrooms you can come near it's my ex-wife at the time you know I come home it's like afternoon like Patrice mi yo you all but tres but race I go out in the bag open up the door I said his big-ass computer oh I see is his back hunched over so baby oil right and I come in on my door he'll get out get out get out [Laughter] he's so sick he's so sick that he didn't stop he was so concerned with finishing then he didn't even break stride and turn around and not really nothing he get out yeah you just saw his back hunched he came out like seven minutes late it was like my bad i may use come home [ __ ] for treatment I love him to death love him to death yeah he had the most don't give a [ __ ] of any time I ever met it was most 100% yeah good and bad yeah you know there yeah there was a good to it and there was also some bad you know a lot of things that didn't have been for Patrese probably could have happened but I think the the level of not give a [ __ ] yeah prevented some of those things well he was almost too authentic yes like his like gypsy that was it Charlie Sheen's roast whose roast was it that he did what he just torture everybody else on the roast and then he got up there and you guys the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] who is this [ __ ] oh my god Patrice has so many of those things yeah so many of things one of one of the best to do it if you if you are listening you're not educated I'm Patrice O'Neal just I ask did you just watch Elvin in the room one of his specials yeah some of that some of the funniest [ __ ] ever man and so insightful mmm-hmm he was so why the way people thought and behaved he would say [ __ ] like one of the things that he said that I I tell people all the time it's a it's a brilliant thing that he said it was forget what controversy it was but he was on television with some woman who was saying that you should never tell jokes about certain things you know and they were they were getting mad at someone I think it was Opie and Anthony about a joke and he said you gotta understand that all jokes come from the same place the ones you like and the ones you don't like the ones that make you laugh and the ones that make you mad they all come from the same place someone's just trying to be funny yeah like sometimes they just don't work I had a talk I had a talk with the I forgot her name I got I forgot her name but it was when I was doing all the promo for upside and they kept trying to break down you know where where where the jokes come from you know Kevin these insensitive jokes in that you told back then why what what makes you why would you even say those things and the hardest thing for me to explain I was like do you think people think of jokes and while thinking of them think that they're not going to be funny everything that you think of in a joke form you're thinking of it because you think you're gonna get a laugh behind it yeah the gamble is if I get the lab versus not get the lab don't get the laughs the joke was not funny if I get a laugh then I guess I'm on to something there isn't a bunch of thought that goes into the funny moments that we think may be great bits yeah I wish that I had a more logical answer to put behind it I said I don't especially at that time my career I just thought it would be funny the same way that some people think sir jokes funny the offer it's a thought comedians are constantly throwing [ __ ] out there yeah you're constantly rolling a dice and Thor [ __ ] out there had to [ __ ] you roll and good right it's not gonna be good the other hatten maybe all right maybe kind of good but it's all with the intent of entertaining it's not with the intent of being malicious it's not with the intent of sparking hatred it's all trying to make you laugh yeah that's it like it's it's literally that simple from a thought within the comedian's mind yeah nothing nothing else they kept trying to look for this like hard definition of why and it's like I don't have it I don't have the reason why I thought it would be funny and it wasn't that's the downfall that's it that's it it's it's and the thing is about this art form is that up until ten fifteen years ago there was never any discussion like this it wasn't so so when we developed and when we were coming up there was no it was just like and there was always guys that would push the envelope way too far I believe Jesus Christ you see his new bid what the [ __ ] yeah and you'd be laughing yeah you tell it to each other and yeah and it didn't matter what it was joke about murder or rape or what some people just use those dark subjects like they're trying to make us laugh yeah in the meetings the comedian's comedian there's always gonna be though well you just innovate you all do you know Brian Holtzman 100% yeah but in Holtzman's that guy 100% my funniest dudes and and and there's no way that I could say no some of the stuff that I heard me say remember Susan Smith that lady who drowned her kids I I know I know who you're talking about her and I know the moment but I'm not familiar with all all that involved Holtzman was on stage that week and he's like I heard those kids were bad I heard they set that close to the TV they never put away their blocks there we spilt their milk those kids will not be missed yeah and you were just like oh I in the [ __ ] like 9/11 when 9/11 happened they wouldn't let him on stage well Mitzi shore would not let him on stage four months after 9/11 she's like no way keep him off the stage I mean do you have you have the people just Sartre did they go for that they go for because they want to hear you howl and get back to the room do you know that like if it's you know comics are there in the back of the room they're gonna laugh their [ __ ] ass off at that chair and and you know it's weird because right now within a times I'm the comedian that chooses to be sensitive to the times you know I've made the choice to say I understand I get why you shouldn't say certain things why you should avoid this that or this I I understand and I am but then there's other comedians that go you know what I'm more staged I'm gonna be me and I'm not gonna do that because people are telling me that this is what I I'm gonna go harder yeah and do that that's yeah that just exists it just exists but I think it's easier to just say I'm not a fan that comedy isn't for me right you know what I don't I don't like the taste of this particular comedian so I'm not going to support a watch that comedian I'm gonna find another comedian there's more to my liking I'm going to go and just turn my head like I want us to get back to just understanding that you just don't have to support it yeah that's it well there's a lot of [ __ ] option it's very I mean there's so many today yeah there's never been more never been more comics I think about how many people were doing Netflix specials so many's never been more it's something so easy so I don't understand why there's a push to destroy which you just don't have to support it like I think it's just a bunch of people that have an ability to influence things now that didn't have an ability before and it's like they see a window and they want to throw a rock it's right there makes sense I think there's something that but I also think mm-hmm for us like meat for me in particular I really like [ __ ] up comedy it's one of my fits like I like Quentin Tarantino movies where people get shot and killed yeah I don't want anybody get shot and killed in real life yeah but I like [ __ ] up comedy yeah do you know Tim Dylan is yes I do pull up that [ __ ] video that him being mega Kane he is a savage dude he goes so hard but I saw this video I was tears rolling down my eyes I was crying and I was like okay this guy's needed we need this right now because during this political correct push you got this big giant gay dude who doesn't give a [ __ ] let me seize an animal watch this [ __ ] and we're going to it will be raised in captivity it'll be raised privately to be the greatest politician that has ever had my name is Megan McCain and I'm on a new show we have you see this to folks that [ __ ] riverboat casino catherine is talking about my father again my father was tortured for a hundred years for this [ __ ] country and he came back and he started seven wars because he's a gentleman [ __ ] you try I'm gonna wear my father's skin mask and I'm gonna primary from the right if you don't know he's wearing lipstick and a dress oh my goodness that's pretty damn that's out there they need that guy we need him it's out there we need guys like that I mean just talking about what we said it's like it's just it's very easy to just to just say you know what that's not me behind what is like for me yes advice humor is different I laugh I laugh there's a rhythm there's a viral video it is this old guy trying to hoverboard he's like [ __ ] he's gotta be like 69 70 and you know his grandkids there and he's like let me let me try it let me try it and this man gets on this hover board and takes if you saw Mike Tyson fall on a hoverboard his fall was worse than Mike Tyson's I've never seen somebody hit their head harder in my life and I didn't laugh out of wanting to see this old man hurt herself I laughed because it was stupid to try to get on his hoverboard in the first place and when he got up he tells the kids why is it moving like this this video everybody because that [ __ ] made me laugh some people were watching oh no no some people were watching to go oh oh oh another one just died [ __ ] laughing because everybody's humor is different yeah humor is different my humor is different falling makes me laugh okay we're you are falling makes me laugh I don't give a [ __ ] who you are if you fall in front of me no shot I'm holding there laughs there's no shot you don't stand a chance if you there's no shot that I'm not bust your ass something something's got to come out right falling is funny I still think it's hacky I still think farts are funny when my kids fart I laugh I still to this day it's the funny [ __ ] every me that goes that V you stick get out of it stay gas my little son 17 months when you fart I laugh something something within just ability to just be [ __ ] silly and GOP oh yeah it doesn't always have to have a meaning behind it some [ __ ] is just stupid my eight-year-old farts on cue she thinks it's hilarious genius she'll tell you that listen I gotta talk to you about something that's laughing she think it's hilarious she'll fall down the couch she can't stop laughing that's all you got it's your only bit as a kid nothing else but farts that's all you got that's all you've got to make people laugh you should enjoy it no he should think it's funny folly but falling is number one for me falling is number one my wife fell down the steps she got so mad cuz I didn't rush to help her I laugh she had a wine glass wine with all over the walls oh my god what are the worst Falls I've ever seen in my damn lap got up her shoe was on one step the shoe was all follow us funny I like it I don't laugh have fallen that much I just deal with too many injuries I've seen too many people get hurt it's not for you yeah especially old dudes fallen down hitting their head on Mike I start thinking about brain trauma and CTE long-term repercussions I'm near I'm right there with you it's probably better I'm right there with you there's the one that's going on today of this dude trying to come up the stairs on this other dude did you see that one the guy stomped them and set him flying like all I could think of is we don't see it in the video but that guy's head it's got to be smithereens oh my god he he had hit his head the way he fell back yeah you ever seen one of the guy who slipped and fell down a bunch of steps at the museum and falls in the water yeah he's going it goes in water Dumbo right you can't you can't beat that there's this dude this goes walking up the stairs and this dude's legs get the [ __ ] off my porch stop leave me alone and he keeps coming he's like don't do it don't do it and he got boom smack the way he fell back you know hands behind him that's all head that's all head first of all to not see that kick coming yeah from a guy that says it's sad but you also have to realize a guy that size is carrying all that weight of a donkey kick yes that's just caved in my got stomped but to not see it once again I always thought that about fat people but if you really really fat imagine how strong your [ __ ] legs must be strongly should ever yeah if you really get some power behind that kick and also if you've lost the weight you'd have these incredible legs that's a that's always a theory just it's Anthony but I was wonder if their needs are gonna shrink it wait what because you see someone from behind they're like 500 pounds like their knees are that wide I'm like okay is that the bone like is that fat around the bone like has the bone grown really wide too cuz your body does your bones do get denser if you do like heavy weight mmm like this if you look at like power lifter dudes they're do they're dense well part of it is not just their frame it's that they're constantly lifting heavy things so your body thickens up did you as you go but you know when when you know people that are larger make the the dedication to actually losing the weight and they stay away from like the weights and stuff and just do cardio it sheds off so fast yeah but he can't like I know I know a couple of friends of mine and lost like 130 140 pounds and like if now just fallen in love with fitness to the point where it's unbelievable like how their body is transformed and taking a liking to the new the new process that they're now in pretty yeah they get addicted instead of food they get addicted to being healthy exactly it's totally possible totally possible I've had I don't know how many people come up to me and said they've lost a hundred pounds plus because of listening to my show and having fitness experts on and diet experts and and just talking about staying the [ __ ] away from sugar say don't eat late at night yes that's eating stop eating in a certain time and give yourself more than enough time to digest Cal your calories start exercising well with me I think the thing with me that helps me so much as I'm not a foodie you're not I'm not a foodie man I'm just not you know it's boring gotta go eat with I'm just making a Turk that's it I'm literally just what is that yeah that's fine let me give that this baked chicken some brown rice that's fine I'm good you don't worry about eating healthy I'm a healthy eater because I'm not a foodie so it's not like it doesn't doesn't matter like I don't have the will or want to eat the bad [ __ ] so if you're passing by in-n-out burger nothing no nothing nah man I'm black fried chicken fried chicken you showed me a process Popeyes Roscoe's is good too but Popeyes really pops with Roscoe's yes man paradise Popeyes is [ __ ] I don't know what I don't

starting my own supplement line vitae hustle love to vitamin that we put out but let me tell you why doe I'm gonna tell you why I'm even getting into this space so when I look at physical fitness and I look at this world I noticed that you know you have a you have a great one in need to look like everything around you that you see like everybody like everybody that's a part of this world they look so [ __ ] great and fit when they're talking about these products and the things they can do and I said you know what what I'm able to do and what I've done in my past I'm always bringing people together of all like in whole like there is nobody's alienated you know when I did my runs with Nike and before I got signed by Nike it was about bringing a bunch of people that never ran before and getting you guys to get up just come run with me just try it and you notice I got people out that never thought they were [ __ ] do it and we doing five miles we don't ten miles whatever it's just a group run something to say we did I said how can I create a product where I'm putting people in a position to understand there's a hustle in all of us that's what my multivitamin is about it's the energy is the recharge it's the ability to focus is to approach your day with all of the tools that you basically need it's not just about the physical fitness aspect it's about the health so if I can actually motivate people to take the step in the right direction of health with a line of supplements that are driven for the everyday individual that may not know or be aware but wants to engage but you're not in it to look like all these different people you're in it to be the best version of yourself how can I do that teamed up with a great group of people to create the best possible products that I want to do and I said I want to be patient so it took me for you four years to create about us and how many different products you go right now just by dose vitae Hustle is my only one right now so it's just a vitamin just a multivitamin but it's an amazing multivitamin is it a single pill or is it a packet but no it's a it's a jar I should have [ __ ] bought one good job a jar Jesus Christ so you like mix it in some stuff no it's a jar full like all pills yes pills okay um I'm gonna tell you the dope stuff this that's in it cuz I don't want to not say anything in and have it to where it's wrong so I always got it up on the screen man good Jesus Christ I get it hey you guys see it yep that's why you here we're gonna save that on my phone blueberry fruit extract scroll scroll back up there boron biotin beta-carotene vitamin A mmm-hmm what's all good [ __ ] it's all good [ __ ] it's more than a multivitamin I'll plan him in a it's good II what does that stuff Toco Toco trend all teletran out talk--i channels vitamin E family mm-hmm-hmm you ever heard of that Jim vitamin K look it up alright look it up it's a good thing too is that everything that's in it you know it's not only is it researchable but you'll see why like my biggest thing like as a guy that's not as familiar with the space I said who are the people that are they do it at a high level that I can incorporate into helping me build this product so I feel like you're never gonna do it by yourself you shouldn't try to do by yourself and you don't cut corners you don't go to cheap route you don't you don't do it wrong something you have to go back to do it again Brian so I went and I looked at the people that were involved with creating the quote-unquote best markets the best things on the market and I put that team together I put up a team like four to five I'm gonna tell you for years spent a lot of money developing this [ __ ] because it wasn't right in the beginning had to go back had to do it again wasn't right had to go back find out the other things they made other things better of things great had to go right go get it again go try it go do it again not right what else is out there what are we compared to until I felt that now when I launch there's going to be a place for my product in the market where people will understand that is exactly what I said it was there's no lying there is no you know false presentation behind the product Kevin Hartz multivitamins much more than multivitamin but more importantly it's something for everybody and more importantly it's to spark the hustle within all of us and it's the first there will be more but it'll be after I've mastered and done this at the highest level then I moved to product number two then I moved to product number three before you know it you want to see a [ __ ] whole line that Kevin Hart is slowly developed and that people can actually believe in because I'ma be a product of my own product that's the best thing in the world when you're a product of your product has to work for me before I say it's gonna work for everybody else so you take this stuff goddamn right I take it how long am I taking it I spent all this [ __ ] money I better take it I've been taking the the one that's launching now for about five to six months nice I've been taking this one I'm very happy because I actually feel the difference and the difference is just in the energy that you have with him day it's not an energy [ __ ] pill but I do feel a difference in my in my ability to last throughout my day like I'm I do a lot man I do it [ __ ] light so I told you I'm starting at that final 5:30 and I'm not shutting down to let 9 10 I saw a video once where you were taking a video of your your trainer passed out yeah like this lifestyle everybody very unattractive sleeper by the way shots out to Tim boss Ronald over line and one of the worst sleepers you have a seat so you take him with you everywhere yeah my trainers let me everywhere Wow everywhere so you train every day every day Wow every day Sunday's are light days like cardio maintenance is what we call it not doing the same thing all the time we switch it up love switching about love finding new things within Fitness to make it fun you never want to get bored within it so your your whole purpose is just to keep your vitality up keep your energy up just to keep it it's if I don't do it then there's a lag I need to train I need to do it because I I'm mentally so invested in it now that when I don't do it I feel like I've cheated myself in a in a day or a week that I've taken off I feel like yo man I'm not myself because when I am doing it I feel like I'm always I'm committed I'm committed to constantly building and reshaping and molding I'm working on me so when I'm not working on me I don't feel like my day that's supposed to be about me it's starting off with the biggest bang right this is my advantage to starting off like nobody else my day starts off before [ __ ] worms and birds get up I'm we're time to get up five five and that's when you start working out Jim 5:15 5:20 really 5:15 5:20 no food I don't eat I don't need before workout yeah I'm not I'm not I eat it before I workout never had didn't know what I am now because I'm getting older I'm more conscious of my body so I'm big with sports massages I'm big with you know making sure that I'm not putting myself in a position to get injured and overwork right so getting stretched you know trying to to do as much movement that as I possibly can like when I say I'm a little walking muscle I really AM so my flexibility is limited so right now that's my biggest focus so I'm about to start yoga trying to do that things that can just kind of keep me in a position to to not tighten up so I don't pull anything cuz I do so much are you gonna do hot yoga yeah do that [ __ ] all the time do you roll it love it amazing do it every week yeah only thing that's kept me from doing it is the smell and it's possibly you never that's the only thing that's kept me out of it I was like you gotta move past that yeah blessa I hear I get pretty bad sometimes it can yeah the place I go to is nice you just gotta make sure that the people take care of themselves well you know he'll be around smelly people I'll be honest I'm worried about myself I don't know what I'm gonna get especially if you get there early in the morning you know eat you won't worry about farting yeah but the people that eat breakfast yeah go they are letting off and everything I'll explain that the killer Mikey was talking to me about farting in yoga class I'm the guy can't be eating no can't be eating before that early are you going I like to go either 6:00 a.m. which is rare most of time 8:00 8:00 8:30 depends on where which place I go to - but you love it though yeah it's great for your head - it's 90 minutes of suffering you know it's hot it's [ __ ] you hundred five degrees hundred four degrees when you get out of there you feel like you did something really yeah and it just changes the way your body feels - in terms of your range of motion your flexibility all those weird connecting knots and everything just get opened up and you know my question is when you when you're just starting no yeah like like I will be is it extremely tough and a beginning again you just just gotta bring a lot of ice water just bring a big ol [ __ ] 64 ounce one of those of you know thermal flasks of ice water make sure you have enough water and drink enough water before it I'm talking put me in a bag yeah just start now I don't need to be what people could see me just we got like a section in the back yeah well you turn left you turn right everyone's gonna see you yes I'm saying can I be in a place where they go see me in the beginning like I don't want anybody to see you're athletic man you're gonna be fine you're gonna be tight it's gonna be difficult for you to pull off certain poses but you'll be fine I'm definitely gonna do it I'm definitely realize it's a challenge I'm definitely 100% gonna try your [ __ ] would you do too no that's next yeah that's next Justin I'm just on here listen this is where Rico was laughing because I say oh man don't laugh annotators I've never thrown a kick as I said whatever you show me right now is my first time doing it I don't I don't kick I don't know how to kick right so whatever you show me this is this will be me processing it for the first time and that day we did it we worked on and I think I threw a couple good kicks a couple good front kick and I said I said look after I'm done with boxing I said this will be my next test to learn how to probably throw some kicks and to move with my bottom half now that I've worked on my top that's my next hobby that's your next time you know jiu-jitsu is like that's the tough one in choice and you want to do that too I'm just this stuff as you get older you have to find [ __ ] to do right if you don't find [ __ ] to do you won't lose your mind you would get addicted to that I just wanna learn [ __ ] you would like it because there's so much to learn that's the thing about it it's a long long never ending never ending never ending journey of [ __ ] there's also there's so many different variations of each different individual move and entries into new moves and defense and then the structure of it is it's it gets so crazy it's it's super complicated my son my son does a my son is heavy into boxing in karate I got him meant to those so he he does them both so the reason why I want to do I just like to keep up with him so we can you know do things together I have trainers come to the house and we'll work out together he loves it so I just don't want to get left behind that you know we get 1718 which we'll say Dave I don't want that but we better back up when they start getting that much confidence I just want to be able to keep up and maintain so that's why I like to do it with them well it's good for a kid to to have that in your head which is not a defense confidence yeah you need that for confident it'll help you avoid things too well I tell my kids you know your last name puts a target on your back that you didn't ask for and we don't go and create problems but you should always be prepared for problems if they were to occur and if they do I just want you guys to know how to defend yourself so the things that I have my kids doing it just have the knowledge and understanding the worst thing is just not knowing you know they're growing up completely different than I grew up where I grew up you had no choice but to know if you ain't know how to fight that's your ass cuz you're gonna get tested there's no way around it you're gonna get tried you're gonna get robbed you're gonna get your bookbag take it it's am I gonna try to take snakes like it's the reality it's not a false reality that's real so if you're not prepared for it if you don't have any type of heart you won't last from where I grew up heart was everything and heart was sometimes saying I don't care if I get my ass whooped I'm not gonna be a [ __ ] I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie y'all to think that this can't happen so I'm gonna lose today but tomorrow I'm gonna complain and imma firin you imma talk whatever that moment was it was about establishing any level of respect that you could and I respect the eventually turned into friendship from all so my kids don't know what that world is like they're never gonna have it so as a parent I just have to make sure that you have all the tools that I can possibly equip you with because my president have the ability to provide me with it they weren't a financial space to to take me here and have this extra curricular activity or this extra curricular activity or learn it learn it then exist that is the big conundrum of successful Hebert can actually when successful people have kids the what made them successful is dry I grew up poor too we were on welfare and food stamps the whole deal when I was a little kid and that always stuck in my head this thought like we might not have enough food like I remember thinking that when I was a little like what if we don't have any food what if we run out of food my kids will never feel that they don't understand what that is and everybody that I've ever met that's interest came from some crazy struggle yeah when they were young yeah and that's the thing of your you and I and most people that are doing well in life you're raising your kids in a completely different way then literally what brought you to the dance and the first that's the hunger of not being one of those people that's left behind is what makes you successful in the first place and it's scary it's scared because you know my wife my wife told me she was like you know I love that you're not hard on your kids but you always make sure there's a lesson within your conversation like I don't yell I'll yell at my kids nothing's gonna register when I'm yelling so I tried my best to talk to you everyone I met my angriest I'm gonna talk to you so you can process this because you need to understand what's the problem you need understand what's wrong and what I had to really realize is they didn't ask to be born into this yeah you know I mean like that it's not their fault right that they're coming up completely different than how we were raised right and we can't have anger or frustration that's dedicated and thrown towards them because they got it so much better than what we had how do we make sure to be passed down to proper lessons so that they appreciate and understand and not take for granted right they have right for me it's tough because good kids good students their plot themselves in school they listen they don't do dumb [ __ ] yeah they want to play video games and stay up like any other kid there's no signs of a bad or crazy yeah and the fear and panic is that you got a note it bad and crazy exists right this fairy tale day we're in isn't real and at some point when I'm not around when your mother's not around when you have friends or other family on around you may get tested with the other side that's out here that you've never seen right so I gotta prepare you for the [ __ ] that you don't know exists I gotta take you to Philadelphia so you can see I try to show my kids where I grew up thinking that's going be like oh my goodness backfired it's so cool can we live here shut up [ __ ] you told my everybody here the car right now around you talk like this move your back this does not go well supposed to oh my gosh so cool dad is so different oh my goodness walked him around a neighborhood and it's like it's it's it's not a reality you didn't have grass and that's dad oh that's great would you play why were you here yeah when you hear these things it's so different man these were your steps the steps are broken how did you even play oh my god dad so wait we're weird was yours we lived on the top floor not the whole thing no it's this is three separate units so the top floor was me and grandmom's the middle that was somebody else that was a neighbor and downstairs or somebody else three different people lived in this one thing together y'all with strangers my own hands I don't know I don't know what's say it this part yeah right in the car but but when you see that that's the reality that you get hit with of I gotta make sure that I'm talking I gotta make sure that I'm constantly teaching yeah if I'm not and I'm not doing my part I'm failing you know took them to the neighborhood and showed them how stores are in the neighborhood it's what we got candy from here's here's what we would get little sandwiches from y'all walk we don't have no stores like this we can't walk this stuff it's a completely different world well it's a completely different world see people stand on the street corners what they doing they're big they selling drugs that's that's tough right there those are people that your dad still knows they've been there forever that's what you don't want to do but they're forced with these decisions just because of what they have to do you just need to see this dad is taking you here to see this drove them all around all around North Philadelphia all around South Philadelphia made sure they could see yeah physically see we go out the country we go to these resorts and islands before we go they're gonna drive around so you can see what exists before you get to this this is why we have to be good people this is why we treat everybody with respect this is why your dad likes to give everybody doesn't have I'm constantly beating my kids with that information because if you assume that everybody does you come off like such an [ __ ] when you're around people that don't yeah like how did you you don't also the advantage that they had growing up the way they are now it's such a rare thing and they don't understand it there's no way there's a small percentage yeah a very small percentage and that's something that I never want to let go of either so I was in the back of my head are you talking about how you know are we gonna have enough food you were coming up Chris Rock's joke is so great that he used to tell the hi he keeps a bag packed at the front door cuz he don't believe that this [ __ ] is his I truly believe you thin at any point somebody gonna go gotcha you thought you lived here did you visit joy and I was like it's so real because even though you have it you can't lose the sight a reality of where you once was yeah do you are you comfortable where you are now or do you still have those thoughts like this is this real because you you're at this stratosphere of Fame and success that's it's rare amongst the rare hmm you know it's like David Goggin says you are uncommon amongst uncommon men I will be a hundred percent honest and say I'm comfortable with the understanding of hard work brings great rewards this is a reminder of the hard work and dedication that I put into everything that I've done I'm not content because I know where I came from and I don't ever want to go back that doesn't mean I don't want to go back to the city that doesn't mean I'm gonna go back to the people that means I don't want to go back to living like I once was I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna help I want to inspire what a motivate I want to show people that there is a way out that there is a way to do more to get more to obtain more but I personally don't want to lose all that I've been able to get so I need to make sure that I do everything to keep it so I can't be content mmm so there is an understanding but I refuse to click on the switch of so even if you like even if you have more money than you'll ever spend for the rest of your life that's not what it's about it's about the inspiring people and the influence and constantly giving back and moving forward in a positive way and the only way you can do that is to stay active it's the story man yeah you know we're we're all writing a book what's your book look like mmm what is your [ __ ] book look like like your life is a bulk you got a bunch of chapters in your book but when they closed that book how good was the book how good was your book what was the ending to your book if the ending to my book can be so amazing because of all that was done the money all that was accomplished the first to do the man that did this he caused a merger between this because of his commitment and growth to this the communities were then given this made education this changed the way the schooling was Baba Baba gave books gave computers gave all of the things that can be associated with you and your existence become a part of the chapters in your book so my drive is about my book I was a New York Times number-one bestseller people will be done they did it I'm writing another book you ready to vote right now yeah what's it happened what happens if you are to Tom New York Times number-one bestseller if you get the two what happens if you get the three hey man how do books become successful who publishes them I want to start a publishing company heartbeat publishing why not mmm that's the thing all I'm doing is sparking the awareness and others to go why might why can't I create why can't I start why can't I be a business why can't I be a CEO why can't I be a tech guru why can't I [ __ ] create cooking products lotions since there's so much that some people just don't understand they can do let me be a spot to show how much how many different you don't have to do just one thing when it's all said and done my book is gonna be full of all this [ __ ] that Kevin Hart did cuz I never was content with doing just one two or three why not Kevin why are you creating [ __ ] health and wellness products why not I'm big on health and wellness why can't I why can't I try to create something that I filled is [ __ ] great and jump into a space that I'm already in I already give a hundred percent of me in this space why not why can't I talk about financial wealth why can't I go back and educate those that don't know why not you got time I make time well you certainly can but it's just so unusual that someone dedicates that much energy and time to giving back and getting involved with the kind of projects that you're talking about as well as be super ambitious with your own career it makes me happy yeah I could tell I'm genuinely happy discovery makes me happy like when you find different things to be excited about it makes me happy and it's weird when it clicks and schooldays to tell you all the time information is key read these books there's so much knowledge [ __ ] that book time to read that book I want to go home goddamn Sonic the Hedgehog I want to play I'm at level 3 I got something to read this book the information is stuff there it was forced down your throat at a certain age you just you just may not be receiving it correctly but then it clicks you may gain information differently and what you do with that information is up to you but people people have different roles they can go down the education wasn't my pick of choice it didn't do it for me but the knowledge in the common sense that I have naturally allowed me to gain information apply it differently it allowed me to grow smarts in so many\n",
      "is stuff there it was forced down your throat at a certain age you just you just may not be receiving it correctly but then it clicks you may gain information differently and what you do with that information is up to you but people people have different roles they can go down the education wasn't my pick of choice it didn't do it for me but the knowledge in the common sense that I have naturally allowed me to gain information apply it differently it allowed me to grow smarts in so many different avenues to where I said oh my god I found my niche I found my talent and now there's other things that my talent can take me to I don't have the all the knowledge and awareness but I can allow myself people to do that can teach me because now guess what learning is cool ya know what happened you don't have to do it anymore right it's its own you're a kid they force you into this school you don't want to learn but then when you get out and you realize like oh this actually benefits me does it make me a better person this makes me wiser it's 100 percent dirty and it's weird how it happens but when you go oh my god learning and knowledge is power mmm [ __ ] they used to tell me this when I was 10 my quads yes mom sons 10 11 years old I heard that [ __ ] all the time now I finally get it damn I'm about to be 40 took me all this time to get the goddamn code but I got it yeah it hits you at a different time mm-hmm and when it does be excited about it man you excited I'm excited about what 50 years I'm just now getting to 40 do you read books I don't read a lot of books do you listen to books on tape I have listened to books you know what let's do what Tony Robbins he's great Tony's a like I like his approach to giving information mm-hmm I like his attitude in general I like podcasts I like things that are real and out of presented in front of me I like information that I can go to the source and and touch and talk so I'm I and I'm reading a book it's a book that was recommended by such-and-such and the person who gave it to me and that's reading that book I learn more about the individual that I thought I already knew and now I gain more Michelle Obama's book great book great [ __ ] book I met her I talked to her I've been in the same rooms I've seen her success what is her book gonna be about mmm or read a book Wow I get it I get wise moving all the units that it's moving I get why women are reading his book and walking away feeling better feeling like they can't I get it oh wow hmm certain friends Dwyane Wade wrote a book focused on being a father his road to becoming a better father what he went through with his kids mother he developed a relationship than a bond with his sons like nobody else Wow didn't know that day that's dope I love how you put it on page there's certain things that you just want to know certain books help I understand why people read books I get what the information does you know the book that I'm working on now is all about the mental approach that you have with life and people not understanding that your biggest enemy is you my whole book is about you battling yourself people to understand is you against you the only person that gets in your way is you nobody else is you now when you write a book like this and especially about something like this this is like the way you've managed to navigate through life mm-hmm are do you do you write it out in essays do you do you do you have like bullet points that you you think about and then once you have those bullet points you had then you write on those how do you do it get on your phone it's all all voice notes and transcripts okay so because of your time you don't have you don't have the the time to sit and actually write mm-hmm so you need somebody that you can talk to for hours hours hours on it hey I need a hour but I gotta holler for me I got some stuff we want to talk to you about keV what what's that all right book title ideas subtitle ideas my dedication is my introductions within my introductions these are all powerful paragraphs and things that I was just said that are now transcript I get to go back and read it come see here there's no conversation at all every one of them um no conversation all and that's what the Internet has allowed people to do Internet has allowed people to skip steps 1 through 30 as a lot of people to jump straight to 100 [ __ ] you good job off take them down you should be dead oh god [ __ ] can't stand this whatever the hater the anger is when listen when listen ok when I listen and I can change I'm not that guy we're doing these weird things now that people aren't taking the time to sit and think through what I've understood is that what people are doing has nothing to do with me I should always be a step ahead because I'm thinking differently because I'm thinking about myself making myself better puts me in a position to make others better be the example not the problem the best way to take away the problem is to a lien 8 yourself from it these are business thoughts oh it's [ __ ] thought I can go through and just read this is a so you just have these philosophies of your life and you just just speak it listen just speak it dance so now this is all chance capable Columbus's that's incredible there's all [ __ ] transcript this is all Sarge's go back throughout the day and I read it and I say this is great this makes sense this didn't let me reword this I mean make sure that it's all flowing together and at the end of the day what's my reason for the book my reason for the book is make you better my reason for the book is to make people understand yeah we all agree we all should think that we're great there's no reason for you to not think that you're great if you don't think you're great ask yourself why why don't you think the highest of yourself when you do people have no no choice but to follow suit mmm you had no choice but to follow suit a lot of people they base it on their past they base it on the life that they've experienced up until this moment makes you better yeah it does make you back you better make you smarter yeah unless you say it yeah man that's what's interesting about it that's what's interesting about life you can hear a guy like you say that and then it changes your perspective and then you'll go out and take action that you might not have taken before I had a 585 on my SAT confessions I didn't take money confession they give you 404 put your name on a paper it's true story Wow I guessed a BAC a da I did abracadabra true story swear to God hand on my mother's grave a BAC a da I didn't care because there was a class trip that same day I wanted to go great adventure I was told they're not taking my SAT seriously but prohibit me from furthering myself in life that's what I was told at the moment I said damn maybe I should have maybe I should've applied myself maybe I should have been different when I saw my friends get their test scores back and they were ecstatic 800-900 960s everybody's going to college I felt like the biggest idiot in the [ __ ] world the biggest idiot in the [ __ ] world because the same people that I want to rush to go to great adventure with they had taken an SAT a week before they already got their work done mmm they did everything they were supposed to do so that moment of fun was real fun for them I was the only dumbass that didn't prioritize and take care of my [ __ ] so I'm the only one going to Community College everybody's else off to Villanova Temple University Drexel University god damn I just got left behind why didn't y'all tell me that y'all did it the week before how come you only tell me that we was serious about the college [ __ ] you ain't tell me I was trying to go to simple or Drexel all wait it's because my life isn't their life they're focused on themselves wow that they're doing what they're supposed to do hey jackass go sit by yourself and figure it out cuz that's where you should be lesson learn any opportunity given should be taking series from this point on because if not you can find yourself feeling just like this it's not I get down on myself a [ __ ] moment I learn from it I learned from it now I got to take a goddamn test you best believe I'm studying for that [ __ ] test cuz I don't want to feeling like I'm the guy mmm that didn't prepare now I got a story to tell my kids about what it feels like to be the kid in class that didn't prepare that's got the words great when they give all those grades back but it's because of my experience I don't look down on those moments you take those moments you make the best of them because their life lessons it's that simple you're saying it's positive but it's really just simplicity that's real real it's real and it's your life experience and it's your life's lessons 100% but the fact that a guy like you comes out and talks about it like that that's where it makes it really powerful because it's not just something that you learn from but now other people can learn from your past too that's what I'm hoping they'll look at themselves and they realize like we all start from a different spot you're not saying yeah this is why I'm so candid I'm so candid I'm so open they're there there is no like guys I'm fine with being an open book I'm fine with the good the bad ugly I'm fine being flawed I'm fine with all the things that have happened to me that have been exposed I'm fine with it all I don't hide from it I don't run from it I don't I don't avoid any of it I'm fine it's all right it's a bed that I made for myself I happily lay in it and I'll be fine figuring it out moving forward son don't stop for nobody man son don't [ __ ] stop so I'm gonna be up in the morning regardless that son is gonna be up in the morning regardless of how I [ __ ] feel and how depressed I am the Sun is gonna [ __ ] shine in the morning and the night time the moon gonna be there and you gonna look up these days gonna keep going by so do you let the days go by and look up and you don't wasted a year doing what what do you just pick it up alright I'll figure it out made some mistakes life goes on let me figure out life from this point I'm a life goes on type of guy you're a bad [ __ ] Kevin Hart very very very inspirational and I'm really glad you came down here and talked about I'm I'm more than glad I think that it took too long actually and this is the first of what will be many men I'm for sure I'm a fan too and I just think what you're doing is not just inspirational in terms of like what you've been able to achieve and who you are but also inspirational and how you're so dedicated to helping other people that means a lot to me it's very it's very motivating it's very powerful I wanna I want all your listeners know that it's not it's not at all no this is this is no way it could be you if you were doing that just for talk and be like listen just fake it and then become that guy because you're honest if you could do that and just say it and talk [ __ ] forget about whatever it's fake or not don't you guys trust me you will be seeing more the financial fitness is real this relationship with Chase and no she's making sure you put me in a position to give the information that I have and to the people that

      "here we go in five four three two one yes and all the [ __ ] people that make me feel lazy in this world is - okay make me feel you in the rock you [ __ ] don't look like you ever sleep and I don't know no days off that's why I love is unattractive ass he's a he's a person that that motivates me inspires me in effect that we're we're coworkers were friends I think is I think it's like it's a blessing it's a blessing to be around that yeah because it truly it's it's uplifting you know it makes you it just makes you weed out the circle when you're around people that truly give you like give you some good serve a good value to you and your life you then look at those that don't and you can you can then push away so I'm big on I'm big on personality I'm big on energy I'm big on will and once I believe that is contagious so if you have a bunch of laziness and a bunch of [ __ ] around you naturally it's gonna feed off you're gonna find yourself becoming what's in your environment so I feel the exact same way and when I see I see that in you I see that in you I've seen avatar I see you I see you yeah but a guy like that like I always wonder like how much of that is look I've had sleep experts on the podcast to tell you like like there's real problems if you don't get enough sleep like you could you have a much higher risk of Alzheimer's well there's other serious issues but I see a guy like the rock I'm like how the [ __ ] does he sleep what where's the room to for sleep you know that that's true I can't say that I'm that I've witnessed the sleep patterns but he's a he's a late ass so he does I know he's sleeping to some rest which is well-deserved but you know when you when you say you had these sleep experts and stuff on it's always a thing that I go back and forth about because what is enough sleep like I'm a person I function high off of six to seven hours yeah six seven hours I'm I'm functioning yeah five hours I'm great do I do the five hour thing all the time no but if I have to I'm fine I don't need the eight and the nine like that's too much for me like I'm I'm an early riser and now I'm getting older you know if I can get in that bed by 9:30 or 10:00 on an off workday I'm very happy with that but then I'm up at 5:30 I'm up at 5:00 so what is it enough sleep what do they tell you this really depends on the person there are people that have a gene where they can just sleep for hours at night I got gone oh my god I got that what is that gold what is that what does this means you got special gene goddamn right Amalia yeah that's um [ __ ] there are there are people that just don't need as much they can they can go a long time without sleep diagnosed me I'm one of those people you thought you might be I bet a lot of high functioning people are cuz your body tends to you get more efficient you know like you you're always going you're burning hard so your body's like when it's time to shut down it's like shut down get that five six hours in alright do you do well I will confess this I am an amazing cat Napper yeah I'm one of those guys if you stop talking to me long enough i'ma fall asleep right here it's something about silence real and just not doing anything and I just well it's probably probably going on momentum all the time you probably you're probably going on motivation and momentum okay then when your body has this break you've already here's a little sleeper that's just right I'm dead serious that's I know for sure that that's accurate cuz I'm how catnapping heartbeat do you feel like you've hit a good balance so this is what I was wonder about guys like you or guys like the rock when I look at your Instagram your social media and you're just constantly going like god damn do you ever feel like you do too much like maybe I just need to take a little break here do you ever feel like that I think perception definitely perceives reality you know what looks like so much isn't always so much because you have a schedule and you know within that schedule there's the things that mean the most that come in act is downtime you know me in my house is downtime even though it's still active and I gotta be dead and I'm with the kids and a wife in this conversation and I'm running around and I'm back for that still exes downtime for me like I'm shutting a work off so the phone is any office I'm not going back to get it until the morning and it's all conversation it's all TV it's all Taco Tuesdays it's couch and cuddling you know baby time whatever that's my downtime because I'm taking a step outside of the other [ __ ] that's wise that's that's what I think I do very well I can step outside the other [ __ ] I can separate it so I think when you're able to do that then you're you're managing your mental you don't mean like if it's if it's always one thing all the time that's how you [ __ ] drive yourself crazy cuz you never you're never shutting it off yeah and I think I do a good job of shutting shutting this off and focusing on this like when I want my family I'm with my family nothing is nothing interjects or comes in between that's fantastic that's so important it's understand that's beautiful I doubt that's gigantic I think I figured it out that's it you mean you've got so much success it's all you have to be with that [ __ ] phone all the time that's that that's the phone is the big one right well phone the phone is is the gift and the curse mm-hmm you know I think that we we shout out the gate and saw the gift oh my god it's it's it's community is connecting us we're able to share we're able to meet new people we're able to stay in communication with with all people find new people as entertainer I can engage with my fans and this is so dope and then after that you get hit with the the curse and the curses there's a there's a high level of negativity that's out there that's on that [ __ ] you know there's there's a lot of people that are you know not happy or going through things and they interject a certain amount of negativity and hatred through these devices these devices are the easiest way to touch everybody so when you're just consumed on that [ __ ] all day you start to see yourself being a part of the negative [ __ ] yeah so what I've learned to do is go I don't I don't need to see that I don't need to see that [ __ ] I don't I don't pay that any mind I don't read that [ __ ] for what it's not it's not helping me it's not making me better it's not it's not pushing me to new limits if anything is taken up just creative space by me literally spending time going and navigating through what I think is is a bunch of [ __ ] you know so I don't let the device beat me and at one point I definitely did at one point it was everything there was everything you know now I separate it I'm not embrace clear of it what when you realize what it is when you see when you see the bad you know when you see the bad side of it I thought the other day this is some real [ __ ] and it really made me think my phone died my phone died and I'm driving and I was using the [ __ ] maps and I said [ __ ] what the [ __ ] am I get to with I don't know where I'm going I said I was like you know how did we how did we get from point A to point B before the map [ __ ] what were we doing that I used to print out directions from Google Maps I remember that but then before that how did you get to the places where you were going that you didn't know how to get to I don't even remember remember Thomas guys do you remember Thomas Scott I did have a Thomas guy when I first moved to LA I did have a Thomas guy and I know look a hundred percent bill burr had one two a three years ago but it really [ __ ] me up because I was like how do we don't even know how how to do the common yeah the the the norm anymore because the device has made everything available and I literally had to to drive to store rocket buy a charger charge up my phone to get back and use the map to get to where the [ __ ] I was going I had no idea how to get there I had no I didn't know no numbers by heart I didn't know who I was gonna call oh my god this is the moment where I was like what level of success have I reach I just pulled over and I said here and I was like how the [ __ ] am I gonna get the widow's bear phone man I don't know what it were a backup phone it felt like the end of the world if it felt like it was over house like [ __ ] and that crazy I dependent you are but that's when the light bulb started to click yeah it started to click like how how do we function without I want to go backwards a little bit yeah it's still there I still need it I still think it's dope with all of the things that we can do want it but I still want to be able to put it down and step away from it my kids to be able to step away from it that's why when I come in the house my phone is up cuz I can't I can't [ __ ] and get playing it's all about being on your phone if you see me doing the same thing right right so that time those conversations me wanting to know about your day you talking to me about your day your friends who you like who don't you like my daughter you what boy who what no ok my son yeah I like somebody who oh jesus here it comes it's a great thing and I want to be able to have those moments and you know I think it's it's it's big to make sure that you prioritize that are you worried about what comes next hundred percent I'm worried that something's gonna be way more intrusive than that it'sit's what do you mean it's already happening yeah the biggest scare happened already with the the the FaceTime [ __ ] that happened where whatever whoa Apple on the iPhones it was like people could listen in to your oh yeah if you didn't need to pick up the FaceTime you could just yeah and you know that was the scariest [ __ ] ever because it's if it's that easy to have a bug like that what's the thing that's not a bug that's there that you just don't know about oh there's definitely government listen to us well hunter is it yeah 100 everything everybody says and then in case one day you do something wrong they go by your side mr. Hart we'd like you to sit down from NYU something hundred percent yeah so the fear is the next level of them are intrusive you know I think everything has become intrusive now like the toughest thing for me is that there is no there is no privacy outside my home right you know the the amount of money that you have to now spend just on security on you know people to to be with me security to be on my home you know it's like they're there literally is no privacy and it's not a bit you complain about it because without the fans without the people that support me I wouldn't be where I am but there's no middle ground right you know there is no handshakes anymore it's it's how you doing right right right yeah a handshake is so much better right I get a moment like I'm we can talk if that's what you no no yo say it now weird cuz you you're doing this to me it's kind of weird to have a conversation so you're just starting to see yourself become a little older and wiser and uh just really see the times for what they are and see the direction that we're going in this people and just hope and pray that we find a middle ground because I think right now that is it one yeah that's what I'm feeling now no I feel it too and I especially I mean what you're talking about is you being super famous and losing all your privacy but everyone's losing their privacy yes slowly but surely it's it's happening to you because you're very famous and because you do something that's in the public eye and people want to see you and they want to stick that camera in front of you but there's gonna come a point in time where what we're dealing with now which is like you have to turn your phone on you have to you know you have to reach out to somebody you have to put something up that's that steps gonna be out of the way who's gonna be people being able to act that's your life yeah pretty you know you know the bad here's what I said it's bad that really [ __ ] with me I don't like that negativity is the the want you know like like the the thing that's popular is the failure the the [ __ ] up you know the the fight that I can catch you know the hateful moment that I can catch and post like the bad is being highlighted and celebrated that's what [ __ ] with me what the social media [ __ ] now what really bothers me is you know when you see these things online like you know a fight and there's a man hitting a woman and it's captured right that's bad the bad thing is that you watched that the the video was more important than the actual help right or the moment to step in and you know when you see these things where you're catching people do these things to kids and it's caught the moment of what you got and what you want to post and get likes or whatever on is the focus instead of the help yeah and that's that's the part that is just I just have a hard time processing I have a hard time processing what the likes mean to certain people well you get an extraordinary amount of attention so it doesn't mean anything to you anyway it means something to a regular person but you a regular person if they can catch some worldstar video and put it up they're like dude that's my video that's my video look my video got 5 million hits yeah my video has gone viral my videos everywhere for them it's like it's a point of excitement that's why when they see you look oh [ __ ] how often are they gonna run into Kevin Hart at you know Costco or wherever the [ __ ] you were definitely running right it to me on uh you know I'm in a I'm in a bathroom restaurant and I go to the bathroom you know by the way that I went to the bathroom you could definitely tell I had to [ __ ] I was I was moving fast I was he knows one of those abrupt you know why you eatin yeah I'm eating bad so I didn't eat bad in a while my stomach immediately said that's not gonna happen today I get up and I go and literally like like three seconds I hear it as I'm walking or they go keV hard and as I'm walking by a guy gets up follows me in the bathroom he's like yo I gotta get a picture man and I said let me let me go to the bathroom when I'm done I'll take a picture with you I go to the bathroom this is a true story hannah bible hand on the Bible I assume the guys outside the bathroom cuz I as I'm going I see him and I say what I say I get done I go to the snake wash my hand he was just sitting behind a wall and he's like got his phone out I'm like he probably did he just take me while I was [ __ ] dude put the phone over the thing like I'm about to be on oh my god it's over this is it this is my nightmare here we go they're about to put something up of me shittin is the bottom of my feet it's whatever yeah but he just waited and in that moment was so it was so important that he was in the bathroom and soon as I got a call on the second I said let's go outside the bathroom yeah let's take a picture it's a bathroom I said might am I going to I'm a nice guy man I'm gonna take the picture cuz I just don't want to lose you and I'm like there's not even a thought it's not even a thought about it's a bad price how weird is that Sebastin minutes this is a this is a pretty [ __ ] weird moment man this is weird Halloween you will be the finish [ __ ] no no what you got on your phone right you're too big for me to ask to go through your phone or whatever you got you got but I had to go out and take the picture and I remember going back to the table just like what's happening that's not strange at this point what is happening yeah that didn't exist before I think if you were famous before people just wanted to get an autograph or shake your hand what Pat what passed an autograph stage was last time you get an autograph it's been a while I don't write it I was I think I would know what to put that it's been a minute man yeah and I don't want to make this very clear you know it's not I don't I don't know you know I understand like once again I want people to more importantly understand the fact that I welcome it yeah I welcome the moment that I can talk in and converse with the fame but it should be that like it's normal people the moments are better when they're real you know and after a real moment you you get a picture because you're like yo he was actually a nice guy or I know I did it that you would be this calm and cool you don't even get to see how genuine of a person I am because the first thing you do you you you stick the camera in the face you and that's when people think that you're an [ __ ] because they they they they have the intrusive moment that then gets met with the can you keep please I'm sorry you're not the you look at my face you're gonna be like that they look for that now you get your moment yeah you you look for the negative moment when does it start getting weird for you but how many years in um I know it's been it's been pretty crazy I've been pretty crazy for like the last four to five the last four to five years and the last three you know if it's gotten insane because now you know you're you're on an international level its global and the following is is bigger and it's all ages which is which is really really good but I think you know for comedians it's a different thing because you feel like you know comedians you know you're laughing we're in your homes everything is met with warmth so when you see a comedian especially if you're a fan of a comedian you're associating everything with funny and you're just looking for the funny moment right you're you're looking past a normal moment you know it's like you you almost are frowned upon if you're normal if you just chill right right right because everybody wants the funny moment right they thought you were gonna be funny like I'm supposed to I suppose a pop lock right on the site you know yeah if it's 2:00 in the morning and you run into me and I say hey how you doing man that's not enough when work out your [ __ ] now mm-hmm I've seen you at the Comedy Store but only once where do you work out your [ __ ] I like to go to random comedy clubs you know I think I'll go to New York first New York has always been a home when it comes to building putting some structure within a set that you trying to figure out once I got a skeleton of what I want to do I'll just go to West Palm I love that comedy club The Improv down there and all the place is great I'll stay for two weeks Oh real and just go and run through some jokes I'll go to Utah I'll go to Denver who do two wise guys yeah yeah yeah I'll go to comedy clubs just random comedy clubs that you wouldn't expect to see me at but I'll do a hell of a run and the goal is to get out of there with just a foundation not to have a complete set I just want to get a foundation so when I'm done getting the foundation then I'll do a little comedy club run I'll do a full comedy club run where I'll just put two or three months in and it's comedy club comedy club comedy club and I'm doing seven shows a weekend and people are shocked that I'm there and then I'm doing it but you know that's my that's my gym that's how I work and I end up leaving that period of time with a complete set after the first three or four months that I spent now after that comedy club three or four months on that run then I take it to like a small theater I see what my laughter feels like in a small theater and I do a little run in small theaters and then when I finally feel like it's at a point where I'm getting the the laughs consistently and the punchlines are working and I flipped it back frontwards forward every direction and my story is a real roller coaster and it has an ending where I feel like we get off the roller coaster and we're happy and you don't feel like you were there for an hour mmm is then when I go test it out in every nough and if the arena if the last er sounds the way it's supposed to then I say okay I'm ready if it doesn't then I'll go back to small theaters and then I'll go to an arena again so not to that arena sounds the way it's supposed to do I say I'm going on tour so sometimes it takes me about a year a year and three months here in four months you know people don't say how hard it is to develop our of stand-up material people act like you just turn on a new hour it's it's an hour to get to an hour you're going through four to five hours of [ __ ] that you thought was funny yeah to come up to that hour that you finally say this is gonna be the representation of me this year yeah it's a lot for me to do that especially at this level you know well especially while you're always doing movies and you're always busy with a bunch of other stuff to stuff yourself yeah you don't take any breaks white or I actually you know when I'm touring if there's a movie I make the movie schedule around the torso my shooting days will go Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday rap Thursday maybe ever show Thursday night and then I'm going Thursday Friday Saturday sometimes no show Sunday sometimes show Sunday depending on what the work schedule and the workload for the following week would look like so I'm implementing that in so when I say I'm out I'm out I'm gone yeah so I've knocked that movie out in two months and then when I'm not that tour schedule shifts so the Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday dedicated the family dedicated to an office everything then those weekends are torn but that's all last for a year and a half I mean this year we did 157 shows on my irresponsible tour Wow 157 show before you decided to put it on the Netflix special yeah we did the Netflix the taping I think I did it three weeks before we were done so we probably had 143 shows oh wow then I taped it and finish the tour did you always have this kind of structure like when did you how did you design this thought-out individual yeah I mean thought-out individual it's not random no everything is planned if you look at all my stand-up specials there's a two-year gap in between them so the two-year gap is because at the end of that second year my new special should be coming out when a new special should be coming out I'm now focusing on what the next special is going to be so that first year is all development like right now I'm off I'm not touring but now I'm mentally in the gym and throwing all the old stuff that I talked about a way that's now thrown out can't repeat it can't say it now it's talking about what the new version of myself is going to be what do I want the conversation to be and what's my thinking and just taking notes so eventually now I'm gonna start just popping up a random comedy clubs and trying to figure out what the next thing is so by mid mid 20 I'm probably doing comedy clubs by the end of 20 I have a full fledge concept of that new hour and by the beginning of 21 I should be ready to go out with my new hour hmm end of 21 film my new our mid 22 that hour will come out that seems like a schedule a lot of people are doing now the 2-year schedule it's a perfect get yeah that's hard dude I know louis c.k did a year every year and George Carlin did every year but I think even he said really wasn't the right way that's tough a year stuff yeah I mean that's a that's a shout-out to those that can't do it I think that's amazing [Music] I think just for everything that I have going on and all of the different things that my hands are in within the brand the business I need to make sure that I'm giving a hundred percent change those things so they have the highest opportunity to be successful right if I'm trying to cheat it then it's gonna show you know it's not gonna come out to the best of my ability and with that stand up you got a you got a [ __ ] magnifying glass on you you know you're always being judged off of what you did at one point just like a musician you're always judged off of the album that everybody thought was whatever so the biggest thing for an entertainer artists whatever your craft is is creation how you recreating yourself how are you constantly showing that you're growing for me the only way to do that is to talk about my life and the things that grow along with me the only thing that grows along with me my experiences my family my marriage my mistakes my UPS my downs those are the things that I can talk about further because as you get older things change it gets different it's all coming from my personal opinion of me my view on me and how I see Life you can't lose material in that state mmm that's why I stay away from certain things because those things can become boring after a while for me because I don't have the knowledge of everything that I should like what well politics I don't know joke in the politics I don't I don't joke and anything that has to do with the slander of others or other communities I don't do anything divisive good for you that's my that's my biggest thing and you know this past year was was one that got a little weird because I was like you know I've really dedicated myself to breaking people together like I'm I know that was my my goal that's my priority I damn sure thought that's what I was doing on a global scale everybody all races shapes sizes whoever you are whatever you are you can come to a Kevin Hart show I have a good time so when it came off as if I was a person that was divisive that was tough you talking about the Oscar Oscar [ __ ] yeah this is a time where people are just looking to be upset about things a hundred they're they're not looking to looking at you Kevin Hart as just a human being like what who is he who overall super positive they're not even concentrating on that I mean think about how positive you are and yet they tried to concentrate on some jokes that you did what nine years ago it was a it's a it's a wake up call of understanding the times but it more importantly you know for me it was okay I went through it I made sure that the people of the LGBTQ community really understand it hey guys I apologized before but I'm apologizing again I'm sorry I'm not that guy I don't want you to think I'm that guy then it just became the constant conversation there never happened that it just became the constant conversation and and now it is guys I'm not only sorry I don't condone anything that has to do with hate to anybody this is no longer conversation so guys I'm gonna stop talking about it because now I feel like I'm feeding into yes what not I I know I'm not the world and public should understand and know them not because over this time period I've shown that I'm not so the apology once again I'm sorry genuinely I'm sorry but then it just kept it just it never stopped and at that point I just made a decision and I'm like guys at this point I just I'm making a decision to not talk about it anymore that doesn't mean that I'm being disrespectful to anybody that doesn't mean as I'm shutting down anything it means that for me I'm gonna stop talking about it because at this point I don't know what to do at this point I thought I thought the apology is what you wanted me to do I did it I made sure did you understand that I'm not a hateful person at Noga don't hate I did that I stepped down so I don't take attention off of that night knows people that are there to be celebrated I don't want to draw attention to myself and what's around me I step down everything I did was for the better of good I'm stepping away guys because I don't want this to be a negative night or a negative thing and then it still became a conversation so I waited for it to die down I went on my radio show gave another public apology make sure doesn't he understand it I'm sorry I hope these words didn't hurt anybody I once again apologized I don't condone hate to anyone I hope that you guys can forgive me for those jokes of oh so now I say if you don't understand it you don't believe it I don't know what else to give I don't know what else to do there's nothing else you can do that's very wise of you nothing it's very wise easy to step away like that because if you didn't they would probably pursue it forever but I mean it's it becomes a point of attention that's all it is it's decided that this is something they're gonna focus on what I had a I had a good talk and I'm gonna talk about this for a minute friend of mine Lee Daniels you know man Lee Daniels Lee called me told me where to talk to you know Lee Daniels is director producer the show empire's his biggest shows you know so he calls me he's like everyone talk to you and and I was talking he's like look this is a time where you could speak up and talk about you know the community that's been affected by hatred and you know hateful crimes you can step up and be a voice and say that you don't condone or don't stand with any type of hate or whatever you can take that stage and do that and I said Lee I said that's I understand what you're saying I said well why did you expect me to know what's been happening with in this community in regards to hate and crimes I said I I'm not aware I said some people can just not be aware I'm not even no I have no idea what's going on I have no idea yes within that community I have no idea right when you tell me this I'm now educated and I understand so it's easy to simply inform right information is key when people get information they process the information when you can process the information you go oh wait a minute that makes sense hey if you guys think that I can don't hate wait a minute I don't and anybody that does [ __ ] you man that's bad you shouldn't I can say that but instead when this happened it was become an ally mmm become a voice you know and that's that's where there was just a miscommunication that's where a back and forth kind of was established that I think people just started to take things and run with it and I'm just not I'm just not one to feed into what I feel isn't going to eventually evolve into a positive thing in a real conversation yes yeah when I'm trying my best to it was becoming tabloid [ __ ] as opposed to like a real discussion click me yeah click click me that's the problem there's so much bait out there because it's such an effective way to get people to pay attention to things because as you said people focus on failure and negative and anger that's what we want to see controversy that's what we want to see people don't want to see the anger yeah and and you know we think that is because it's just the times it's it's that's what's cool now always being negative you know how you always have some people it's a great example how you have people mean you can talk about a movie all right we can talk about Titanic wow it's authentic one of the biggest movies of all time [ __ ] great movie yes it was great movie and why guy for no reason go I [ __ ] hated it yeah why yeah like Titanic [ __ ] [ __ ] why manga yeah I know what tell me why'd you hate it I got time talk about that the cool thing is just being different I wanna I wanna be completely opposite Denali Contreras how the people you know what no no that [ __ ] was ass what Wow Wow why was it ass we have people that just like to do this oh yeah for sure and and and what happens when one person does it another person for no reason all go yeah me too yeah she was ask man i hain't like it either did you see it what y'all talkin about you don't even know what they're talking about but you just want to hop on the negative train right because that's what's cool it's not cool to be positive it's not cool to be happy I don't know if it's a cool thing I think it's usually people that are really frustrated with their lives 100% what's the that's the factual side to it I did a joke before was like do you think Michael Jordan leaves YouTube comments like people want to get mad and complain constantly about [ __ ] like that do you know what it takes to do this right here you know right here no tell you how I feel write in your comments section Joe Rogan you can kiss my you know what that takes what do you have going that you have the time to just simply be that negative and do it in this world you know someone's just a mismanagement of your time yeah it is so valuable and I don't think people understand how valuable they can be if they use their time correctly yes now have you always been like this always be sausages oh my [ __ ] god man but always always really I find a light in every dark tunnel I will find a goddamn light man I hear at all you listen when I tell you to wait on my back it's so heavy of all the stuff that I deal with and I'm fine the reason why I'm fine is because I'm genuinely happy I'm happy and I'm not happy just because of the success success X is a bonus I'm happy because I truly know the definition and the feeling that comes with happiness I truly know it I felt it I felt it when I said yo what really makes me happy and I look at heaven and Hendrix and I look his oh I look at my wife I go yo I didn't have the family [ __ ] when I was coming up yeah I got one I got one look what I did look what I built these people depend on me I provide these people that makes me happy that makes me happy when my daughter comes up dad you're not only my dad you're my best friend no I'm happy that's my world so everything else from the outside that comes in your your your throwing [ __ ] at a at a at a bubble that can't be popped mmm it's a force field around me yeah there's a force field around me because what matters what really matters loves me wholeheartedly and when you had that and you understand that you're unbreakable so if you don't add to that force field if you don't make my force field stronger you don't you don't you don't get time for me my team heartbeat productions the people underneath my umbrella you're part of my force field you what I believe we all see the same things we want the same things so we march with the same beat you can't you can't shake that when you're an individual that seen that and understands that if you've never felt that if you have no idea what that feels like then it's easy to shake you that's why some people are easily broken being broken is not a hard thing it's not a hard thing so those that do get broken those that do get down those that do get depressed I understand I understand I don't I don't knock people for it mmm I don't not anybody for it what I also understand is that the encouragement that can come from so many can add value for those that may need a little push hmm that may need a little Amen pick your chin up it's so easy to be that positive reinforcement for somebody and add value it's so easy but some people choose to throw that aside and kick while you're down mmm I try to put out the light of positivity because whoever is out there you I don't know what it could do for somebody else but somebody else may just simply look at me say you know the way to he embraces his kids it makes me want to be a better father yo way to this man doesn't stop and await it every day he wakes up and he's just positive regardless of what's going on makes me realize that this [ __ ] ain't so bad the way that he gets up and says hey today is another day it's the morning let's all be better than we were yesterday somebody probably needed to hear that the more that I can give that out and I can take my platform to throw good energy out I'm doing my part because there's so many that thought the complete opposite yeah I don't want to be a part of that that's beautiful man that's and that's true I believe you it's not it's not forced right it's not phony yeah it's not fake this [ __ ] every day I hear [ __ ] every day it's very contagious too I had a lady I heard a lady right [Laughter] lady rolled out a window when you gonna make a good movie again did you see the upside was good what's that oh [ __ ] it's a movie it's one of my movies that's how us think I think it's a good movie I see that all right ma'am you have a beautiful day that's with such conviction like literally yeah I could have said a lot of [ __ ] like she rolled a window down you could tell she still had the crank things that I could say to you ma'am when you gonna make a good movie it's napping I got one out the upside you see the outside what's that oh it's a movie so it's out now amazing it that's how she chose to come out here I see it I'm Jesus to come at you with a negative I get it every day when you'll be funny again trying my best but trying my best if it's not working for you hopefully I do better soon what do you what what am I gonna feed into that and add water right why why for what yeah for what it seems to have been working thus far are you getting this positive attitude towards life from life experience are you getting it from books did someone teach you how to find this I'm getting it from the experiences and from the the real understanding of perfection doesn't exist don't exist Oh mmm we're in a time right now where people expect perfection you expect perfection I don't know where dust came from I don't know what happened that this is the criteria for living my true understanding is all right you got one life and then one life the goal for us is to live it to the best of our ability from the beginning so what said the end in the middle in the beginning middle you're gonna do things you're gonna make mistakes you're gonna [ __ ] up you're supposed to learn and then move forward with the understanding of what not to do and when you move forward life may get better it may not but somewhere along the lines is gonna click and everything that I went through back here was supposed to happen so that now that I'm here I'm able to go ahead with such a high level of knowledge and I can make other people better I can make myself better I could do more for my family something happens my dad is the prime example crazy drug addict in and out of jail life was very bad very [ __ ] bad my dad son got successful son then took money gave it to his dad here's your house here's your truck here's your monthly at this age I want you to live your life you know made mistakes you can't rebuild and correct the things you've done I'm your son I love you you can't go back in and redo you can't try to keep going backwards ain't about me you got grandkids mmm gonna be the best grand pop you could be for these grandkids that's your focus now where's this energy devoted to being a grand pop for the grandkids don't worry about me but something happened in your life something happened that took you in the direction to reap the benefits of your son's happiness and success my energy is now contagious nothing I hand it to you so now you're able to give that off to all these other people that you're around something happens and that's in every single life in every life I understand that there's a payoff for bad eventually there's a payoff it can't be bad but for so long if you got the strength and the understanding to realize that [ __ ] will change it will change it's impossible just like poker I don't know if you play poker or not I don't you play poker you can run bad forever but it will eventually turn around once you grasp the understanding of the game eventually it's gonna turn around blackjack you're never gonna be the casino but eventually you're gonna have a good run if you catch you run you'll do good get the [ __ ] out of there you waited long enough for it to happen here come catch it leave anything in life will eventually turn good no but this is coming just from your own personal experience have any role models that I'm up to you this way Nancy art did she speak to you like this about positivity and about my mom reinforced knowledge my mom reinforced you don't start things and not finish them you don't quit there's nothing that comes out of quitting besides knowing that you didn't finish we finish everything you started finish it if you're gonna do it do it to try and be the best not be better than other people be the best for you if you're in school and you're going to class I'm not asking you to get straight A's I'm asking you to get the best grade that you can possibly get give me a hundred percent all the time and I'm a happy mother when you half-ass me I'm on yes mom I want to do this I wanna I want to play baseball well then you gonna play my mom like that no more then why'd you start the season because I thought I wanted to do it then you gonna finish the season you don't quit there's other people that invested time and energy into you you don't just quit on people but I don't want to do it finish the season mom I want to swim then you gonna finish swim it didn't matter what I did I was never allowed to quit so now in anything I do when I pick it up a say i'ma start it I got to finish it it all don't work it all ate the best hmm it all ain't knocked out the park but I walk away saying I finished it I did it I did it right now I've been boxing I saw I saw you working out with Rico Verhoeven I'm [ __ ] first of all very strong kicker huge man okay he's a big guy too man good guy but I started in jeans I started it and I said why am I doing this I'm not gonna be a professional fighter I'm not trying to be a amateur fighter I'm doing the guiness shape alright then I start getting shaped I said you know so much that I don't know about the sport I at least want to make sure that I'm paying homage to the people that do this for a living by really understanding and learning it you know what I'm gonna get a real trainer I'm getting some real people to show me everything so when it's all said and done and I look back after my training I can go I gave it 100% and look at how good I got look at what I'm a product of a spar I go getting really yeah yeah just to feel it so I can say it you know well sparse Bryan Callen is this serious no it's me yeah that's me come on that's me dude that's me it's getting it to look at this who is teaching him uh his name is Biggs he's in Atlanta that's me learn I had a turtle shell within punches but you know he's a former Golden Glove guy really good to you were in a cup and everything when I was at the sparring session when I'm I grow tired damn yeah I got touched I got my ass whipped and every couple times I go guys worried about that all good I don't go crazy we had gear and but I'm not in there with guys that are trying to hurt yes I'm not in there was touching guys that have no concept of reality yeah or control like they're they're just helping me understand right here's why you have to keep yeah that is a problem with celebrities trying to spar like if you try to like you know that's why Mickey Rourke started getting all that facial surgery I'm serious he's part of James Toney Jesus lashes she's not a smart right here that's James Tony's a mean man and it's just not you can't like I don't I don't go in that space have you ever seen James Tony talk [ __ ] boys bars and there's some of the most entertaining thing you'll ever find on YouTube he's just he just won't shut the [ __ ] up beating your ass he's talking [ __ ] that's that's [ __ ] [ __ ] that's her and he's one of the best defensive fighters ever so he's really difficult to hit he's got that smells fresh and a in the world yeah I had a guy who's got any Mikey I'm sparring with Mikey Mikey hit me with three punches I thought I thought Mikey literally had like six arms this is the true story this I said I don't know what just happened but I thought I had my hands up in no matter where I put him he just tapped me he lets me feel it but not to where I might getting knocked out but I understand now movement I understand pivots I understand shoulder protection and that's my goal my goal is just understand cuz I can't do anything halfway okay if you try to fight somebody nope right nope I just want to say that I did it and I learn and I can move and I look the part cuz I put time into it well as you learn it too as you watch and you start get trained then you start to look at a guy like Terence Crawford or lumen Co and you go oh now I appreciate what you're doing because before you'd see like oh yeah I beat that guy up oh yeah he knocked that guy out but then you see like how he ducks under the left and fires back with the right you know Jesus this is precision it's insane yeah the the respect that I have for people that do that on a day to day is through the roof yeah and people that fight are in the most amazing shape in the universe yeah you're in the most amazing shape ever to move get hit for three to five minutes around come back do it come back do it and these fights go on and on and on I take my hat off to you yeah you get three rounds out of me I'm breathing out my butt I don't know where the air is coming from I'm searching for it it's a crazy way to make a living to money in your brain thank God I don't I didn't have to go down that route and you know to those that do just make sure you just put your body first like you said it's a it's hurtful when you see the damage that it can call us yeah we were talking about that earlier like seeing guys as they start to deteriorate and it's hard because nobody wants to tell him that either every I want to tell them they got one more good fighting them and let's uh maybe at the end of the year then we'll decide but right now we're gonna train hard and my stuff it's hard to cuz there's no option so they don't once you've established yourself as a professional fighter and you don't have an exit strategy you don't know what to do you know now at least thankfully because of the internet guys are getting podcasts and they're starting doing commentary shows they're talking about fighting and it's the positive you just found the positive that's the positive within the internet that is positive you just don't you just don't hear it celebrate it as much well the Internet's very positive for me I mean this is the show we do on the Internet I mean all not just podcast but YouTube videos and also information I know more because of the internet than I ever would have without it there's not a not doubt in my mind a more educated more aware person I want just the Internet yeah you get the things that you're able to find and search and I mean like you said you're you're able to self-educate yeah at a very high level these are the goods yeah we're talking about the goods so when you talk about positive Kevin how have you been yeah are you always like that it's this it's the things that I look at that are so easy you're not just positive though you're look crazy ambitious that's the thing that gets me about you in the rock for sure it's like the ambitions off the charts like I know your riches [ __ ] like when when do you think you got enough you don't have enough there's no doesn't know enough I don't have enough because it's not over it's all over it's not over so you know when when you put a cap on it you're putting a punctuation to it mm-hmm and the the the ambition comes from seeing what's out there that can be obtained you know when you see what's out there like what can you mean physical things like well you see what's out there when you see where people are really gaining wealth and knowledge from okay the business relationships that you're able to acquire the people that you're able to partner with and create certain things different revenue streams what I found is as a young black guy from North Philadelphia the biggest problem with the biggest problem within our community is knowledge we don't know debt debt is welcomed because it's celebrated that's all we know and I'm get that credit card oh my [ __ ] that credit card up and it is what it is they gotta figure that out I ain't got it after that yeah well you know what I'm getting student loans they gave it to me then after that [ __ ] is I'm figured out I put a cable bill in your name you put it in my name we can switch it up whatever they do it there let's just put it in someone else name its welcome the Hustle is welcome the knowledge of banks and what you can do it can't do is it's [ __ ] you don't even get it cuz you go to check cashing places reason like go check cash place because I don't want go through that ship the banks I'll trust that go right there to check heads please let me get mine let me get mine now take $30 whatever let me get it the knowledge is given so it's not to you obtain that knowledge and understanding that you go oh [ __ ] oh this is why you put money up oh this is this is how you increase versus decrease oh this is how you earn on your money oh wow I can gain wealth by investing in what the stock world is what how many people partake in a stock world and is there a part that isn't necessarily gambling is there a low-risk part these that's not the information isn't there so it's not so I got to a certain level and a certain group of people where I got it and now that I got it I want to give it so now I'm going to give it I'm gonna give it to the people that I know need it most and for me that younger generation of black people that don't understand the cool thing is in financial longevity not in a now it's not in the moment for jewelry not in the moment for the car it's in the longevity it's in building so at the end of the day you can say look at what I have look at what I worked for look at what I have that's mine monopoly is real but you have to have the financial understanding and I teamed up I got chased I never done something called financial fitness where's just about me educating people on money how to manage money how to how to be smart with your money but it's coming from a person that [ __ ] that money I didn't always understand it I hold in taxes before because I didn't understand it in the beginning I've had bad credit credit cards wouldn't take me because I maxed out whatever I've been there I've done it thank God I was able to fix it and get on the right path and now that I have the knowledge I want to give it could simply don't know so when you say the end game the end game is getting to a point where I've taken all the knowledge that I've been able to get over these years and really applying it and providing family wealth when it's all said and done the last-named heart is gonna mean just more a lot more than just Kevin Hart and comedy heart beat production it's got heartbeat digital your heartbeat ventures your heartbeat real estate there's so many things that the last-named heart will be attached to you real estate Kevin Hardin sell real estate a Bible stand by it but the reason why is because investment investment but but as you get older you learn this you learn it and and you know it's such a thing where you talk about black versus white you know a lot of people do that and and I flee so like there is racism racism exists I'm not unaware of that but there is a high volume of it that's that's non-existent people had a good people and when you can merge yourself with good people and follow the paths that you see that these good successful people have taken you then become a part of a world and group that nobody expected you to be it so for me I now have the position to do that and take all of these relationships and all this knowledge and take it back to the people that need it most I like to share I don't want it all by myself now are you doing this and the financial stuff you're doing this in videos you like releasing videos no we're gonna start we're gonna start financial fitness like I said with chase JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon very good guy to Shanda is well they're there helped leading in charge of saying how can we get to the people that we feel need the financial information of most so I said put me out there like let's let's go directly to the consumer so from colleges from high schools senior classes junior classes going out and talking to people before they go into the next stages of their life a lot of things that you should know so you're gonna speak to them and just share personal information are you gonna put this stuff online as well yeah yeah you'll be able to track and find content from it but I'm authentic so I said the best way to really do it is to put me in a position to be heard right I want to be heard like like it's a different story what I explained to the the people of JPMorgan Chase just when we were talking about this and as an amazing board of people that are just figuring this out and the best way to go and do it and I said you can't have the white guy that's never been to the hood or who's not from the hood or has no idea how the economy works here and what the real troubles are you can't throw that man in the situation to talk to people because I'm not listening to you from the gate because you don't relate I don't relate to you but throwing somebody in a situation that's lived it that's been in it that's been [ __ ] up in it made it out of it and is now coming back to help run it's a different ballgame and that's what I want to be and you know we have other voices outside of myself very powerful voices that are going to do it as well but the purpose is to align ourselves to really make a change so you can either be the conversation about making change you can be actual a part of the action to do it I want to be a part of the action and in doing it you'll also be able to understand my drive you'll get why I do so much you'll get why my hand is in so much because I have access to it and the question should be why not yeah the question shouldn't be yo why is he doing everything he should be why aren't you why aren't you trying to do everything why not well that's the thing about a guy like you that becomes contagious like what you were saying about surrounding yourself with positive people and people that are constantly ambitious and that that there's fuel to that you feel good about that that's what you're doing I can I can say seeing you here right we walked around you show me a facility loved it beautiful facility you talk to me about how your podcast is grown to where you are now the success behind it I don't leave here and go yo that's dope of [ __ ] I go hey I need to do more work on my radio station laugh out loud radio I own it it's mine I got a show on there but you know a Joe [ __ ] motivated me to do more I want to make sure that we understand really what's out here within his radio world because I just saw my guy in his space and I saw happy he is what success he has I don't want to be you or beat you I want to take this energy and apply it to myself that's the purpose of seeing yeah that's the purpose of being smart with your eyeballs you should be a sponge so I'm a sponge so I come here and I look at how you maneuver I look at your setup I not only bow down and congratulate you I leave and I said yo man I'm inspired dude that's dope as hell John can't wait in two years you gonna call me you gonna see my [ __ ] you remember I said I was inspired but you're gonna see what I let it grow into that's the proper way to get encouraged in motivating right as opposed to being a hater a hater and in competitive yeah i'ma beat you it's not a competition yeah I'm not interested in that either and I share the exact same feelings it's not a competition at all yeah so if you don't have people like that that are inspiring around you you might not know how positive it is and how it how powerful it is if you see someone that's on television or on social media and you see them it's hard to be inspired you don't know them but you're I can say look at your circle right and in your circle if the conversation is all about what we hate I can't stay in that song you see the new [ __ ] car came out okay this [ __ ] is ass I can't stand that [ __ ] car yo man I can't stay in this city what [ __ ] we even in the city what we eatin I hate that place it's so easy if you people don't even listen to it it's so easy to be the smallest [ __ ] in the world the smaller [ __ ] but if it's always hate can't stand these [ __ ] headphones why we got these headphones ladies like a horrible day why the buzz here [ __ ] that Stan it's hard whatever hate harwood how could you get a private table [ __ ] hate this [ __ ] [ __ ] chairs you're got better chairs I hate these chips it's so easy right so easy it's so easy to talk about yeah yeah and so many people don't realize that in a group you do it you ping-pong hate off on them yeah unless it's funny it can be funny just between yourselves trees yeah Patrice was it was one of the best funny one of the best 20 haters okay okay you bring up a good point comedic hate McConaughey yeah communicate one of the not one of the probably the best Patrice Patrice I remember when I would talk and if I was saying something you just hear what would you tell buddies what what are you talking about you like just the way you talk but what your voice everything about your voice just makes me want to punch you in the face we talking about when he would go after you - it kind of made you feel good - like if you're a comments especially if your comic like I called Opie and Anthony once I was talking them and Anthony anything he always has a gun on him Harry's a gun everywhere like he has a concealed carry permit and [ __ ] and I said to him I said do you ever worry that maybe you're putting out this energy and you're manifesting something like some sort of an attack on you because you're constantly dwelling on it you always have this gun and Patrice goes don't believe in magic don't believe me conjuring up the world he would go after you man it's like you just want to step back and watch I don't know but he got bill burr so Marilyn Oh bill used to get so [ __ ] mad beautiful thing about Bill Barbara would be snap at bill bill is the guy that's not funny where's the punch line in it there's no punch line he was so [ __ ] mad we the Comedy Cellar the days that we had there man bill burr Patrice O'Neal Keith Robinson Jim Norton Colin Quinn myself when I say we would sit at this table we would set this table for four to five hours and it would be nothing but beautiful trash ins to one another when I say they used to give me so much [ __ ] that's probably why it's so hard to bother me now the trash ins that I took from the age 20 to 24 and my young comedic career about how awful I was I had a joke I had a joke where to begin into my career cuz at the times let me preface this this was way in the beginning of my career this was a joke that I had about about little people midgets at the time and it's you know it was so bad cause I got robbed by a cross-eyed Mitch and the joke was I didn't know he was robbing me because I was with somebody else so he was looking at my friend but he was robbing me it was like a play on being crisis very very awful joke I remember telling his joke in a phone book comes flying on the stage put trees through a [ __ ] phone book at me I told him this isn't where the Boston comedy club people in a crowd tiny little place all you heard was and you sit back it hits the floor I said and Patrice said read it it's better material in it than what you're saying that crawls does laughs oh he's uh they all might say they used to trash me so bad so bad man do you alleged a retreat some news story a corporate trees jerking off at my house before this is I moved to LA I'm saying the two double partment I just got there Patrice coming out I said yo you need place ass I got two bedrooms you can come near it's my ex-wife at the time you know I come home it's like afternoon like Patrice mi yo you all but tres but race I go out in the bag open up the door I said his big-ass computer oh I see is his back hunched over so baby oil right and I come in on my door he'll get out get out get out [Laughter] he's so sick he's so sick that he didn't stop he was so concerned with finishing then he didn't even break stride and turn around and not really nothing he get out yeah you just saw his back hunched he came out like seven minutes late it was like my bad i may use come home [ __ ] for treatment I love him to death love him to death yeah he had the most don't give a [ __ ] of any time I ever met it was most 100% yeah good and bad yeah you know there yeah there was a good to it and there was also some bad you know a lot of things that didn't have been for Patrese probably could have happened but I think the the level of not give a [ __ ] yeah prevented some of those things well he was almost too authentic yes like his like gypsy that was it Charlie Sheen's roast whose roast was it that he did what he just torture everybody else on the roast and then he got up there and you guys the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] who is this [ __ ] oh my god Patrice has so many of those things yeah so many of things one of one of the best to do it if you if you are listening you're not educated I'm Patrice O'Neal just I ask did you just watch Elvin in the room one of his specials yeah some of that some of the funniest [ __ ] ever man and so insightful mmm-hmm he was so why the way people thought and behaved he would say [ __ ] like one of the things that he said that I I tell people all the time it's a it's a brilliant thing that he said it was forget what controversy it was but he was on television with some woman who was saying that you should never tell jokes about certain things you know and they were they were getting mad at someone I think it was Opie and Anthony about a joke and he said you gotta understand that all jokes come from the same place the ones you like and the ones you don't like the ones that make you laugh and the ones that make you mad they all come from the same place someone's just trying to be funny yeah like sometimes they just don't work I had a talk I had a talk with the I forgot her name I got I forgot her name but it was when I was doing all the promo for upside and they kept trying to break down you know where where where the jokes come from you know Kevin these insensitive jokes in that you told back then why what what makes you why would you even say those things and the hardest thing for me to explain I was like do you think people think of jokes and while thinking of them think that they're not going to be funny everything that you think of in a joke form you're thinking of it because you think you're gonna get a laugh behind it yeah the gamble is if I get the lab versus not get the lab don't get the laughs the joke was not funny if I get a laugh then I guess I'm on to something there isn't a bunch of thought that goes into the funny moments that we think may be great bits yeah I wish that I had a more logical answer to put behind it I said I don't especially at that time my career I just thought it would be funny the same way that some people think sir jokes funny the offer it's a thought comedians are constantly throwing [ __ ] out there yeah you're constantly rolling a dice and Thor [ __ ] out there had to [ __ ] you roll and good right it's not gonna be good the other hatten maybe all right maybe kind of good but it's all with the intent of entertaining it's not with the intent of being malicious it's not with the intent of sparking hatred it's all trying to make you laugh yeah that's it like it's it's literally that simple from a thought within the comedian's mind yeah nothing nothing else they kept trying to look for this like hard definition of why and it's like I don't have it I don't have the reason why I thought it would be funny and it wasn't that's the downfall that's it that's it it's it's and the thing is about this art form is that up until ten fifteen years ago there was never any discussion like this it wasn't so so when we developed and when we were coming up there was no it was just like and there was always guys that would push the envelope way too far I believe Jesus Christ you see his new bid what the [ __ ] yeah and you'd be laughing yeah you tell it to each other and yeah and it didn't matter what it was joke about murder or rape or what some people just use those dark subjects like they're trying to make us laugh yeah in the meetings the comedian's comedian there's always gonna be though well you just innovate you all do you know Brian Holtzman 100% yeah but in Holtzman's that guy 100% my funniest dudes and and and there's no way that I could say no some of the stuff that I heard me say remember Susan Smith that lady who drowned her kids I I know I know who you're talking about her and I know the moment but I'm not familiar with all all that involved Holtzman was on stage that week and he's like I heard those kids were bad I heard they set that close to the TV they never put away their blocks there we spilt their milk those kids will not be missed yeah and you were just like oh I in the [ __ ] like 9/11 when 9/11 happened they wouldn't let him on stage well Mitzi shore would not let him on stage four months after 9/11 she's like no way keep him off the stage I mean do you have you have the people just Sartre did they go for that they go for because they want to hear you howl and get back to the room do you know that like if it's you know comics are there in the back of the room they're gonna laugh their [ __ ] ass off at that chair and and you know it's weird because right now within a times I'm the comedian that chooses to be sensitive to the times you know I've made the choice to say I understand I get why you shouldn't say certain things why you should avoid this that or this I I understand and I am but then there's other comedians that go you know what I'm more staged I'm gonna be me and I'm not gonna do that because people are telling me that this is what I I'm gonna go harder yeah and do that that's yeah that just exists it just exists but I think it's easier to just say I'm not a fan that comedy isn't for me right you know what I don't I don't like the taste of this particular comedian so I'm not going to support a watch that comedian I'm gonna find another comedian there's more to my liking I'm going to go and just turn my head like I want us to get back to just understanding that you just don't have to support it yeah that's it well there's a lot of [ __ ] option it's very I mean there's so many today yeah there's never been more never been more comics I think about how many people were doing Netflix specials so many's never been more it's something so easy so I don't understand why there's a push to destroy which you just don't have to support it like I think it's just a bunch of people that have an ability to influence things now that didn't have an ability before and it's like they see a window and they want to throw a rock it's right there makes sense I think there's something that but I also think mm-hmm for us like meat for me in particular I really like [ __ ] up comedy it's one of my fits like I like Quentin Tarantino movies where people get shot and killed yeah I don't want anybody get shot and killed in real life yeah but I like [ __ ] up comedy yeah do you know Tim Dylan is yes I do pull up that [ __ ] video that him being mega Kane he is a savage dude he goes so hard but I saw this video I was tears rolling down my eyes I was crying and I was like okay this guy's needed we need this right now because during this political correct push you got this big giant gay dude who doesn't give a [ __ ] let me seize an animal watch this [ __ ] and we're going to it will be raised in captivity it'll be raised privately to be the greatest politician that has ever had my name is Megan McCain and I'm on a new show we have you see this to folks that [ __ ] riverboat casino catherine is talking about my father again my father was tortured for a hundred years for this [ __ ] country and he came back and he started seven wars because he's a gentleman [ __ ] you try I'm gonna wear my father's skin mask and I'm gonna primary from the right if you don't know he's wearing lipstick and a dress oh my goodness that's pretty damn that's out there they need that guy we need him it's out there we need guys like that I mean just talking about what we said it's like it's just it's very easy to just to just say you know what that's not me behind what is like for me yes advice humor is different I laugh I laugh there's a rhythm there's a viral video it is this old guy trying to hoverboard he's like [ __ ] he's gotta be like 69 70 and you know his grandkids there and he's like let me let me try it let me try it and this man gets on this hover board and takes if you saw Mike Tyson fall on a hoverboard his fall was worse than Mike Tyson's I've never seen somebody hit their head harder in my life and I didn't laugh out of wanting to see this old man hurt herself I laughed because it was stupid to try to get on his hoverboard in the first place and when he got up he tells the kids why is it moving like this this video everybody because that [ __ ] made me laugh some people were watching oh no no some people were watching to go oh oh oh another one just died [ __ ] laughing because everybody's humor is different yeah humor is different my humor is different falling makes me laugh okay we're you are falling makes me laugh I don't give a [ __ ] who you are if you fall in front of me no shot I'm holding there laughs there's no shot you don't stand a chance if you there's no shot that I'm not bust your ass something something's got to come out right falling is funny I still think it's hacky I still think farts are funny when my kids fart I laugh I still to this day it's the funny [ __ ] every me that goes that V you stick get out of it stay gas my little son 17 months when you fart I laugh something something within just ability to just be [ __ ] silly and GOP oh yeah it doesn't always have to have a meaning behind it some [ __ ] is just stupid my eight-year-old farts on cue she thinks it's hilarious genius she'll tell you that listen I gotta talk to you about something that's laughing she think it's hilarious she'll fall down the couch she can't stop laughing that's all you got it's your only bit as a kid nothing else but farts that's all you got that's all you've got to make people laugh you should enjoy it no he should think it's funny folly but falling is number one for me falling is number one my wife fell down the steps she got so mad cuz I didn't rush to help her I laugh she had a wine glass wine with all over the walls oh my god what are the worst Falls I've ever seen in my damn lap got up her shoe was on one step the shoe was all follow us funny I like it I don't laugh have fallen that much I just deal with too many injuries I've seen too many people get hurt it's not for you yeah especially old dudes fallen down hitting their head on Mike I start thinking about brain trauma and CTE long-term repercussions I'm near I'm right there with you it's probably better I'm right there with you there's the one that's going on today of this dude trying to come up the stairs on this other dude did you see that one the guy stomped them and set him flying like all I could think of is we don't see it in the video but that guy's head it's got to be smithereens oh my god he he had hit his head the way he fell back yeah you ever seen one of the guy who slipped and fell down a bunch of steps at the museum and falls in the water yeah he's going it goes in water Dumbo right you can't you can't beat that there's this dude this goes walking up the stairs and this dude's legs get the [ __ ] off my porch stop leave me alone and he keeps coming he's like don't do it don't do it and he got boom smack the way he fell back you know hands behind him that's all head that's all head first of all to not see that kick coming yeah from a guy that says it's sad but you also have to realize a guy that size is carrying all that weight of a donkey kick yes that's just caved in my got stomped but to not see it once again I always thought that about fat people but if you really really fat imagine how strong your [ __ ] legs must be strongly should ever yeah if you really get some power behind that kick and also if you've lost the weight you'd have these incredible legs that's a that's always a theory just it's Anthony but I was wonder if their needs are gonna shrink it wait what because you see someone from behind they're like 500 pounds like their knees are that wide I'm like okay is that the bone like is that fat around the bone like has the bone grown really wide too cuz your body does your bones do get denser if you do like heavy weight mmm like this if you look at like power lifter dudes they're do they're dense well part of it is not just their frame it's that they're constantly lifting heavy things so your body thickens up did you as you go but you know when when you know people that are larger make the the dedication to actually losing the weight and they stay away from like the weights and stuff and just do cardio it sheds off so fast yeah but he can't like I know I know a couple of friends of mine and lost like 130 140 pounds and like if now just fallen in love with fitness to the point where it's unbelievable like how their body is transformed and taking a liking to the new the new process that they're now in pretty yeah they get addicted instead of food they get addicted to being healthy exactly it's totally possible totally possible I've had I don't know how many people come up to me and said they've lost a hundred pounds plus because of listening to my show and having fitness experts on and diet experts and and just talking about staying the [ __ ] away from sugar say don't eat late at night yes that's eating stop eating in a certain time and give yourself more than enough time to digest Cal your calories start exercising well with me I think the thing with me that helps me so much as I'm not a foodie you're not I'm not a foodie man I'm just not you know it's boring gotta go eat with I'm just making a Turk that's it I'm literally just what is that yeah that's fine let me give that this baked chicken some brown rice that's fine I'm good you don't worry about eating healthy I'm a healthy eater because I'm not a foodie so it's not like it doesn't doesn't matter like I don't have the will or want to eat the bad [ __ ] so if you're passing by in-n-out burger nothing no nothing nah man I'm black fried chicken fried chicken you showed me a process Popeyes Roscoe's is good too but Popeyes really pops with Roscoe's yes man paradise Popeyes is [ __ ] I don't know what I don't know what's in that chicken better pretty damn good that's why see damn it do you like the spicy spicy set my ass on fire but I'm still gonna do it yeah I'm still gonna do it but I'm just not I I can consistently eat the same thing and be fine how is Popeyes the only one who figured out that red beans and rice is a great thing to have on the side no one else has it it's the best thing ever you know me why doesn't Burger King or McDonald's pop ha red beans and rice Popeyes is so good so good that when I was younger I was about 22 I was on a bike I got hit by a car right not too hard to where I was damaged but I had Popeyes in my hand like the bag I was riding on on my bike and holding it one hand bop got hit never let go to the bag Wow that's how good Popeyes is the bike everything else boom I'm there Popeyes I held on to it nothing was damaged still took home finish that meal that's in crud that's how good Popeyes is 100% so that's my cheat my cheat is Popeyes all day other than that I'm a consistory thurr I'm healthy guy so Dee take vitamins or supplements or anything I used to take multivitamins which inspired me to start doing my home like right now we got bicycle okay I'm starting my own supplement line vitae hustle love to vitamin that we put out but let me tell you why doe I'm gonna tell you why I'm even getting into this space so when I look at physical fitness and I look at this world I noticed that you know you have a you have a great one in need to look like everything around you that you see like everybody like everybody that's a part of this world they look so [ __ ] great and fit when they're talking about these products and the things they can do and I said you know what what I'm able to do and what I've done in my past I'm always bringing people together of all like in whole like there is nobody's alienated you know when I did my runs with Nike and before I got signed by Nike it was about bringing a bunch of people that never ran before and getting you guys to get up just come run with me just try it and you notice I got people out that never thought they were [ __ ] do it and we doing five miles we don't ten miles whatever it's just a group run something to say we did I said how can I create a product where I'm putting people in a position to understand there's a hustle in all of us that's what my multivitamin is about it's the energy is the recharge it's the ability to focus is to approach your day with all of the tools that you basically need it's not just about the physical fitness aspect it's about the health so if I can actually motivate people to take the step in the right direction of health with a line of supplements that are driven for the everyday individual that may not know or be aware but wants to engage but you're not in it to look like all these different people you're in it to be the best version of yourself how can I do that teamed up with a great group of people to create the best possible products that I want to do and I said I want to be patient so it took me for you four years to create about us and how many different products you go right now just by dose vitae Hustle is my only one right now so it's just a vitamin just a multivitamin but it's an amazing multivitamin is it a single pill or is it a packet but no it's a it's a jar I should have [ __ ] bought one good job a jar Jesus Christ so you like mix it in some stuff no it's a jar full like all pills yes pills okay um I'm gonna tell you the dope stuff this that's in it cuz I don't want to not say anything in and have it to where it's wrong so I always got it up on the screen man good Jesus Christ I get it hey you guys see it yep that's why you here we're gonna save that on my phone blueberry fruit extract scroll scroll back up there boron biotin beta-carotene vitamin A mmm-hmm what's all good [ __ ] it's all good [ __ ] it's more than a multivitamin I'll plan him in a it's good II what does that stuff Toco Toco trend all teletran out talk--i channels vitamin E family mm-hmm-hmm you ever heard of that Jim vitamin K look it up alright look it up it's a good thing too is that everything that's in it you know it's not only is it researchable but you'll see why like my biggest thing like as a guy that's not as familiar with the space I said who are the people that are they do it at a high level that I can incorporate into helping me build this product so I feel like you're never gonna do it by yourself you shouldn't try to do by yourself and you don't cut corners you don't go to cheap route you don't you don't do it wrong something you have to go back to do it again Brian so I went and I looked at the people that were involved with creating the quote-unquote best markets the best things on the market and I put that team together I put up a team like four to five I'm gonna tell you for years spent a lot of money developing this [ __ ] because it wasn't right in the beginning had to go back had to do it again wasn't right had to go back find out the other things they made other things better of things great had to go right go get it again go try it go do it again not right what else is out there what are we compared to until I felt that now when I launch there's going to be a place for my product in the market where people will understand that is exactly what I said it was there's no lying there is no you know false presentation behind the product Kevin Hartz multivitamins much more than multivitamin but more importantly it's something for everybody and more importantly it's to spark the hustle within all of us and it's the first there will be more but it'll be after I've mastered and done this at the highest level then I moved to product number two then I moved to product number three before you know it you want to see a [ __ ] whole line that Kevin Hart is slowly developed and that people can actually believe in because I'ma be a product of my own product that's the best thing in the world when you're a product of your product has to work for me before I say it's gonna work for everybody else so you take this stuff goddamn right I take it how long am I taking it I spent all this [ __ ] money I better take it I've been taking the the one that's launching now for about five to six months nice I've been taking this one I'm very happy because I actually feel the difference and the difference is just in the energy that you have with him day it's not an energy [ __ ] pill but I do feel a difference in my in my ability to last throughout my day like I'm I do a lot man I do it [ __ ] light so I told you I'm starting at that final 5:30 and I'm not shutting down to let 9 10 I saw a video once where you were taking a video of your your trainer passed out yeah like this lifestyle everybody very unattractive sleeper by the way shots out to Tim boss Ronald over line and one of the worst sleepers you have a seat so you take him with you everywhere yeah my trainers let me everywhere Wow everywhere so you train every day every day Wow every day Sunday's are light days like cardio maintenance is what we call it not doing the same thing all the time we switch it up love switching about love finding new things within Fitness to make it fun you never want to get bored within it so your your whole purpose is just to keep your vitality up keep your energy up just to keep it it's if I don't do it then there's a lag I need to train I need to do it because I I'm mentally so invested in it now that when I don't do it I feel like I've cheated myself in a in a day or a week that I've taken off I feel like yo man I'm not myself because when I am doing it I feel like I'm always I'm committed I'm committed to constantly building and reshaping and molding I'm working on me so when I'm not working on me I don't feel like my day that's supposed to be about me it's starting off with the biggest bang right this is my advantage to starting off like nobody else my day starts off before [ __ ] worms and birds get up I'm we're time to get up five five and that's when you start working out Jim 5:15 5:20 really 5:15 5:20 no food I don't eat I don't need before workout yeah I'm not I'm not I eat it before I workout never had didn't know what I am now because I'm getting older I'm more conscious of my body so I'm big with sports massages I'm big with you know making sure that I'm not putting myself in a position to get injured and overwork right so getting stretched you know trying to to do as much movement that as I possibly can like when I say I'm a little walking muscle I really AM so my flexibility is limited so right now that's my biggest focus so I'm about to start yoga trying to do that things that can just kind of keep me in a position to to not tighten up so I don't pull anything cuz I do so much are you gonna do hot yoga yeah do that [ __ ] all the time do you roll it love it amazing do it every week yeah only thing that's kept me from doing it is the smell and it's possibly you never that's the only thing that's kept me out of it I was like you gotta move past that yeah blessa I hear I get pretty bad sometimes it can yeah the place I go to is nice you just gotta make sure that the people take care of themselves well you know he'll be around smelly people I'll be honest I'm worried about myself I don't know what I'm gonna get especially if you get there early in the morning you know eat you won't worry about farting yeah but the people that eat breakfast yeah go they are letting off and everything I'll explain that the killer Mikey was talking to me about farting in yoga class I'm the guy can't be eating no can't be eating before that early are you going I like to go either 6:00 a.m. which is rare most of time 8:00 8:00 8:30 depends on where which place I go to - but you love it though yeah it's great for your head - it's 90 minutes of suffering you know it's hot it's [ __ ] you hundred five degrees hundred four degrees when you get out of there you feel like you did something really yeah and it just changes the way your body feels - in terms of your range of motion your flexibility all those weird connecting knots and everything just get opened up and you know my question is when you when you're just starting no yeah like like I will be is it extremely tough and a beginning again you just just gotta bring a lot of ice water just bring a big ol [ __ ] 64 ounce one of those of you know thermal flasks of ice water make sure you have enough water and drink enough water before it I'm talking put me in a bag yeah just start now I don't need to be what people could see me just we got like a section in the back yeah well you turn left you turn right everyone's gonna see you yes I'm saying can I be in a place where they go see me in the beginning like I don't want anybody to see you're athletic man you're gonna be fine you're gonna be tight it's gonna be difficult for you to pull off certain poses but you'll be fine I'm definitely gonna do it I'm definitely realize it's a challenge I'm definitely 100% gonna try your [ __ ] would you do too no that's next yeah that's next Justin I'm just on here listen this is where Rico was laughing because I say oh man don't laugh annotators I've never thrown a kick as I said whatever you show me right now is my first time doing it I don't I don't kick I don't know how to kick right so whatever you show me this is this will be me processing it for the first time and that day we did it we worked on and I think I threw a couple good kicks a couple good front kick and I said I said look after I'm done with boxing I said this will be my next test to learn how to probably throw some kicks and to move with my bottom half now that I've worked on my top that's my next hobby that's your next time you know jiu-jitsu is like that's the tough one in choice and you want to do that too I'm just this stuff as you get older you have to find [ __ ] to do right if you don't find [ __ ] to do you won't lose your mind you would get addicted to that I just wanna learn [ __ ] you would like it because there's so much to learn that's the thing about it it's a long long never ending never ending never ending journey of [ __ ] there's also there's so many different variations of each different individual move and entries into new moves and defense and then the structure of it is it's it gets so crazy it's it's super complicated my son my son does a my son is heavy into boxing in karate I got him meant to those so he he does them both so the reason why I want to do I just like to keep up with him so we can you know do things together I have trainers come to the house and we'll work out together he loves it so I just don't want to get left behind that you know we get 1718 which we'll say Dave I don't want that but we better back up when they start getting that much confidence I just want to be able to keep up and maintain so that's why I like to do it with them well it's good for a kid to to have that in your head which is not a defense confidence yeah you need that for confident it'll help you avoid things too well I tell my kids you know your last name puts a target on your back that you didn't ask for and we don't go and create problems but you should always be prepared for problems if they were to occur and if they do I just want you guys to know how to defend yourself so the things that I have my kids doing it just have the knowledge and understanding the worst thing is just not knowing you know they're growing up completely different than I grew up where I grew up you had no choice but to know if you ain't know how to fight that's your ass cuz you're gonna get tested there's no way around it you're gonna get tried you're gonna get robbed you're gonna get your bookbag take it it's am I gonna try to take snakes like it's the reality it's not a false reality that's real so if you're not prepared for it if you don't have any type of heart you won't last from where I grew up heart was everything and heart was sometimes saying I don't care if I get my ass whooped I'm not gonna be a [ __ ] I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie y'all to think that this can't happen so I'm gonna lose today but tomorrow I'm gonna complain and imma firin you imma talk whatever that moment was it was about establishing any level of respect that you could and I respect the eventually turned into friendship from all so my kids don't know what that world is like they're never gonna have it so as a parent I just have to make sure that you have all the tools that I can possibly equip you with because my president have the ability to provide me with it they weren't a financial space to to take me here and have this extra curricular activity or this extra curricular activity or learn it learn it then exist that is the big conundrum of successful Hebert can actually when successful people have kids the what made them successful is dry I grew up poor too we were on welfare and food stamps the whole deal when I was a little kid and that always stuck in my head this thought like we might not have enough food like I remember thinking that when I was a little like what if we don't have any food what if we run out of food my kids will never feel that they don't understand what that is and everybody that I've ever met that's interest came from some crazy struggle yeah when they were young yeah and that's the thing of your you and I and most people that are doing well in life you're raising your kids in a completely different way then literally what brought you to the dance and the first that's the hunger of not being one of those people that's left behind is what makes you successful in the first place and it's scary it's scared because you know my wife my wife told me she was like you know I love that you're not hard on your kids but you always make sure there's a lesson within your conversation like I don't yell I'll yell at my kids nothing's gonna register when I'm yelling so I tried my best to talk to you everyone I met my angriest I'm gonna talk to you so you can process this because you need to understand what's the problem you need understand what's wrong and what I had to really realize is they didn't ask to be born into this yeah you know I mean like that it's not their fault right that they're coming up completely different than how we were raised right and we can't have anger or frustration that's dedicated and thrown towards them because they got it so much better than what we had how do we make sure to be passed down to proper lessons so that they appreciate and understand and not take for granted right they have right for me it's tough because good kids good students their plot themselves in school they listen they don't do dumb [ __ ] yeah they want to play video games and stay up like any other kid there's no signs of a bad or crazy yeah and the fear and panic is that you got a note it bad and crazy exists right this fairy tale day we're in isn't real and at some point when I'm not around when your mother's not around when you have friends or other family on around you may get tested with the other side that's out here that you've never seen right so I gotta prepare you for the [ __ ] that you don't know exists I gotta take you to Philadelphia so you can see I try to show my kids where I grew up thinking that's going be like oh my goodness backfired it's so cool can we live here shut up [ __ ] you told my everybody here the car right now around you talk like this move your back this does not go well supposed to oh my gosh so cool dad is so different oh my goodness walked him around a neighborhood and it's like it's it's it's not a reality you didn't have grass and that's dad oh that's great would you play why were you here yeah when you hear these things it's so different man these were your steps the steps are broken how did you even play oh my god dad so wait we're weird was yours we lived on the top floor not the whole thing no it's this is three separate units so the top floor was me and grandmom's the middle that was somebody else that was a neighbor and downstairs or somebody else three different people lived in this one thing together y'all with strangers my own hands I don't know I don't know what's say it this part yeah right in the car but but when you see that that's the reality that you get hit with of I gotta make sure that I'm talking I gotta make sure that I'm constantly teaching yeah if I'm not and I'm not doing my part I'm failing you know took them to the neighborhood and showed them how stores are in the neighborhood it's what we got candy from here's here's what we would get little sandwiches from y'all walk we don't have no stores like this we can't walk this stuff it's a completely different world well it's a completely different world see people stand on the street corners what they doing they're big they selling drugs that's that's tough right there those are people that your dad still knows they've been there forever that's what you don't want to do but they're forced with these decisions just because of what they have to do you just need to see this dad is taking you here to see this drove them all around all around North Philadelphia all around South Philadelphia made sure they could see yeah physically see we go out the country we go to these resorts and islands before we go they're gonna drive around so you can see what exists before you get to this this is why we have to be good people this is why we treat everybody with respect this is why your dad likes to give everybody doesn't have I'm constantly beating my kids with that information because if you assume that everybody does you come off like such an [ __ ] when you're around people that don't yeah like how did you you don't also the advantage that they had growing up the way they are now it's such a rare thing and they don't understand it there's no way there's a small percentage yeah a very small percentage and that's something that I never want to let go of either so I was in the back of my head are you talking about how you know are we gonna have enough food you were coming up Chris Rock's joke is so great that he used to tell the hi he keeps a bag packed at the front door cuz he don't believe that this [ __ ] is his I truly believe you thin at any point somebody gonna go gotcha you thought you lived here did you visit joy and I was like it's so real because even though you have it you can't lose the sight a reality of where you once was yeah do you are you comfortable where you are now or do you still have those thoughts like this is this real because you you're at this stratosphere of Fame and success that's it's rare amongst the rare hmm you know it's like David Goggin says you are uncommon amongst uncommon men I will be a hundred percent honest and say I'm comfortable with the understanding of hard work brings great rewards this is a reminder of the hard work and dedication that I put into everything that I've done I'm not content because I know where I came from and I don't ever want to go back that doesn't mean I don't want to go back to the city that doesn't mean I'm gonna go back to the people that means I don't want to go back to living like I once was I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna help I want to inspire what a motivate I want to show people that there is a way out that there is a way to do more to get more to obtain more but I personally don't want to lose all that I've been able to get so I need to make sure that I do everything to keep it so I can't be content mmm so there is an understanding but I refuse to click on the switch of so even if you like even if you have more money than you'll ever spend for the rest of your life that's not what it's about it's about the inspiring people and the influence and constantly giving back and moving forward in a positive way and the only way you can do that is to stay active it's the story man yeah you know we're we're all writing a book what's your book look like mmm what is your [ __ ] book look like like your life is a bulk you got a bunch of chapters in your book but when they closed that book how good was the book how good was your book what was the ending to your book if the ending to my book can be so amazing because of all that was done the money all that was accomplished the first to do the man that did this he caused a merger between this because of his commitment and growth to this the communities were then given this made education this changed the way the schooling was Baba Baba gave books gave computers gave all of the things that can be associated with you and your existence become a part of the chapters in your book so my drive is about my book I was a New York Times number-one bestseller people will be done they did it I'm writing another book you ready to vote right now yeah what's it happened what happens if you are to Tom New York Times number-one bestseller if you get the two what happens if you get the three hey man how do books become successful who publishes them I want to start a publishing company heartbeat publishing why not mmm that's the thing all I'm doing is sparking the awareness and others to go why might why can't I create why can't I start why can't I be a business why can't I be a CEO why can't I be a tech guru why can't I [ __ ] create cooking products lotions since there's so much that some people just don't understand they can do let me be a spot to show how much how many different you don't have to do just one thing when it's all said and done my book is gonna be full of all this [ __ ] that Kevin Hart did cuz I never was content with doing just one two or three why not Kevin why are you creating [ __ ] health and wellness products why not I'm big on health and wellness why can't I why can't I try to create something that I filled is [ __ ] great and jump into a space that I'm already in I already give a hundred percent of me in this space why not why can't I talk about financial wealth why can't I go back and educate those that don't know why not you got time I make time well you certainly can but it's just so unusual that someone dedicates that much energy and time to giving back and getting involved with the kind of projects that you're talking about as well as be super ambitious with your own career it makes me happy yeah I could tell I'm genuinely happy discovery makes me happy like when you find different things to be excited about it makes me happy and it's weird when it clicks and schooldays to tell you all the time information is key read these books there's so much knowledge [ __ ] that book time to read that book I want to go home goddamn Sonic the Hedgehog I want to play I'm at level 3 I got something to read this book the information is stuff there it was forced down your throat at a certain age you just you just may not be receiving it correctly but then it clicks you may gain information differently and what you do with that information is up to you but people people have different roles they can go down the education wasn't my pick of choice it didn't do it for me but the knowledge in the common sense that I have naturally allowed me to gain information apply it differently it allowed me to grow smarts in so many\n",

      "is stuff there it was forced down your throat at a certain age you just you just may not be receiving it correctly but then it clicks you may gain information differently and what you do with that information is up to you but people people have different roles they can go down the education wasn't my pick of choice it didn't do it for me but the knowledge in the common sense that I have naturally allowed me to gain information apply it differently it allowed me to grow smarts in so many different avenues to where I said oh my god I found my niche I found my talent and now there's other things that my talent can take me to I don't have the all the knowledge and awareness but I can allow myself people to do that can teach me because now guess what learning is cool ya know what happened you don't have to do it anymore right it's its own you're a kid they force you into this school you don't want to learn but then when you get out and you realize like oh this actually benefits me does it make me a better person this makes me wiser it's 100 percent dirty and it's weird how it happens but when you go oh my god learning and knowledge is power mmm [ __ ] they used to tell me this when I was 10 my quads yes mom sons 10 11 years old I heard that [ __ ] all the time now I finally get it damn I'm about to be 40 took me all this time to get the goddamn code but I got it yeah it hits you at a different time mm-hmm and when it does be excited about it man you excited I'm excited about what 50 years I'm just now getting to 40 do you read books I don't read a lot of books do you listen to books on tape I have listened to books you know what let's do what Tony Robbins he's great Tony's a like I like his approach to giving information mm-hmm I like his attitude in general I like podcasts I like things that are real and out of presented in front of me I like information that I can go to the source and and touch and talk so I'm I and I'm reading a book it's a book that was recommended by such-and-such and the person who gave it to me and that's reading that book I learn more about the individual that I thought I already knew and now I gain more Michelle Obama's book great book great [ __ ] book I met her I talked to her I've been in the same rooms I've seen her success what is her book gonna be about mmm or read a book Wow I get it I get wise moving all the units that it's moving I get why women are reading his book and walking away feeling better feeling like they can't I get it oh wow hmm certain friends Dwyane Wade wrote a book focused on being a father his road to becoming a better father what he went through with his kids mother he developed a relationship than a bond with his sons like nobody else Wow didn't know that day that's dope I love how you put it on page there's certain things that you just want to know certain books help I understand why people read books I get what the information does you know the book that I'm working on now is all about the mental approach that you have with life and people not understanding that your biggest enemy is you my whole book is about you battling yourself people to understand is you against you the only person that gets in your way is you nobody else is you now when you write a book like this and especially about something like this this is like the way you've managed to navigate through life mm-hmm are do you do you write it out in essays do you do you do you have like bullet points that you you think about and then once you have those bullet points you had then you write on those how do you do it get on your phone it's all all voice notes and transcripts okay so because of your time you don't have you don't have the the time to sit and actually write mm-hmm so you need somebody that you can talk to for hours hours hours on it hey I need a hour but I gotta holler for me I got some stuff we want to talk to you about keV what what's that all right book title ideas subtitle ideas my dedication is my introductions within my introductions these are all powerful paragraphs and things that I was just said that are now transcript I get to go back and read it come see here there's no conversation at all every one of them um no conversation all and that's what the Internet has allowed people to do Internet has allowed people to skip steps 1 through 30 as a lot of people to jump straight to 100 [ __ ] you good job off take them down you should be dead oh god [ __ ] can't stand this whatever the hater the anger is when listen when listen ok when I listen and I can change I'm not that guy we're doing these weird things now that people aren't taking the time to sit and think through what I've understood is that what people are doing has nothing to do with me I should always be a step ahead because I'm thinking differently because I'm thinking about myself making myself better puts me in a position to make others better be the example not the problem the best way to take away the problem is to a lien 8 yourself from it these are business thoughts oh it's [ __ ] thought I can go through and just read this is a so you just have these philosophies of your life and you just just speak it listen just speak it dance so now this is all chance capable Columbus's that's incredible there's all [ __ ] transcript this is all Sarge's go back throughout the day and I read it and I say this is great this makes sense this didn't let me reword this I mean make sure that it's all flowing together and at the end of the day what's my reason for the book my reason for the book is make you better my reason for the book is to make people understand yeah we all agree we all should think that we're great there's no reason for you to not think that you're great if you don't think you're great ask yourself why why don't you think the highest of yourself when you do people have no no choice but to follow suit mmm you had no choice but to follow suit a lot of people they base it on their past they base it on the life that they've experienced up until this moment makes you better yeah it does make you back you better make you smarter yeah unless you say it yeah man that's what's interesting about it that's what's interesting about life you can hear a guy like you say that and then it changes your perspective and then you'll go out and take action that you might not have taken before I had a 585 on my SAT confessions I didn't take money confession they give you 404 put your name on a paper it's true story Wow I guessed a BAC a da I did abracadabra true story swear to God hand on my mother's grave a BAC a da I didn't care because there was a class trip that same day I wanted to go great adventure I was told they're not taking my SAT seriously but prohibit me from furthering myself in life that's what I was told at the moment I said damn maybe I should have maybe I should've applied myself maybe I should have been different when I saw my friends get their test scores back and they were ecstatic 800-900 960s everybody's going to college I felt like the biggest idiot in the [ __ ] world the biggest idiot in the [ __ ] world because the same people that I want to rush to go to great adventure with they had taken an SAT a week before they already got their work done mmm they did everything they were supposed to do so that moment of fun was real fun for them I was the only dumbass that didn't prioritize and take care of my [ __ ] so I'm the only one going to Community College everybody's else off to Villanova Temple University Drexel University god damn I just got left behind why didn't y'all tell me that y'all did it the week before how come you only tell me that we was serious about the college [ __ ] you ain't tell me I was trying to go to simple or Drexel all wait it's because my life isn't their life they're focused on themselves wow that they're doing what they're supposed to do hey jackass go sit by yourself and figure it out cuz that's where you should be lesson learn any opportunity given should be taking series from this point on because if not you can find yourself feeling just like this it's not I get down on myself a [ __ ] moment I learn from it I learned from it now I got to take a goddamn test you best believe I'm studying for that [ __ ] test cuz I don't want to feeling like I'm the guy mmm that didn't prepare now I got a story to tell my kids about what it feels like to be the kid in class that didn't prepare that's got the words great when they give all those grades back but it's because of my experience I don't look down on those moments you take those moments you make the best of them because their life lessons it's that simple you're saying it's positive but it's really just simplicity that's real real it's real and it's your life experience and it's your life's lessons 100% but the fact that a guy like you comes out and talks about it like that that's where it makes it really powerful because it's not just something that you learn from but now other people can learn from your past too that's what I'm hoping they'll look at themselves and they realize like we all start from a different spot you're not saying yeah this is why I'm so candid I'm so candid I'm so open they're there there is no like guys I'm fine with being an open book I'm fine with the good the bad ugly I'm fine being flawed I'm fine with all the things that have happened to me that have been exposed I'm fine with it all I don't hide from it I don't run from it I don't I don't avoid any of it I'm fine it's all right it's a bed that I made for myself I happily lay in it and I'll be fine figuring it out moving forward son don't stop for nobody man son don't [ __ ] stop so I'm gonna be up in the morning regardless that son is gonna be up in the morning regardless of how I [ __ ] feel and how depressed I am the Sun is gonna [ __ ] shine in the morning and the night time the moon gonna be there and you gonna look up these days gonna keep going by so do you let the days go by and look up and you don't wasted a year doing what what do you just pick it up alright I'll figure it out made some mistakes life goes on let me figure out life from this point I'm a life goes on type of guy you're a bad [ __ ] Kevin Hart very very very inspirational and I'm really glad you came down here and talked about I'm I'm more than glad I think that it took too long actually and this is the first of what will be many men I'm for sure I'm a fan too and I just think what you're doing is not just inspirational in terms of like what you've been able to achieve and who you are but also inspirational and how you're so dedicated to helping other people that means a lot to me it's very it's very motivating it's very powerful I wanna I want all your listeners know that it's not it's not at all no this is this is no way it could be you if you were doing that just for talk and be like listen just fake it and then become that guy because you're honest if you could do that and just say it and talk [ __ ] forget about whatever it's fake or not don't you guys trust me you will be seeing more the financial fitness is real this relationship with Chase and no she's making sure you put me in a position to give the information that I have and to the people that really need it that's the priority I will be sending more kids to college this year shouts out to 20 Robbins who's matching my donation so you know I think I'm going to end up probably probably having about a good million 21.5 where we take it we just dedicate that money and we just provide free education UNCF helps me as well that's a priority like I said this health and wellness side you'll see more from me vital so calm you know get a part of this hustle go get yours irresponsible on Netflix filming filming we about to come out Christmas there's so much so much [ __ ] going on man listen if

going to be huge portal is going to be massive portal is probably going to be dude it's going to be the tops I think I got to be honest with you I think portal is going to be the tops but hey let me get down there and let me hear from the hores mouth and interview them and be on the lookout for that content because that's the real Alpha down there my journey to find the next madic whether that be portal whether that be B2 Network whether that be Lorenzo whether that be polyedra Marathon thesis cetra Valar nit cubis core yala I'm hopping on a plane in about 2 and 1 half hours and I don't want to miss it cuz this truly could be generational games so you know what I got to go catch a plane [Music] boys you are seated at an emergency exit please review the responsibilities for emergency exit seat on the back of the information [Music] C this is Denver Colorado home of the mile high city and every year it attracts thousands of ethereum D5 Fanatics to the eth Denver event but this year things are a little different because I will be attending the Bitcoin defi Summit called Bitcoin Renaissance you see Bitcoin is entering a new chapter and the ecosystem is about to evolve this Summit will host some of the brightest minds of top prospects building on bitcoin will it be portal the secure ler 2 Atomic swap platform or will it be Babylon which is a trustless Bitcoin staking protocol or will it be Valar a native stocks D5 protocol that will have Perpetual contracts and Bridge layer one to Layer Two assets well we're about to find out [Music] you know rappers like to rock chain Rock blck chains knock them out the box man Key Ring full of water data I got to pray that my Ace sick incinerators blow the mind like a creeper one time in my is divine a find way to keep the power build in Che my chiping is starting to sweat from the heat crypto I coming a [Music] threat yo what's up bro hey bro good man good listen so let's take a seat okay let's go come here come so so check this out bro we're about to meet an individual who claims to be the CEO of merland swamp the most hyped decks right now okay so this is potentially the individual who is behind HHO and potentially Voya and we all know right now that is where the hype is at now he goes under the Alias Jimmy I don't know if it's the actual CEO or not but we're going to find out anyways okay we're going to meet this random guy guy who claims to be the CEO of Maryland swap at a coffee shop what do you think about that well sounds exciting if that's a real deal like and yeah that's like yeah he was one of the top uh High most high project and our community loves him if that's happens to be the real guy I'm up to it I'm yeah looking forward to it you know what I say right you got to shoot your shot so let's find out let's go bro hi there we we're part of a media company there's a big event down there we're just documenting [Music] stuff so listen the way we're going to do this is how we're going to attack this as I know the questions I want to ask him if this is actually the Merlin swap CEO I know what I want to ask him and that's number one is Merlin swap coming out with their own token and want the UK use case behind that you tell me what do you think what's what questions comes to mind well first we got to make sure how we know he is the actual founder like he's not he's an anonymous person I me I'm sure if he's going to be doing some sort of you know exchange of value with us or anyone he to kyc so if he's happy to reveal his he showing up to Cafe he's presenting himself in in front of cameras but another thing yes token is definitely of interest because uh since Merlin CH chain has set the standard and even Merlin saw for that matter with our community getting involved in whooo and the Voya a drop it's all about token and which and the new what we have seen recently is the more air drops more tokens it gets all the traction to the chain so we need to ask him that yeah no good points so it was from a reputable contact who tipped me on this individual saying that they are confident he is the founder CEO whatever you want to call it so that's my first question for him second question is what is going to become a Voya if he is you know if he has the answer for for that cuz Voya is the talk of the tongue right now um it has performed extremely well but I really want to know what's the use case behind it is it going to be part of this this swap de is it going to be part of its old thing um is it going to be trading fees whatever and obviously we have hooo going on too A lot of people go cuckoo for whoohoo right that's the slogan today so these are the questions that comes to mind I'm sure once we're talking to this guy um more things will pop up but those are the core fundamental of my um you know um um questions I've got the similar thing between this wah hooo and his own governance token which which it happens to be has he got any gamification token like a plan like you take certain token you earn rewards in certain you pay fees in different or and if he does have have to happen the governance token or utility token is that going to follow the uniso role model like what has done recently is revenue sharing with the people who state that that has changed the game for all the governance tokens before we to laugh about all absolutely we have to ask all these and yeah if he does have that token what's the best way to get get into it whether it's going to be a yeah a drop of a certain some sort and pre-sell or public cell Perfect all right I think we got you know that that could be the starting points and we'll see where it uh goes from there [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] see I think 3 2 1 going live are we live ladies and gentlemen here from Denver Colorado we have a very special guest for you guys that just suddenly happened we're talking about merland swaps co-founder Jimmy who took this interview under short notice we are at a random coffee shop he made a time for you and myself so we're very pleased and happy to have him here Jimmy thank you so much for making interview happen I really appreciate it thanks hello guys Jimmy's here so Jimmy my community is absolutely stoked for Maryland swap as you guys know we had Jeff on the channel and Jeff told us that Jimmy is um isumi Finance rather is the same entity behind Merlin swap could you confirm that Yes actually isumi is the official partner with Merlin Chen and M swap we provides a very uh strong and efficient D service de access service to M okay awesome awesome awesome stuff so what I want to ask you here now is there's so many questions that comes to mind right number one we want to know does mer swap going to have a token don't answer just yet and if so how do people get that token okay number two number three we have Voya that's making so much noise and Buzz in the community um and Bitcoin defi as a whole so why did you actually choose to go on Merlin chain it being such a new Protocol New layer to side chain whatever you want to call it why Merlin chain yeah first I'm a fan of Merlin chain and Merlin chain you know for now has the biggest tvl and a lot of uh commune members they are trusted loved by the committee members so that's why we want to build there and also I think Bitcoin uh unlike like we are in the East Denver right East Denver has a lot of D5 protocols a lot of Builders but for Bitcoin it's just the beginning the Bitcoin f is just the beginning so we are in the a very huge Voyage that's why we we breached the first brc2 VOA token to the morning token to make a fair a totally fair launch to the users air job to over 10,000 addresses is there going to be a token for Maryland Swap this is what people want to know and we're taking live questions by the way guys do drop your question in the live chat you we will ask Jimmy and hey we don't know what you're going to ask but Jimmy is not afraid of that neither neither of us so we're very um you know willing to answer your questions for you so Jimmy Merlin swap is there going to be a token yes or no yes definitely yes okay yeah okay and how is this going to take place this is the secret but we will reveal it very very soon could you could could you give us some Alpha here on that just on the channel we love breaking news on this channel okay you got you got to you got to tell us at least a little insights if you can no pressure it's okay okay I think just like all the other do you know the unique swap yeah they give a air job to the users yes I cannot say how much token or how you could get exactly air job from the morning stop but definitely there is uh you could you could get it in the next month in the in the March yeah oh shoot he slipped up he just said in March did you guys hear that in March I don't know if you meant to say that or it accidentally came out or none the less the cat's out the bag speaking of the cat just for you just for you speaking of the cat I I I got to show you something hold on hold on I go cucko foro wow what about w wow wow wow wow W this is what we talking about over here yeah speaking of the cat that's so bad yeah I need this church I need this\n",

       "[Document(page_content=\"what are the best layer 2 token Investments going into this next bull market I've said I expect uh layer twos to be part of the Mania in the next when everyone gets crazy about crypto thousands of l2s launching is where the excitement's going to be and and then I'm going to make my next video talking about the scams to watch out for that also always comes with the crazy bull but in this video I want to talk about where the best places to put your money are now I've invested through eight bubbles I've done well but I'm not a trained financial advisor and I'm not corrupt enough for Golem Gensler so do your own research now before I even get into this I want to I want to explain my investment philosophy and I just I just tweeted uh my Twitter Dave LaVine zerom I just tweeted this because I saw a video with two of the biggest Tech Venture capitalists Brad gersner Bill Gurley made a video and and I tweeted that at 28 minutes and 20 seconds Bill Gurley says the largest companies have the highest growth rates and they talk about this for a little while and at 35 minutes and 12 seconds Brad gersner says no one feels smart investing in the big companies investors have been grossly underinvested in the big companies who have done the best and they talk about this for 10 to 15 minutes which is something that I have said for a long time stop chasing the tiny new everybody wants the shiny new and I've been saying this and to me it just seems like this old hardened rule that is so obvious and I don't understand why people don't see it however they talked in this video about how this is a bit of a new phenomenon I was like oh yeah you know it used to be that the big companies became large and slow and were always disrupted and and it was almost easier to find those and it was but a and you know for me it's not a new phenomena because I've always invested in the tech high growth Tech and I and I think you know why is this the phenomena why do the biggest companies seem to outperform and my theory is that do these internet-based businesses where Network effects are so powerful Network effects are even more powerful than we understand because we see it in in large things that totally suck they just still maintain their lead so imagine if you have good Tech and you're the leader like so my investment philosophy in this video one of the best investments no it's not going to be the tiny new things launching in six months that I you know no it is not yeah the small new it's also not oh let's buy a 100 and hope that one of them and I could make a whole video and go on on why that method I The Venture Capital method buy 10 one of them makes the whole portfolio that method most Venture capitalists don't make any money and they suck first of all so I don't even know that that method works but the they just pick the leaders it's just so easy and it wins That's My Philosophy you don't like it go find one of those guys drawing lines on charts telling you what's hot this week and buy their course okay so that being said you know okay so that makes me boring thus I have no followers but so what are the largest um the largest and established layer twos now let me also say did I make a video okay so okay let's reverse a little bit so the largest Network effect protocol is ethereum itself right which is eth which is not a layer two but in your excitement here don't go and dump don't forget about the king I think this should be 60 70% of your portfolio at least 50 and even our horrible Bitcoin at least 10% okay so you what you got left and you may have some other crazy ideas you want to do but so you know 10 to 20% of your portfolio in these layer twos your crypto portfolio that is okay and so for me it's like well who the leaders so boring right we've got now there's two types of layer twos you got the optimistic rollups and the ZK rollups bottom line is the ZK Tech long-term wins however it's brand new sort of just launching and they're not the biggest the optimistics has been around for a while and so they are the biggest and don't forget the possibility for example optimism is one of the large early optimistic rollups maybe they convert a lot of things to use this by the time ZK Tech is so much better optimistic sort of converts and adopts that Tech somehow right because it's not about the best tech it's not about the fastest and it's not about oh my God it's one tenth of a cheaper Network effects is so important okay so the fact that optimistic was first is a deal the fact that they're the biggest is important okay but keep your eye okay so as far as the optimistic rollups go we've got optimism I mentioned which is op and you've got arbitrum a RB these are the two biggest right now I made a video I just posted a video that talking about L2 beat you can go there to see who are the biggest l2s I mean just you know follow it that way now watch out for ones that they is they sell some stupid meme coin with a monkey wearing a hat and so the whole chain is huge for a week that doesn't mean biggest means actual long-term big right you know consistently not just big for week cuz that happens um so you've got those two now with OP they one thing you sort of want to do and and these things honestly also if you're just you know you're watching this because you're interested in crypto you like it you own some Bitcoin and ethereum and you're in coinbase I don't think you play this game I think you got to be on chain for this like maybe they sell these tokens in coinbase I don't even know but to me if you're not on chain it's just you're not in crypto and what are you doing here with the 10 to 15% of your portfolio I think it's and and so anyways but if you're on chain and op you want to lock this up in the governance where you're you delegate somebody to do your voting for you because they've done some aird drops I think they'll keep doing air drops and you get more op for free if you do that and you use the token on chain you're going to get free tokens uh AR I don't think arbitrum has been doing that now another thing to note both of these systems arbitr and optimism are issuing their software so that people can launch version chains optimistic chains arbitr chains that are all on their software so it's you've got you know EBAs layer goes to optimism you know and there's all these other layers twos but on the optimism chain they've got a bunch of chains going and one of their chains one of their biggest ones optimism is base which is coin bases Layer Two uh I don't know if you do like this or it's like this but whatever coinbase and and coinbase itself I all you know don't don't forget about coinbase as a crypto investment I think it's a little different it is a stock um and I don't know that I would buy it today it's up it was at 75 for a while it doubled it's come down a little ah watch that truck don't buy things when they're going straight up but I have like Bas partly and coin coin base partly because it's part and they're being very smart about the layer 2 strategy okay so we like those two then you know polygon okay so polygon and and I'm going to post a video I just listened to this video I think I tweeted it also I'll put it in the description below and maybe I'll put this other tweet that I mentioned at the beginning in the description as well polygon started they were early as a a side chain to ethereum and other words what it's not an official Layer Two thing about layer twos is they take the security they uh it's as when it's fully deployed it's as safe as being on the main chain polygon just launched like another chain it's like almost you could almost think of it like another L1 but they built it to was so integrated with ethereum they call it a side chain okay so it's not a layer two but they have they acquired the two best zero knowledge proof companies brought them in I built this thing and they're launching I don't know they call it polygon 2.0 the tokens going to convert from madic to P um and it's going to be I think the leading ZK rollup um now people have looked and I've had people comment to me oh you love polygon and it's not even on the list on l2b it's not even Layer Two why do you think it's the best it hasn't really launched yet their official Layer Two but when it does launch and again if you're interested listen to the video I put in the description below where it's going to have like a data availab it's going to have a version of um uh like a Celestia built into their Suite of uh products it's going to have an like an Igan L it's going to have the reaking it's going to have um it's just it's it's the best it's and and they have a huge it's probably it's one of the biggest chains out there and it's going to move to it so I believe you know I I don't I usually don't like to be early the before in the predict but polygon just keeps executing I have this is for me I made this 10% of my portfolio and it's probably less the 10 at this point because it hasn't moved this price nobody likes it because it's not the story of the week it hasn't launched yet that's when I like things I know I'm so boring go to a guy who's telling you go to another YouTube channel hurry to someone who's telling you what's going up tomorrow it's like my my mother every time she asks about a stock or Tesla you like it well you know do I like it if it doesn't go up tomorrow she doesn't want to buy it for 30 years I don't have that long I need to know it's going to go up tomorrow never buys anything okay so uh um polygon did I want to say anything else about that um no okay now oh another point about polygon and even the rollups in general there's an issue that people talk about you know you've got and I and I talked about this in my other video uh Solana against versus ethereum video that I just made I'm going to make a playlist on my channel YouTube Dave LaVine zom and I I'll do a tweet that has all of the videos in this L2 series The One solot versus ethereum which really was talking about one chain to do everything versus you know what we're seeing on ethereum and all the other chains really is this it's going to be chains like this you know it's it's it's a fractal right of of freaking chains right I can do this all day and but the but the concern everyone's head is well what if I got something here I I want to communicate with this one you know I got a I got a decentralized exchange and there's liquidity on all these well that's it's you're splitting up your liquidity or what if it's even on another one it's over here and here and here this issue definitely is solved in the long run I'm a little little concerned that it could be one of these things oh yeah we're going to solve it it takes long much longer than we expect however it's looking a little bit faster than I feared a while ago and polygon specifically their thing when they launched they he was talking specifically they're going to have a feature where if you go and you launch your own chain app built right in you can tap into liquidity and all the other polygon chains right and op their model of having their their all these other little opans I think they're going to have comp I I think the composability is going to be solved maybe the composability is not as easy as it is on salana you can watch that video for the for the pros and cons there um but but there was that okay next the other phenomena we are seeing with l2s is uh you know what they call an app chain now these are just simply applications that not only say oh I want to go to the new layer 2 Chain because it's faster cheaper and all that but they say we want to have our own chain and one of my one of my favorite tokens when I say favorite it's couple percent of my portfolio it's one of these small maybe hopefully you know shoot for the mooners uh fracks right uh which is the fxs token they are launching like next month I believe the fraxel train no fra fraxel like fractal but fractal they're launching their own chain now I I already recommend and have held forever fxs um so now they're going to launch their new chain first of all launch launching their new chain I am not going to be the first one to jump onto the new chain okay and I don't advise everybody you can understand if you're in Bitcoin now you're early to crypto you're early to bitcoin these things are longterm stories I remember when I built my website in 1995 I was like oh God I'm so late it was invented in '94 didn't get on for a whole year right you know cloud everyone's going to move to the cloud this was invented in the 90s it's still if you look at the stats it's like percent of computing that has moved to the cloud like 25 you know some percent 30% of the Computing has moved to the cloud and that's over how many years 30 years we got a long way to go you are early you do not need to get on the new chain the week it launches and I understand if it all works out you're a little early make a little more money I'd rather be right and and and and and and for that safety lose take a little bit off the table then be the first one but have risk andoss disasters right so anyways this thing's going to launch and I'm going to watch it and as usual you know if after three or six months everything looks good everybody's and I'm seeing people are moving there then I will do the schlep because I've got staked fracks there's you you got staked fracks you've got fxs I don't know I mean I mostly just have fxs however you could have lots of things and to move everything onto this new chain is a whole schap that you don't want to have to do if the thing ends up not working out but anyways that is also going to be another story where certain applications get their own chain and then that creates some there's an air drop and then whatever Shenanigans everyone gets exciting and on the side I I wouldn't go chasing all that stuff you know and trying to be the first one and these airdrops everyone's so excited for an air drop it is free money but again it's just not just be in the big if you're in the big leader and you hold it for 5 to 10 years you're G to beat all of these monkeys running around chasing the narratives of the week guaranteed okay now also there is a lot more going on than I've even mentioned here and things that I don't follow gaming there's a lot going on with gaming the leader probably polygon with is it I IM immutable IMX or whatever and I just I don't do gaming because if you want to do gaming you should be getting on and playing the games and trying you know and I'm just it's not for me and there's a lot of there's going to be thousands of player two's launching and yes some of them are going to be amazing my Approach and and and this is what I advise most people to do a new layer 2 is launching and it's going to take over the world you believe great write it down and at it's it's going to go to the moon and then it's going to crash and you buy it in the next bubble probably cheaper remember the new hot thing that launches during the Mania right we're going to have the M you got the Mania and then the crash and here and so we're like here the stuff that launches and this one we're going to see lots of stuff launching between here and here you buy it two years later here right which might be cheaper than here so when the new stuff is all launching every week just yeah I everybody body's thinking again all these people who are chasing what's going to go up next week what's The Narrative of the week they're here and they're like oh my God I'm going to make money when I do it here and you're all going to get stuck buying the most here and you're going to lose your money it's what H it happens every cycle I've been through eight bubbles I've seen it over and over eight bubbles in my life not eight crypto Bubbles and crypto bubbles are the most fun and fast um but anyways so I wait I wait and I buy it here and maybe it's here and two years later you buy it here but also when all the Press is is flying and everybody's chasing and everyone's excited about the new L2 it's very easy to believe a bunch of and predictions that don't come true and so when you're buying later it's not only it's probably the same price sometimes times lower often lower but you know it's actually good if you literally like it when it launches and you watch this thing and for two years and you still love it it's pretty good I had that with polygon I didn't get it at the I was like yeah we'll see you know and I didn't like cuz they didn't have in a layer two right chain link same thing chain link I mean everyone was yelling at me when chane link was here and here and here I said yeah you know what you're I just well some people said down here fine I was like I don't know then it got up it when it was expensive I was like oh wait I like and now you know what I like chain link fine I waited so I bought it here instead of buying it here I bought it here right I lost a little bit but it was a threeyear weight and you know what there's aund different things that you could buy around here but but after the crash you only like one or two of them again better to be right than a little early um okay so that's all I want to say I'm gonna make one more video on this topic next video will be about what to watch out for because the scams and the hopium that is going to come with all this stuff I think it's just you know we've seen it all before you know the types with the with the scams and oh my God and get rich quick and all that stuff that stuff also follows a pattern and I think we're going to see that come and I'm going to give you some warnings on what to watch out for all right but anyway so with this video again uh well comment below let me know blah blah you know anyways I'm Twitter at Twitter Dave

      "[Music] Francis Dune uncensored that is right ladies and gentlemen I wanted to get this stream out before I hit the road on Hop On A Plane where my flight leaves in about 3 hours ladies and gentlemen so I am getting this live stream out we're going to be talking about Merlin chain we're going to take a look at whoooo and Foya and all those things we want to we want to spend our time and direct our focus and energy towards the next thing that could potentially go on my own chain and I know it's been a while since I've been going live I'm let's just pay tribute to this he the bitcoin's price hitting a whopping 54,56 if you don't think like like I know people overreact but let me tell you bro now is the time to get bullish let me tell you Babylon is going to be a beast hey babylon's going to be huge portal is going to be massive portal is probably going to be dude it's going to be the tops I think I got to be honest with you I think portal is going to be the tops but hey let me get down there and let me hear from the hores mouth and interview them and be on the lookout for that content because that's the real Alpha down there my journey to find the next madic whether that be portal whether that be B2 Network whether that be Lorenzo whether that be polyedra Marathon thesis cetra Valar nit cubis core yala I'm hopping on a plane in about 2 and 1 half hours and I don't want to miss it cuz this truly could be generational games so you know what I got to go catch a plane [Music] boys you are seated at an emergency exit please review the responsibilities for emergency exit seat on the back of the information [Music] C this is Denver Colorado home of the mile high city and every year it attracts thousands of ethereum D5 Fanatics to the eth Denver event but this year things are a little different because I will be attending the Bitcoin defi Summit called Bitcoin Renaissance you see Bitcoin is entering a new chapter and the ecosystem is about to evolve this Summit will host some of the brightest minds of top prospects building on bitcoin will it be portal the secure ler 2 Atomic swap platform or will it be Babylon which is a trustless Bitcoin staking protocol or will it be Valar a native stocks D5 protocol that will have Perpetual contracts and Bridge layer one to Layer Two assets well we're about to find out [Music] you know rappers like to rock chain Rock blck chains knock them out the box man Key Ring full of water data I got to pray that my Ace sick incinerators blow the mind like a creeper one time in my is divine a find way to keep the power build in Che my chiping is starting to sweat from the heat crypto I coming a [Music] threat yo what's up bro hey bro good man good listen so let's take a seat okay let's go come here come so so check this out bro we're about to meet an individual who claims to be the CEO of merland swamp the most hyped decks right now okay so this is potentially the individual who is behind HHO and potentially Voya and we all know right now that is where the hype is at now he goes under the Alias Jimmy I don't know if it's the actual CEO or not but we're going to find out anyways okay we're going to meet this random guy guy who claims to be the CEO of Maryland swap at a coffee shop what do you think about that well sounds exciting if that's a real deal like and yeah that's like yeah he was one of the top uh High most high project and our community loves him if that's happens to be the real guy I'm up to it I'm yeah looking forward to it you know what I say right you got to shoot your shot so let's find out let's go bro hi there we we're part of a media company there's a big event down there we're just documenting [Music] stuff so listen the way we're going to do this is how we're going to attack this as I know the questions I want to ask him if this is actually the Merlin swap CEO I know what I want to ask him and that's number one is Merlin swap coming out with their own token and want the UK use case behind that you tell me what do you think what's what questions comes to mind well first we got to make sure how we know he is the actual founder like he's not he's an anonymous person I me I'm sure if he's going to be doing some sort of you know exchange of value with us or anyone he to kyc so if he's happy to reveal his he showing up to Cafe he's presenting himself in in front of cameras but another thing yes token is definitely of interest because uh since Merlin CH chain has set the standard and even Merlin saw for that matter with our community getting involved in whooo and the Voya a drop it's all about token and which and the new what we have seen recently is the more air drops more tokens it gets all the traction to the chain so we need to ask him that yeah no good points so it was from a reputable contact who tipped me on this individual saying that they are confident he is the founder CEO whatever you want to call it so that's my first question for him second question is what is going to become a Voya if he is you know if he has the answer for for that cuz Voya is the talk of the tongue right now um it has performed extremely well but I really want to know what's the use case behind it is it going to be part of this this swap de is it going to be part of its old thing um is it going to be trading fees whatever and obviously we have hooo going on too A lot of people go cuckoo for whoohoo right that's the slogan today so these are the questions that comes to mind I'm sure once we're talking to this guy um more things will pop up but those are the core fundamental of my um you know um um questions I've got the similar thing between this wah hooo and his own governance token which which it happens to be has he got any gamification token like a plan like you take certain token you earn rewards in certain you pay fees in different or and if he does have have to happen the governance token or utility token is that going to follow the uniso role model like what has done recently is revenue sharing with the people who state that that has changed the game for all the governance tokens before we to laugh about all absolutely we have to ask all these and yeah if he does have that token what's the best way to get get into it whether it's going to be a yeah a drop of a certain some sort and pre-sell or public cell Perfect all right I think we got you know that that could be the starting points and we'll see where it uh goes from there [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] see I think 3 2 1 going live are we live ladies and gentlemen here from Denver Colorado we have a very special guest for you guys that just suddenly happened we're talking about merland swaps co-founder Jimmy who took this interview under short notice we are at a random coffee shop he made a time for you and myself so we're very pleased and happy to have him here Jimmy thank you so much for making interview happen I really appreciate it thanks hello guys Jimmy's here so Jimmy my community is absolutely stoked for Maryland swap as you guys know we had Jeff on the channel and Jeff told us that Jimmy is um isumi Finance rather is the same entity behind Merlin swap could you confirm that Yes actually isumi is the official partner with Merlin Chen and M swap we provides a very uh strong and efficient D service de access service to M okay awesome awesome awesome stuff so what I want to ask you here now is there's so many questions that comes to mind right number one we want to know does mer swap going to have a token don't answer just yet and if so how do people get that token okay number two number three we have Voya that's making so much noise and Buzz in the community um and Bitcoin defi as a whole so why did you actually choose to go on Merlin chain it being such a new Protocol New layer to side chain whatever you want to call it why Merlin chain yeah first I'm a fan of Merlin chain and Merlin chain you know for now has the biggest tvl and a lot of uh commune members they are trusted loved by the committee members so that's why we want to build there and also I think Bitcoin uh unlike like we are in the East Denver right East Denver has a lot of D5 protocols a lot of Builders but for Bitcoin it's just the beginning the Bitcoin f is just the beginning so we are in the a very huge Voyage that's why we we breached the first brc2 VOA token to the morning token to make a fair a totally fair launch to the users air job to over 10,000 addresses is there going to be a token for Maryland Swap this is what people want to know and we're taking live questions by the way guys do drop your question in the live chat you we will ask Jimmy and hey we don't know what you're going to ask but Jimmy is not afraid of that neither neither of us so we're very um you know willing to answer your questions for you so Jimmy Merlin swap is there going to be a token yes or no yes definitely yes okay yeah okay and how is this going to take place this is the secret but we will reveal it very very soon could you could could you give us some Alpha here on that just on the channel we love breaking news on this channel okay you got you got to you got to tell us at least a little insights if you can no pressure it's okay okay I think just like all the other do you know the unique swap yeah they give a air job to the users yes I cannot say how much token or how you could get exactly air job from the morning stop but definitely there is uh you could you could get it in the next month in the in the March yeah oh shoot he slipped up he just said in March did you guys hear that in March I don't know if you meant to say that or it accidentally came out or none the less the cat's out the bag speaking of the cat just for you just for you speaking of the cat I I I got to show you something hold on hold on I go cucko foro wow what about w wow wow wow wow W this is what we talking about over here yeah speaking of the cat

      "next month in the in the March yeah oh shoot he slipped up he just said in March did you guys hear that in March I don't know if you meant to say that or it accidentally came out or none the less the cat's out the bag speaking of the cat just for you just for you speaking of the cat I I I got to show you something hold on hold on I go cucko foro wow what about w wow wow wow wow W this is what we talking about over here yeah speaking of the cat that's so bad yeah I need this church I need this church speaking of the cat that's out The Bag Man wow wow Soo is inside sorry Jimmy we didn't have one for you um you know everybody wanted one so we ran out I do apologize but um we'll definitely have one delivered for uh to you um so whooo man who made a lot of noise yeah you know I some mem coin I'm not going to ask you utility mem coins or meme coins I think it was a really great way to kick things off um it also provided a lot of um utility right I forgot my mic also it's okay yeah it also provided a lot lot of um um not utility but liquidity rather at the beginning right um and I think you know that was a good head start and I liked how they Incorporated it if you wanted to get the Voya you need to whole hoooo right and that was a really good play on your part so what I want to ask you is could we see something in the future where who will be involved in certain other a drops if you can't you know dis close out that's fine but I feel as though who is going to be a part of Maryland swap moving forward that's just my guess I don't know you tell me or if you can if you can't yeah uh like you saw like when we air jobs a VOA token whether you you like uh deposit money in the morning seal or you have the Bitcoin in your wallet or whether you have hooo or even whoo LP token you can get the air job ah even LP yeah yeah yeah yeah so whoooo and whoooo users or whoo LP you can get a lot of oh I mean the loyer token when we do the air job so in the future for the token whether it's a mem token whether it's a rc20 token if they have large community we will try our best to give the more utility to it so don't worry about this part and also I saw some official website I don't know who made it actually like last time I check on the de screener I saw the Twitter and website yeah I think that's the power of commedy I love it that's the thing it's a true Community meme coin where they're taking the initiative right and they're doing this marketing they got a Twitter account now and all this oh that's amazing hey speaking of community right we're making some merch you guys want some next time I need this shirt I will buy one I know right oh my God how could we forget that we're is stupid it's cool it's cool okay so I want to ask you something about we saw on your was it yeah on Merlin swap Twitter account which was um Merlin starter I believe right is that an official partnership uh actually there will be a lot of Ideal platforms launching on the morning Chan because morning CH you not have a lot of users oh sorry was that Merlin chain sorry yeah it could have been uh there are two of them um I think Merin Merlin started partnered with Merlin that was Merlin chain yes Merin chain there's another one called Merlin pad which Merlin there was a tweet tweet from Merlin chain saying that do not accept every anyone with Merlin there' be project launching With Merlin Dash with named with Merin so make sure my my my apologies I thought that was from your account there sorry about that we are live you guys know how it is you get the real deal no no edits here they love it they love it okay cool so let's talk about Voya I think this one here surprised a lot of people in terms of its price performance for sure yeah absolutely and the immense trading volume it has now could you drop any Alpha on Voya what is the outlook for it what is the utility my guess is I was thinking Launchpad to invite projects on to the U you know to trade on Merlin Swap and all mer chain but probably that's not the case could you give us any insights to um Voya please yeah actually to be honest Voya is out of our imagination yeah uh in the first place I think that Bitcoin layer to like the morning they are built for the Bitcoin ecosystem so we just want to make an experiment to bridge the BRC 202 you know trading on bitcoin main is quite Co costly and also very slow but you know if trading on uh morning swap is quite it's very smooth and very efficient so it's a experimental token we Bridge the brc2 to the morning chain and air of fuel uh totally fair LUN users but the result is out of our imagination people I think Bitcoin is um the guys from Bitcoin is different from other ecosystem they love the fair they love the transparency so I think uh Voya is a huge success uh in this perspective and in the future Voyage just like his name a voyage we are not just it's just a beginning yeah so in the future I think uh Voya is as the first bridged the brc2 token it will be adopted in many maybe the uh many more decks much more decks and maybe some launch pads or some other utility and and more and more scenarios because they are loved and trusted by many users so unfortunately guys we have to wrap this up the coffee shop is closed um Jimmy took this under short notice as well before we wrap this up Jimmy anything you want to tell the audience anything at all they they can expect or whatever uh yes I think there are two things first one keep an eye on the morning spot there will be more more and more campaigns and some good opportunties for you to try to explore the Bitcoin to make Bitcoin fun and also to explore more opportunities to do something on morning I cannot to say toil almost did yeah but just to keep an eye on the morning swap Twitter and also the uh Twitter space or some other medium Channel and there will be more uh I think uh good things for you and second is that I think in the like you said uh uh there be some M token unlocked and distributed to the uh to the people so there will be huge liquidity on the morning uh morning CH and also on the morning slap there will be a lot of things to do so if you are a user of the morning seal you will get the M token and you can use it to get more yields or more utility on morning St we will let you let you know what's his Str awesome guys you heard it from the Mad himself Jimmy co-founder of Merlin swap um a lot of alpha has been shared guys we're done here thank you so much Jimmy for your time and we look forward to the success of merland Swap and since he mentioned uh new announcements coming in March which is we are just counting days 28 29 March we almost pushed him but he's he's just holding it back for two more days okay it is we're done thank you Jimmy thank you Jimmy thank thank you yeah make sure we're off we're off yeah okay awesome was was good man that was really I love oh it's a surprise you me no so honestly what did you think of that interview man I think it was fantastic considering the uh settings in the Cafe closing at the last minute and get he answered pretty much all our questions I I think he actually dropped more Alpha than I anticipated you know he told us what we can expect with Voya what we can expect with uh hoooo with its utility also Merlin swap will have a token as well and there will be an air drop so there's no more speculation right it's just Alpha now and it's facts now coming right from this freaking Channel bro and what he's told us is it's in March it's around the corner so it's not too far away it's very soon and I would expect that as he says who who's going to have utility that's going to be one of it to hold it to get this token as well but we would see as long as we know there is a token coming from R swap there is an airdrop coming there is utility for hooo that's all we need to know man so you know the the cement is poured the foundation is laid it's just time to move in the couch and the TV into the house and flick it on and kick back bro [Music] for guys we are here live in Denver Colorado as Bitcoin smashes 360k you are in the right place at the right time for those who believed in this decentralized Finance currency you know that how you need to tap pat yourself on the back you listen to your intuition you listen to your gut and this is why you are in this position today you brushed off the fud news you shook off all the negativity from your mom and dad you know rappers like the rock chain Rock chains knock them out the boxy Ring full of water day to I got to pray that my Ace sick incinerator blow to mind like a creeper one time in my circus Divine to find way to keep the power build in check my achievement is starting to sweat crypto Anarchy becoming a threat you know we are in Denver Colorado for the Bitcoin Renaissance event and Bitcoin just smashed 60k guys want to tell you if you are still holding Bitcoin congratulations to you pop yourself on the back because you just brushed off all the fud all the negativity you just showed your neighbors your parents your friends every who said that it was imp possible that this thing is not going to do anything but go to zero congratulations to you because we're on the way to Smashing over 100k very soon at the end of the year maybe before we got a lot of good content for you guys a lot of top TI projects that's going to be building within the bigcoin ecosystem and we can't wait to drop that content so make sure you stay tuned drugs doing on the street de gole today is February 28th tomorrow is the EV 29th right that's why we flew down here so there is quite a number of different projects that's going to be there um the one that really stands out to me is Portal B2 Network we've already covered on the channel and I think we should actually hit them up as well I think people will love to know you know further insides to the buzz 3 phase three and how that will work I really like what Lorenzo is doing um Babylon is actually hosting the\n",

      "street de gole today is February 28th tomorrow is the EV 29th right that's why we flew down here so there is quite a number of different projects that's going to be there um the one that really stands out to me is Portal B2 Network we've already covered on the channel and I think we should actually hit them up as well I think people will love to know you know further insides to the buzz 3 phase three and how that will work I really like what Lorenzo is doing um Babylon is actually hosting the event sponsoring the event they're offering Bitcoin staking so now people could stake their Bitcoin and they won't have to give it up right so when bitcoin's going up in value like right now we're almost at the new alltime freaking High corre um you know people could stake it and still get the benefits of yield you know so that's pretty cool but another very interesting project in my humbled opinion is Valar I think what Valar is doing you know they're on Stacks ecosystem one of the more longer lasting you know one of the first Bitcoin l2s and they're creating this One-Stop defi shop right so farming staking all these things you're going to have a swap Dex but more notably right they have different volumes I think volume one and volume two volume two is going to allow people to have 20x leverage trading on Perpetual contracts I think that's super interesting and I think they're going to also have layer one assets bridged over to Layer Two our Focus tomorrow is on the D5 protocols the spe the ones you pointed out um portal being one of them which I happened to message the CEO Chandra and he's responded back he he'll try and catch up with us speaking of stacks we might even they've got the nakuru upgrade coming so if he get get time to speak to M that would give us one of the ogs in the AG he's going to be a hot commodity trying to get a hold of that guy good luck but we'll try our best you know there's so much talk about Nakamoto upgrade sbtc I think there's more um rumors and people are second guessing but it will be great to hear from him he'll set the record straight so getting a hold of that guy is a whole different story so for me again portal um V Babylon man I definitely want to talk to him those are my top four that I would love to get just even two minutes each yes so yeah how we do that we'll see but tomorrow's the day we got today the plan let's see what unfold going to build the next who's going to build the next what the next um the next level no the next um the next Frontier for Bitcoin who's on the new Frontier next who's going to be bringing building the next what keep me [Applause] going That's it man this is where the rubber hits the road this is what we came down for it's lights camera action now right Soo much brain power Under One Roof it's going to be it's true battle of L2 yeah Battle of L2 is [Music] be the Battle of el2 is is the show you you want to ask them for because that's something much needed in the space not everyone can show up in the live venue and even if you are there you need that reply think cuz a lot of things go over the head uhhuh for me it's more like um we definitely need to set the tone right we came in for some interviews we're genuinely interested in what they got to offer um but we also want to tell them that how hey we got a show and we want you guys to come on cuz there's a lot of confusion like you said and it's the TRU you know a lot of people don't really understand this even the people in the ethereum side the ethereum defi cats remember like the guy we met in the elevator today the look we got uh yesterday he was saying oh what are you he for like Bitcoin def5 he almost did like a laugh like right I'm like he's like oh you meant orinal no Bitcoin def5 right it's a L2 built on top of Bitcoin and it's meant to be more scalable efficient and convenient he's like oh you me orals so I think it's not just like viewers it's even other builders and other ecosystems and I I know the feeling you got when he gave you that Smur like the look like you you now you're used to that look anytime someone gives you that look you I'm in the right place I'm there because I'm early yes cuz everyone's walking this direction you getting in other direction that's when they know you're early that's for sure the reason I showed up here and made a quick decision I would feel the excitement in your voice when you said we have to go there because you don't you again cuz you were almost you know one of the first persons who jump in that space amongst the people I know like hardly I know in the BRC space I agree and you want to be the same yeah which you have been doing online V2 Network say other guys interviewed you are trying to do it but this is where the said right we saw this was going to be a TR we knew was going to happen called it last year called it last year um and sure enough it's it's come to fruition so we had the B2 Network right which is the most they say they're the most practi Lev to right that's their slogan um and then from there we got Jeff Merlin chain which is arguably the top one right now that came as a surprise 2K by surprise with the amount of TV and everything else happening yes and then we had the deck which was M swap yesterday here which was pretty much out of schedule but it was cool that we captured that yeah especially in the settings we had the time limit we had you made it happen that was good bro imagine dude imagine if the all time high is Mets when we're in this damn conference then they got the after party bro dude I'll be the first one with my shirt off I first my shirt off I don't give a [ __ ] [Music] be all right all right bro let's do this let's do this let's get it [Music] [Music] so welcome everyone to bitcoin Renaissance 2024 we are very excited to bring this conference we're trying to bring the best of the Bitcoin world and the P world so I'm happy to introduce Alexi hey everyone thanks for being here so can we get like a little bit of hype you guys are excited to be in Bitcoin Renaissance 2024 there go okay thank you I I like that energy so uh Alexi like there's like so many events in Denver so what are we doing here early morning we're painting Denver Orange it's not eth Denver this year it's bigin Denver yep anything else you want to say anything else well sank I mean we've seen the Bitcoin results orals was Bitcoin scripa moment if you had told me two years ago we're going to have nfts on bitcoin I would have laughed you out of the room and I'm a bitcoiner myself now we've had ordinal we have Bitcoin as one of the largest chains in terms of nft volume Bitcoin held an alltime mind process transactions and we just only got ordinance now imagine what's going to happen this year we when we bring everything else back to bitcoin s what do you think I'm here for my reaking points man like reaking points airdrops and what's the next 100x project in Bitcoin we have some of the amazing speakers all over the world here and we have some keynote speakers talking about Bitcoin Bitcoin ambition finally I feel like this year Bitcoin has had the highest impressive year-to dat performance pretty much this is the best performing asset and we have the most sticky user base in Bitcoin so if you're a builder you're a protocol owner if you can't build on bitcoin and be successful it's going to be harder out there so we are super excited to see who wants to build on bitcoin we have an amazing panel we have amazing speakers and we want you to interact and ask questions one of the protocol would be we don't want it to be a monologue so we want to open it for the audience so please raise your hands be interactive and that's the plan well I think we should get started with have Rockstar speakers let's get started thank you guys thank you for the speakers thank you for coming so really great to be here as Alexa say we're going to convert what uh East Denver to bitcoin Denver amazing all right there is a way of earning Y and that is sing thank you very much the story here is about bitcoin's Evolution change in regime for Bitcoin and you know historically bitcoin's been an island it's been on its own doing its own thing the question is can it be integrated into the greater uh crypto ecosystem Sony what are your plans to engage with Bitcoin uh overlap Bitcoin Cosmos what's the relationship look like there yeah um you know I mean I I started working on Cosmos six seven years ago because I wanted to build the app layer for Bitcoin I saw this Cosmos thing and I was like oh this makes so much sense a network of app chains and all and then you know Bitcoin is the money app chain and like Bridges bu a secure bridging to all of these other app chains and becomes the money of this ecosystem um you know it took a while to get there uh building out the cus ecosystem but you know now the cus ecosystem is like probably like number two or number three like you know probably neck and neck with salana as like the largest uh ecosystem uh but Bitcoin is like you know obviously the biggest digital asset that can be used to to secure stake chain so uh with bong we're trying to build towards that and kind of give people the framework you know with Cosmos SDK to build the chain and with a cosmos Hub the validator set to run it yeah so uh for me like you know as sun was saying that uh and you also said that Bitcoin is the granddaddy of this whole industry right due to bitcoin everybody is here including ethereum and uh you know Bitcoin is an island uh which is not connected to this like broader web 3 ecosystem as as you would and uh what Babylon is doing is using Bitcoin you know restake Bitcoin to secure proof of stake chain and what we believe is that evm as a virtual machine has a lot of adoption it will it can attract a lot of developers from the ethereum community into this Bitcoin Community chain let's move to uh David quickly so what does it mean to you that you have the likes of polygon\n",

Community chain let's move to uh David quickly so what does it mean to you that you have the likes of polygon Cosmos you know now using your technology to you know leverage Bitcoin security for other blockchains yeah so I think uh I completely agree with what uh fol was saying is that in some sense you know uh Bitcoin is the first blockchain but all these more recent proof of stick blockchain is really a way to sort of get away from The Limited capability of Bitcoin and to do something else I think uh Bitcoin is a content is the world and uh I think folks on this panel we're we're continuously building on this uh I remember we used to have this narrative making distinctions between Bitcoin crypto and blockchain right but uh but now we see the convergence of uh all these efforts together and uh in the past few years uh we uh put in uh tremendous resources in building out web 3 related initiatives and products and okx wallet is as as we understand the only wallet that support uh four uh different uh signature PS uh for Bitcoin as well as cosmos I think like this like season two and so like the like Orin is like definitely from the West like initially like Udi and like a bunch of other friends and so we basically have this a whole orinal um just a fry like in like early last year right like we have like a just like a hidden Army and behind the entire like orinal inscription BRC 20 and so like those are all in Asia and then so um like primarily in like China and then so thank you for Jeff and then so for the whole okx team and then really make a big push for that like what we have seen is um when it comes to the ETF law right and like ETF law is actually for now it's like uh like do not institution it's like do more like smaller checks and then from like West retail and when it comes to like the E retail and like the easn retail they have been like dejing like all the Bitcoin nft like since like like early last year and so that's why unfortunately like like the two of the biggest D from like last cycle like Doan suu like they're all Asian um so we Asian we love to D and so we are very open-minded when it comes to like you know like anything that's like Casino related I love the way my body's moving to the be I love the way close me I the way mying [Music] the all right ladies and gentlemen we are here at the Bitcoin Renaissance event with M the co-founder of V these guys are going in on the uh Stacks ecosystem they are the One-Stop shop for your def5 products whether you want to farm stick automated um Market maker and other things as well in their V1 and we we talking about the V2 which I'm very excited about cuz they will be having 20x Perpetual contract leverage trading is that correct yes along with a potential bridging layer one assets to Layer Two is that also correct um no we are not building the bridge uh we will use Bridges available in the market uh but we will use the asset Bitcoin once it's bridged as sbtc onto STX we will be able to use it as collateral in our P deck eventually in the future vers so that's when the Nakamoto block upgrade goes effect yeah so after Nakamoto upgrade uh they launch sbtc which is Bridge version of Bitcoin on Stacks it's one of the most trust minimized version of Bitcoin out there so we will use it as a collateral in our P deck awesome so what can users expect from Valar when it comes to your V1 is that um date announced on when that will happen well it's it's coming very soon it's uh I can say for sure it's coming within next 2 weeks okay on on on Main net the version one the version one will be uh world's first unop V2 inspired amm on Stacks it will also have the features of farming staking and it will also have a launch pad because we want this ecosystem to grow this ecosystem has very less number of projects yet so we want this ecosystem to have more number of projects so we will have a launch pad uh for people to to be a part of this ecosystem and launch their projects awesome so my community members they love Stacks right man we love that guy um he's one of the Godfathers when it comes to the l2s I'm sure they'll want me to ask you why did you guys choose Stacks we started building Val last February in 2023 uh at that time there were only two l2s live in the market stacks and root stock we decided to go with stack is because we we like the smart contract we we like the clarity language that they use it's a during complete language and we also like uh the upcoming Nakamoto upgrade and sbtc uh which which they were building at that time so that's why we chose T they're also battle tested too they're ble tested they've been around for quite some time and they have a great Community we love the sex Community exactly awesome stuff okay so in my research correct me if I'm wrong the way your deck will work I think is it a is it a a a or something like that automated Market maker yeah automated Market maker but okay so it's not an automated Dynamic Market maker no no no it's just automated Market maker it's same same way how unisoft V2 functions okay okay so let's talk about your token the Valar token right ticker Valar yeah okay what's the use case behind that the the Val token is a utility token uh people will be able to stake V token and they can get fee discounts people will be able to stake V tokens and they get tickets for IDE launch pad projects when they go live in pbex people will be able to stake Weller and get access to more leverage so 20x Leverage is is on the higher side and we want uh we want our users to be more safe so 20x leverage will not be accessible to everybody so you know if you st well you will get access to more uh more leverage on the pbex and in future version yeah and and in future versions We will have more utility coming to Val interesting interesting I really like the aspect of having the Ideo because this space is just going to Blossom and new Innovative projects is going to launch and I'm sure they'll like the stacks and to have you guys launch that there and have the utilities awesome um so anything else you want to tell people that they don't know about V any air jobs you know people love air jobs yeah we we had amm incentivized tested last year in June uh when we go TG we will do air drop to those users and uh we will have a incentivized test stand coming for per deck as well I think that will happen in Q2 of this [Music] year guys we're talking with David here co-founder of Babylon as you guys know we did Cover the test net and how to participate in that so thank you for doing that thank you thank you very much for covering our test net no no my my uh my pleasure you know quality project like yourself how could I not now David could you please tell the folks how this Bitcoin staking Works cuz a lot of confusion is out there okay so um you know Bitcoin is a proof of work chain and so maybe that's the confusion because Bitcoin is proof of work and sticking is proof of stake right so uh how does it work right so a you a Bitcoin user a Bitcoin holder uh has this Bitcoin sitting in the wallet nothing to do no yield to generate Idol so if you Idol why don't we do this you can lock your Bitcoin okay a Bitcoin sticking Bitcoin scripting language allows you to lock it for a certain amount of time while you're locking at we provide a cryptographical technique whereby you can provide security to approve of th validator okay right so you can delegate it to a validator like figman or block demon or something Val these are all valid that are running our B centralized right now no no no no no centralized all decentralized nice you stick to specific valid that you like right and the validator works to validate a chain and uh you get yield based on the native chain Yi generating process interesting so could we talk about that yield I know Cosmos is an ecosystem there that you're going to be yes integrating with correct integrated with so what the type of yield in terms of the tokens people could expect to get cuz with with with normal staking you stake that token you get that token but as you just alluded to that's not how Bitcoin works so what can people expect in terms of yield right so yield um in general depends on the economic activity of the chain that you're securing right so in the case of uh Cosmos uh atom is the base asset right so you can think of Bitcoin as like an additional security to give more security to the cosmos hub and for the effort it will get some atom yield atom yield which the bitcoiners can take keep the atom because of the B market or sell to at them to convert back to bitcoin if they want to Goa could we see any other ecosystems integrated within Babylon yeah we are actively in discussion with other ecosystems uh polygon is one of them we're talking to but it's still early stage yes so we don't have any formal uh collaboration or arment with them now right but uh yeah we work on it last question when do you think we can see Babylon full full send on Main net months from now weeks yeah so um we are thinking in uh probably next few months we will launch the main net maybe we'll do a phase launch nice like Igan layer so Ian layer did launch uh main multiple phase main night launch we'll probably do something similar this is going to be a project that's going to be recognized and everyone's want to hear about them so we might as well get used to them early thank you so much D appreciate your time Awesome event awesome I'm the best only in the store I'm popping them tags AIT with chasing for the cash grab I don't really want to that [Music] bad we are\n",

I'm popping them tags AIT with chasing for the cash grab I don't really want to that [Music] bad we are here with the most exciting project in my humbled opinion in Denver at the biton Renaissance event we're standing here with Chandra who is the co-founder of portal correct guys this project is going to give you Goosebumps like it did me when I was reading their documentation in my humbled opinion this is literally a decentralized exchange 3.0 okay and don't take my word for it he it from the founder himself so chandro please tell everybody what portal is we'll start off there so portal uh thank you for the great introduction by the way portal is the uh bridgeless trustless wrapperless cross chain decks uh first of its kind and uh the reason we built it is because the biggest problem in this space right from the beginning has been custody poorly secured custody to be exact all the way from Mount goau to FTX to bridge collapses worm Hall you know I don't want to name names but all of the problems in this space date back to poorly secured custody so we set out to eliminate the problem of cross chain custody once and for all and so with portal it's a layer two cross-chain Atomic swap Tex so you can have uh you can be seamlessly swapping Bitcoin for E for USD yes eat Layer Two eat assets um you can you have a custom channel for brc2 sign aals so you can have rapid cheap trustless swaps between all of the set above uh assets and so we're very excited you know we want to prove that defi can be built on bitcoin Bitcoin does scale and you don't need trust assumptions or uh third party custody to be able to do this the way I see it again guys when you're using a decentral decentralized exchange when defi on ethereum came out about 3 years ago right that was pretty cool to do this in a trustless way right but that's within the network within the network no what portal is doing is doing this throughout Network across so when people go to exchanges they like that experience of trading maybe Bitcoin to ethereum ethereum to BNB now correct me if I'm wrong is that how this will work on that is exactly right so the gold standard for user experience for cross chain exchange has always been the centralized exchange yes so you have one transaction which costs money and Confirmation Cycles right like that's you moving money to The Exchange and then everything is super fast and cheap because it's just State changes in their database we replicate the exact same thing and in my talk at 3 p.m. I'll actually explain how it works uh hopefully I'll have enough time to go through all of it but but um you have parody feature parody Rec centralized exchanges and no trust no custodian and you get additional privacy guarantees because we use MPC in the privacy so explain that a little bit further so if you're a liquidity provider into any of these AMS because of the multi-party uh computation that we do in the middle there is one signature that comes out none of your public key identities are actually revealed so you speaking of liquidity providing on Portal it's not a a um automated Market maker it's a it's a automated Dynamic I think Market we call it the automated Dynamic Market maker because there's an amm on each chain there's an amm on bitcoin there's an amm on ethereum there's an on E layer 2os and all the supported chains they actually all interact inside of the portal node through a coordinator and then you basically don't have to form custom Channels with anyone you just interact with the Hub and you trade whatever you want you provide liquidity you stake but you never give custody to anyone guys I'll tell you something right now there's a lot of like these Layer Two side chains coming about but portal is something that I see the end user feeling very grateful and and and it's useful to the end user now I have to ask you this question right right so I see that how portal is something that could potentially disrupt the need to use centralized exchange that's the that's why we set up absolutely but the thing I think what people like about centralized exchange Al although there's risks involved is it's super fast yes what is the the the throughput with uh portal it's lightning scal to the next level so these are lightning Network you mean lightning Network scal to the next level okay all offchain messages super fast I mean you're basically limited by the network bandwidth and Network latency that you can't avoid right but other than that there is nothing happening on chain so it's all offchain and basically at the speed at which you can pass messages between the Hub and the trader or the liquidity provider so it should be exactly like a centralized exchange cuz that is our gold standard like I said when we set out to do this the Northstar was you have to reach user experience speed uh cost parody with the centralized exchange additionally you give these non-custodial guarantees and privacy lastly let's talk about the notary chain what what what exactly is the notary chain so the notary chain is the uh consensus chain that are these validators that are part of the custody Hub uh non-custodial Hub that are actually signing these swaps they're called the delegates so the LPS don't have to be online they don't have to sign every swap these uh validator consensus actually signs the swap so the Traders don't have to interact and find the counter party um and then that consensus mechanism is on the validator Chain um that validator chain um runs on Cosmos evm it's a proof of stake chain interesting and um it's very fast and then we inard security from Bitcoin because we actually use the Bitcoin base layer for non equivocation gotcha um when can people expect mainnet um we hope to main it ready by March by March yes yes guys that's like in that's tomorrow end of March let's yeah yeah there we go awesome stuff is there any um test people can participate in absolutely you can download uh portal test net on test flight right now okay um it's P2P swap the amm upgrade will be in a week to 10 days okay and then after that it'll be basically uh Audits and M not ready this sh thank you so much really love your project man really love your project [Music] that get it one day that get it one day I it you know guys we are live from Denver here in Colorado we're standing by with Matt founder of Lorenzo and um as you can see right here it's a liquid staking on bitcoin so I can interpret this the way I see it but it's best to hear it from the founder themselves so please tell us what exactly is Lorenzo of course so if you know about BTC staking basically like all of the POS today high performance POS today are like bued on this collateral base or staking base right so the security are based on like how reliable and also the amounts the cap like total cap Market of these are collaterals and Stakes you can put into it so the question is why don't just use Bitcoins to stay all like to Prov like provide Securities to all of these POS there are mass mass like massive massive like adoptions we can see with that first is like the overall coso systems kind of like like can benefit from that massive massive ecosystem there also yes and also like Bitcoin L2 is like a huge huge Market because like with this Bitcoin ETF and with this like appreciation of Bitcoin assets and new interest and mass adoptions of Bitcoin new users are inflow capitals and inflow we need defi we need Bitcoin else to like to keep and to utilize these like new users and applications and new capitals flowing in so why do we should trust this Bitcoin l2s is because like they're secured by BDC sh security they provided that they secured by these like POS like of of like buil on top of BDC staking at the same time we do not want user just to lose liquidity after staking to it of course you're going to get like high rewards going to very highend rewards when you're staking po like bdcs 2dc system what are the rewards if they were to stake so these all these rewards from the l2s from the l2s yes like transaction fees all of these like tokens being created interesting so you're partnered with all of these l2s so we are partnered with bablon and baron with partner with all these like L2 so we are working together and we are also like providing TX stxs to make everything easier to mass adoptions of BDC L2 building on BDC share security right so you so Lorenzo could be defined as a protocol we can Define as a protocol we're are liquid staking protocol we talked about BDC staking right now we talk about liquid staking when you stake to e todc ecosystem at the same time you got liquid staking tokens which is St BDC where you can use just like normal rc20 like BDC packed assets in all of the these these that's that's very interesting because as we're seeing Bitcoin price going up right now most people say hey let me you don't want to lose the at all it's like highly volatile kind like real estate right you don't really want to let go of that home you want to rent it out that's actually very fascinating so for the people out there who are used to ethereum and they know how this exists on ethereum exactly how does this happen even on bitcoin like the inner workings right is it the same smart contracts or how does that work okay that's way more complicated I can tell you that so A few things here so once it's like you need man like how do you stake right you need to know like how when users come through us like how do we manage staking to all of these POS so we have like these MPC and also like NPC accounts on bitcoin and\n",

      "who are used to ethereum and they know how this exists on ethereum exactly how does this happen even on bitcoin like the inner workings right is it the same smart contracts or how does that work okay that's way more complicated I can tell you that so A few things here so once it's like you need man like how do you stake right you need to know like how when users come through us like how do we manage staking to all of these POS so we have like these MPC and also like NPC accounts on bitcoin and also like a governance kind of system around it to safekeeping it and also we also like providing opportunities to retail stakers which is to say you can like stake very small amount and we will do the aggregation of small amount of bdcs on top of like the BDC Network so we have the mechanisms around that the next question is like how do we manage like who is taking to like what POS chains there is a mapping between sters and also these POS chains right so all of the information needs to be recorded and also like what tokens do you like get as reward and how much of that like who what's the distribution what goes to whom these things needs to be managed on this like smart contract so these Bitcoins see I wanted to take two Bitcoin right is this locked up somewhere it is locked up on the Bitcoin Network in our custodial account nice yes and we will like St it to the bablon and at the at same time we have app chain on Cosmos which we will like manage all these like St BDC issuing and also like calculating your staking positions and calculating your rewards and distributing these like rewards to you when can folks actually start staking on um Lorenzo so the staking was actually that's a very good question thanks for asking that our staking portal will be open sometime in March we are like kind of marketing it we're trying to like get beating it to get everybody knows about it and our test net will be ready in about 2 months on Cosmos yes and uh so the main n will be launching we we need to do some coordin with Bon but we're trying to like launch both on very interesting we covered Bon's Tes that just went live yesterday we be to do that so that's my question to you um your token what does it do number one I believe it's a governance correct me if I'm wrong and number two is there going to be an aor draw for people who will um participate in the test night I'm glad you asked so there are a few different utilities for a token governance token for sure like you mentioned you got that we have D to like arrange everything so token means power you got power to have a say in our ecosystem that's one thing and also two that also means like staking opportunities so you can gain yield on top of that there are many different like cases for do that first for our validators you stake BDC so you have like higher chance to become like validating generating BS and when you stake more offer native tokens you have like higher rewards you got like higher reward rate so you're saying obviously we all know validators get more rewards because they're contributing in a bigger way than holders right or or stakers so you're saying or correct I'm wrong if you were to hold your governance token does that give these validators more yield yes exactly very nice exactly that's one thing and also like we have like some long-term plans for our just native like token holders you don't have to become validators but if you stake or a native token so you get a higher chance to get like we get some sort of it's not technically dividends but we're going to do some profit share with all for token stakers and token holders so that's also something we're planning to do in accordance like with the air drop you were talking about yes we will have air drop I got to put you on the spot exactly I'm going to put you in the spot right now okay how much percent of the supply is going to the airdrop is that allocated as yet or that number is not um final the number is not final but like for me my like like the Moto for my life is like if you want to do business you have to share profits with everyone supporting right so it will be like a big enough amount the proportion of the total tokens I'm not just going to say I'll take 1 2% it's not going to happen right we need to share all the like the profits we need to share like of the ownerships of things with all of the people supporting us so I guarantee you it will be like a big enough amount and I will keep you updated with all these numbers thank you so much I would strongly recommend right just because Merin it's it's it's a really good like a lot of transactions happening there and I think if you guys can incorporate something with them that'll go a long way we are trying to work in that out as well awesome awesome Bon's a big player too so I'm very happy to hear that thank you so much for your time look forward to sing some Bitcoin with you of course yeah looking forward to that as [Music] well that was a long eventful day what's your take man I mean what do you think of it all it was a long day but uh think uh efforts were worthwhile so we made good connections learned a lot uh yeah excited to be here so I would definitely say man you know Lorenzo seemed very interesting to me that how they're built on top of Babylon liquid staking it's a little bit different to that of what Babylon offers which is also sticking their own right um but nonetheless very interesting also I would say portal bro portal is next level bro with people see this thing go live and they use it they'll understand how it's like a DEX 3.0 it really is right it reallyu is right and again I don't repeat myself but to have the ability to do this in a decentralized way across different networks opposed to within that same network is a revolutionary bro um and the token burn and the mechanics behind it they got game theory bro dude portal give me some of that now truly it's it's a project with good fundamentals and fals with the token Theory all the the game theory they have with the burning and the revenue shift Valar too Val is interesting those sleep on v as I said I keep saying that but I mean that I like that how they know what they want to offer um The 20x Leverage teams to be it's not my thing but I can see there's a market for that right especially going on to stocks too and already proven ecosystem and such um I think that'll do [Music] wonders you know they the crackheads they they yeah they doing I know I seen that they got a at maave a Bitcoin yeah in Denver yeah there's a I we googled it there so actually you can you can withdraw your currency from Bitcoin through the through the through the ATM yes so if you know so you search up the closest ATM you find the address you send your Bitcoin there and they'll give you the equivalent in USD bro without the [ __ ] bank so the problem is the bank it's the government right like we pay them to do all these things but they're failing immensely like look at us bro look at the state of the [ __ ] economy it's a joke so but that's that's bad ass like 10 years ago Bitcoin was probably like got 200 bucks right that's what that's what I'm saying it if think it was less than that it was like $78 yes 78 yeah exactly how much is it now bigcoin dude it's 6 [ __ ] 3,000 63,000 63,000 so you you can't buy in unless you buy no but this is right but this is my point okay Bitcoin does not have inflation issues right right and the problem why we're all poor is because they just print unlimited money which means what it's inflated it's it's not it's not valuable wow that's the problem man right so my point was back in 1971 when it was backed by gold you could not print more than what gold um Holdings you had correct so they convinced the you know the country and saying hey look we could print more than you know more gold reserves that we have because Y and Z everybody agreed on it and now we're all [ __ ] poor right so Bitcoin is literally the opposite and even better not only from the from the um um um you know the supply and how it decreases in circulating after every four years but it's not even control by human beings it's controlled by math and computational power so I can't bribe you as a governor or as a politician to do me a favor right right so it's so much other metrics behind it that it's a purest form of generational wealth and um um a reserve currency I could have probably bought at least you have your own taxi [ __ ] company right now 20 cars that that night oh no yeah there's a very there's an epic YouTube video of this guy I forget his name the guy that g to bitcoin first uh Da Vinci and he was telling everybody on YouTube this thing is a dollar and he said it's $1 right it's dude it it sticks in my head today he was saying buy at least $1 worth and if if you don't like it I'll pay pay you back yeah yeah he's like $1 bro he made so many people Filthy Rich wow so you still could buy in like you could buy you could buy you could buy a $100 worth you can buy $1,000 worth you have to buy one full Bitcoin you have you can buy $100 $10 worth of it oh okay and then it could still grow of course oh okay yeah of course it's grown almost 40% in last 3 months last 3 months 40% 40 50% so you put 1,000 it would have went to, 1400 right you put you put 100 140 right like whatever right so you don't have to buy a full unit of it oh okay yeah I'm going look into it yeah man yeah this is going to be epic to I should have bought in though that night but I just couldn't figure it out on my phone you know 10 years ago no one knew about dude it's even hard $78 Co this is about it about 10 years ago I I got I believe it was before Co I believe you bro it was before Co I believe CH is going to go up to more but hold it for one year Max uhhuh and when it go double take your money out wow so how how does that work they send you a credit card like you know to use to use in the ATM or what how's that work oh bro how breaking\n",

      "in though that night but I just couldn't figure it out on my phone you know 10 years ago no one knew about dude it's even hard $78 Co this is about it about 10 years ago I I got I believe it was before Co I believe you bro it was before Co I believe CH is going to go up to more but hold it for one year Max uhhuh and when it go double take your money out wow so how how does that work they send you a credit card like you know to use to use in the ATM or what how's that work oh bro how breaking down so you could purchase it right with your fiat currency which is called US dollars okay right so if you wanted 100 bucks you go to an exchange and then you you know digitally send over your $100 through efer whatever the [ __ ] it is bank wire I don't know um and then whatever methods they offer and then they'll give you the Bitcoin but then you could take that Bitcoin you could create something called um a wallet which is a digital wallet where you can send it into your own self custody so so you could you could like you need to own that [ __ ] in your own wallet you can link it to your you can link it to your bank account or what n bro not on an exchange that's better H you can't link it to your bank account at least ETF is not even Bitcoin it's a piece of paper melf self no he wants that Bitcoin he wants the actual asset in his own wallet in his own custody bro now if he's contributing short-term gains and EDF is a good way sorry I got some like expensive beef briskets stuck in my tee my bad unless yeah you and I are like you know we know how to store it and safe it the seat phas and everything yeah for him too much even ETF is good like just to multiply g g that's not even Bitcoin that's piece of paper I will never if I'm going to try to if I'm want to educate people to ask me how to buy Bitcoin I am not going to tell you to go buy ETF cuz that's not Bitcoin I'm sorry true true true that's yeah yeah you got to buy the right stuff man yeah you got to get the actual asset man it's like buy a gold or buy a paper gold like paper bu man it Ain you know it ain't the Bitcoin ain't the real deal the original you need the original listen Bitcoin was not created to be sold in [ __ ] Banks bro right it was the opposite so why would you tell somebody to go buy it from the bank Fu that [ __ ] you can spend that time to learn about it or not the bank don't want interest on it oh yeah Banks hate Bitcoin because they lose control over it right accelerator pre accelerator 20th [Music] [ __ ] so what is the basis of this meeting here which one this meeting this meeting essentially it's connecting the bring the project these are the BTC startup guys okay and uh they have raised funds previously for Val I'm pretty sure for Polar what in Portal as well yeah so no not portal no no no portal is not from them so they focus on stocks ecosystem but it looks like they might be bridging out of that or sorry branching out of that so um but mainly if you look at their project so B and Labs looks like one that's not part of ss they are going to be there for sure yes Bon Labs but this one could be I have this is going to be super [Music] interesting we got the BBC over [Music] here so Bitcoin startup lab albertt leang CEO he's known for helping projects reach their target such as vison Labs right that's an up incomer liquidum right that's more notably and also this one that I'm missing the the yes all right so he knows what he's doing we're going to this meeting I really don't know what to expect in terms of the basis of it um are there going to be projects that are pitching to us are there investment opportunities or is it just for educational purposes what you expecting from this trip well from what they've advertised is uh it's a private investors and Founders meeting officially so what I'm thinking projects might pit because they they the early you know startup the r fun for all the startups like you said and yeah Albert Lang he was part of the panel at the at the Bitcoin rense so while we think it's they are specifically working sax ecosystem I think they they might expect and their Horizons and focus on the other yeah he was there Trevor BDC I think he was there as well and they are both going to be showing up there so there'll be a lot more projects the new projects which we haven't heard of plus some of the existing ones it's very funny you know because about 10 months ago myself and MK reached out to him I we like what he was doing this was when ordinals just first came and about him was getting its attention we reached out to him we had about three calls he had to stop off the highway off the side of the road to take our call and he said the only reason why I took our call is because we said the right word I was like what what is that we said Bitcoin defi so that's the only reason why he responded back to our email so I don't know if he's going to remember me it was literally about almost a year ago I think he would because there were very few people talking about that thing you were one of the first Ms and especially for someone to stop the car he he would remember that conversation especially I mean a lot of things have changed since then and for you showing up here covering the event the way you have done and while we tring up with other projects yeah the folks behind Stacks they are on the Forefront of this whole Bitcoin Evolution right season one ordinals right nfts on um let's call it nfts on bitcoin they had their own version on saxs but this accelerator program that he's um founded they are on the Forefront of building on bitcoin yes right so here they go they're getting this love with Bitcoin L2 and for good reason so I'm very interesting and uh so let's see what happens let's see what happens oh [Music] man [Music] [Music] D the cats are taking over there from here my wife is going to like where you going you're leaving us all the time my babe I want to go make some money somehow though take a break I think the ma next major one is a big one from Asia Asia in Hong Kong Hong Kong so we're going to have a boost yeah we're going to have a Sol events and that's a few months from now right uh in May in May yeah I definitely want to go but during that period in April we're going to go to Abu Dhabi go to Dubai for the token 2049 which one token 2049 Dubai will be there in April that's a major so two major events token 2049 Bitcoin Asia and they lat on bitcoin Nashville nille that's a big one too yeah AIG one so they're moving from Miami and they're going to Nashville now right get back see the problem that way it's it is a big one but it's not targeted ler to right it's a bigco ecosystem but it's important because we need to make more Splash my impression and when it's for the laser eyes educate them because they like they don't want I don't want to read anything whatever talk about I don't give a [ __ ] bco need no adoption yeah it's opinion yeah but it's not a real consensus we need a system level consensus right the miners want it users want it infrastructure there everybody developers win it's the same arguments incription why would you incription people like it you know you you don't like it it doesn't mean the wasn't for BRC 20s we would be talking about L right now it's the truth it's the truth but people like to have fun with it right you know inscribe data on bitcoin L1 and all that right some people don't like it because they don't enjoy it they are lazy like care I don't care the red laser eye guys they don't like it they stub it yeah yeah yeah they they have their opinion years ago I know so always keep the same it's like our grandpas right like why we need the cryptocurrency yeah EX why we even need a mobile payments is that the grandpa mails his letters emails I just want to I just want to cash I don't even tust my credit card right that kind of it's true it's true it's true think explain it but the community has consensus the product Market fit is there so we need a defy on Pig Point go founder on vit guys so you want to talk a little bit about vit or sure if you want to yeah yeah yeah we are ear in the research phase as everybody else but I think we are the first team Deep dive on BBM since last year right we educate over 3,000 people already a lot of developers some of our article get over 100k views right nice so we start from Impact driven educated what's going on what's the what's the real missing Point what's the Gap right instead of just start at meting start nft start the price movement right which is very speculative right but um the focus more on the infrastructure itself infrastructure itself and then focus on what kind of def5 protocol can really build on it right so in talks lot of stick D5 protocols Perpetual Landing like Insurance option trading you know uh taxes all kind of things right the all kind of real financial markets yeah the def5 Primitive already worked in ethereum right they access to the Bitcoin liquidity they want access Bitcoin users you know we're hearing a lot of the ZK rollups you guys deal with ZK rollup or no so we are doing research I think ZK have a long way to go we are we are more going to the optimism kind of have more practic scheme like Aon optimism yeah that's good enough for def5 and I think making Z validity proof on bitcoin layer one currently is very very hard it's almost kind of emission impossible especially without a BP right and you we all know BP takes years toach it took tap rots UPG creation 3 years 3 years tap you think we have about 3 years to wait to actually see that so instead of waiting for 3 years we let's go for more practical route within next 12 months right cuz the market it's not going to wait for your 3 years yeah to wait for the VIP yeah yeah it's not it's too long it's true it's true it's true so why don't we just focus on real product Market fit focus on real prodct that could work right now with decoin right yeah yeah yeah cuz the liquidity\n",

RG our website everything everything's over there Wai need for a white paper which going to launch next month okay watch out for that cover you guys so they'll know about it that's the technical details to go to the exact approach we're going to take not just some car levels yeah and of course our Mainland we're launching maybe next next month or maybe early April okay so you can use it it's e compatible is it test that people can use right now or no yeah test already launched yeah can people expect any air drops I got to ask they love air drops man yes yes they can but uh details we haven't finalize it that's right yeah we finalize it yeah this is off the Record that's why off the Record stuff this is off the record you can also find him in Singapore right you're going to Singapore right the Bitcoin next Friday we're going to have a Bitcoin Singapore event Singapore go ahead yeah around a th000 people will be there a lot of weal will be there I heard a lot of lot of will be there in the audience yeah right yeah that's what the people we are talking to cool there you have it guys that's the co-founder of midir and uh he just dropped some knowledge on us and I'll be covering them too white paper everything and I can't wait for the main to go live I'll show that how that works as well I need no tou that stay tuned cool thank you so much bro thank [Music] you [Music] hello yes hi there um could you tell me what location you have a Bitcoin ATM machine that will allow me to sell Bitcoin for cash okay okay so if I want to withdraw I don't know 1,000 2,000 5,000 what is the limit required for me not to submit kyc cuz you know we bitcoiners are right we you know we like to preserve our privacy I'm not an on but you know okay interesting so $960 is the limit where I wouldn't have to submit ID anything above that requires ID so how does that process works so basically I'll go to the ATM machine I press some buttons I sell Bitcoin then what interesting so I get a text right to confirm that is my phone number and then that text will provide me with a password and then I put in that password on the ATM machine and then the process takes it from there I'll send over my Bitcoin to your address and then from there what happens wait wait wait hold on before i s my Bitcoin please just don't exit scam okay it's a terminology we we crypto guys use anyways okay makes sense I'll start that process and then once I send the BTC to your address you will ask for my phone number again then you'll send me back another passcode then that passcode will be entered into your machine and I should get my Mula Roger that thank you okay I'm on my [Music] way [Music] we're in Boulder Colorado just about 45 minutes outside of Denver Colorado where we're staying guys this is right next door to the university and inside the store there's a Bitcoin ATM machine as you guys know Bitcoin went up to about 63k we're going to take a little some something out I believe it's a $960 that would not require any kyc so let's see how that process [Music] works [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he [Music] [Applause] [Music] he [Music] take you [Music] link it's your boy Francis dun representing trends at Adventures at the L3 Summit here in Denver Colorado guys as you can see we got some really top ter projects here the likes of polyedra we also have Leno we got polygon we got starkware L zero what have you let's see if we can find one of these Founders and they can tell us a little bit more about their project what we could expect from this new technology that's for the most part going to be on layer three so let's go find that [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah no worries no worries at all so if you think about um back in like 2011 to 2013 time frame that was when we first started seeing a lot of the emergence of the first sort of Bitcoin Forks um and those Bitcoin Forks being like digibyte being um uh a Litecoin and a lot of others um they came out with uh essentially the same technology as Bitcoin all proof of work blockchains that had a slight technical Innovation that at the time was tremendous as a competitive Advantage right that being reducing the block generation speed or or increasing the block generation speed or reducing the um or increasing the size of the blocks um but when you fast forward to 2024 first of all none of those innovations that were so amazing at that point in time now really matter and ALS the also these Alternatives that were supposed to be better than Bitcoin and I'll compete Bitcoin they've kind of Fallen by the ways side um I think a lot of talent a lot of money a lot of time was poured into this um and as a result because these projects were all building all their Technologies in house by themselves they weren't able to Pivot to address new user needs and that pivot came in 2016 and don't quote me on this uh but 2016 with the emergence of ethereum and so with ethereum now you have teering completeness you have virtual machine environments and now all of a sudden the value proposition of blockchain evolves Beyond just on CH transacting and now is about decentralized applications and so as a result with Bitcoin and all the Bitcoin Forks everything else essentially kind of fell by the wayside Bitcoin continued to maintain that core community and then the ethereum race came and with ethereum you have all these Forks of ethereum emerging as well you see the same pattern of behavior and that pattern includes Forks of ethereum that are more flexible in terms of programming languages higher transaction throughput etc etc right these ethereum killers exactly EOS right Neo [ __ ] yeah right like so all these players come out they start building new technologies inous as Forks of ethereum in order to compete and beat ethereum but now you fast forward to 2024 and you see the same exact problems and those problems mean that you know all the other Technologies were built inhouse weren't able to scale weren't able to adapt to the everchanging user needs ethereum is still the dominant player and everyone else has fallen by the way side yeah now in 2024 you see the same exact problem layer twos are all creating these technologies that are you know in this current point in time seemingly differentiators but my argument is that if they truly are differentiators then why are applications deploying everywhere if the differentiator was truly a strong value proposition then they would only be deploying on one chain right and then furthermore the scalability issue isn't resolved by just one One Singular L2 and so as a result you see all these l2s creating different variations of technology that they deem Superior trying to out compete each other for bid on market share but at the end of the day what's that going to lead to in 5 years I think the same outcome same result exactly and so this is why I think modularity is extremely important and sorry for that history lesson no no that is wonderful I was want to say nobody ever explained it like that from a all way all the way down to Z it makes a lot more sense honestly that's a good way of saying it no worries so now we're at a state where modularity plays a critical role in what is modularity for someone who never heard that TR yes so modularity is the ability to take components that Exist Elsewhere and plug them into whatever you're building and so what that gives you is the ability to adapt very quickly and also to specialize in your core competency it's just like a very very rudimentary example of this would be you are a business you're the CEO of your business you're probably not doing all of your accounting on Excel spreadsheets or notebook paper right you're probably using QuickBooks you're probably using Gusto for payroll you're using all these software as a service why because they can do it better than you can at a fraction of the time and save you all that energy the same applies to how we can build blockchain infrastructure in 2024 modular Services services that specialize in different components and optimizing different components of scalability exist today that didn't exist before so the Bitcoin Forks the ethereum forks the ethereum killers they couldn't have taken advantage of this modularity right but we're in a day and age where there's Solutions like Celestia Solutions like igen layer Solutions like Avil near and you're able to actually take advantage of those core\n",

      "how we can build blockchain infrastructure in 2024 modular Services services that specialize in different components and optimizing different components of scalability exist today that didn't exist before so the Bitcoin Forks the ethereum forks the ethereum killers they couldn't have taken advantage of this modularity right but we're in a day and age where there's Solutions like Celestia Solutions like igen layer Solutions like Avil near and you're able to actually take advantage of those core Technologies plug them in and be able to adapt and deliver value to your users very quickly I think that this is only the beginning of modular components starting with data availability because the value proposition is so strong those blockchains you just Nam those are considered layer 3es no no no they're not considered using this technology exactly and so as a result right like whether it is technology now where whereby it's mostly da or in the future whatever it may be right as long as there's modular components that can continue to provide value to the users then if you're able to plug that into your infrastructure you can continue to adapt pivot and derive value and deliver value to your users think that's a huge paradigm shift because now all of a sudden these projects that traditionally have lasted only 3 months or sorry 3 years to 5 years before the next generation of innovation begins now can Outlast that right and continue to provide that level of innovation provide that level of value and I think with Manta that's exactly why we're taking that modular approach and more the bigger picture here even Beyond Mana is just hoping that other infrastructure services will start thinking about this in the same way because at the end of the day all these resources all this Talent all this time shouldn't be wasted right and so being able to adapt and continue to provide value and grow I think is the only way to do that and that is the so is Manta one of the Pioneers using this type of modularity I don't know I just told you everything about it but I'm just kidding uh yes I think so yeah I mean Manta we are the first and the largest modular L2 um you know using celes for data availability right like we we transitioned and plugged in Celestia to our infrastructure without having to hard fork with no downtime and as a result within 30 days of using Celestia we're able to save our users $1.8 million in gas fees so the value extremely tangible right and the modularity allows us to create this seamless transition and so we're able to Pivot our Layer Two and provide much value much more value at a faster Pace yes right when the time needed it and so I think that's extremely powerful and yeah really excited about that it is just one uh question off topic slightly here with the um emergence of Bitcoin lus what's your take on that um I know there's a divide here some are for it some are they say it's not possible sure I would love to hear your thoughts you seem very intelligent and knowledgeable in this field uh you know unfortunately I'm not an expert in Bitcoin layer 2os um so I don't really have too much of an opinion on it I am watching the space very carefully I think that the momentum is think it's interesting though is it something that I do think it's very interesting I think when I first heard about it I was a little bit skeptical because unlike ethereum which was built around decentralized applications and that sort of ethos right bitcoin's ethos is more so built around you know either store value or onchain transactions and I think the maximalists are a little bit more hardcore about that philosophy um and a lot of you know the the larger liquidity is also kind of locked up and I don't I don't know if people are willing to sacrifice Security in order take but I do see that as this fieldes to devel right see more and of these players actually being open-minded to it so you know I'm keeping an eye on it maybe somebody might make the first sort of modularity for Bitcoin but in a way people feel safe with their Bitcoin in these certain later tools we'll see very interesting stuff um you have any other questions or I know it all and yeah definitely the way You' explained it is said everything in great great we're forming a big line behind there so we'll let you go ahead thank you so much for your time we really appreciate that thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes what an events week it has been here in Denver Colorado from the Bitcoin Renaissance Summit all the way down to the L3 Summit I've learned so much for example like what Portal's building which is a rless bridgeless solution for Atomic swap technology it's going to pave the way for the future also we can't forget about Lorenzo which will be providing staking capabilities on bitcoin and at this L3 Summit I've learned about something called modularity blockchains which I didn't even know existed and what I've also learned is it's not all about dejing as much as we like that there are a young bright Minds who went to the likes of MIT and also former MDS who are building technology that will pave the way for the future of decentralized Finance now did I meet my goal in finding the next 100x I don't know but what I do know is the connections I made the people I met and what I've learned about this beautiful city and how they respect Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry will live with me forever Denver is a place that I will always remember and I would love to visit again but until then Denver you're on your own [Music] later [Music] you know rappers like to rock chain Rock block chains knock them out the box key ring full of water dat I got to pray that my Ace sick incinerators loow a mind like a creeper one time in my circus Divine to find way to keep the power build in check my equipment is starting to sweat crypto Anarchy becoming a [Music] threat\n",

gloves things like that and they become one of the like core providers right at the start of covet they shifted all their production manufacturing stuff they're like forget the vodka bottles forget the LED screens we need n95 masks and we need respirators and we need you know these testing kits and we need and they started producing this stuff and they started just winning all these contracts [Music] we're live Sean uh we have a bunch of stuff you you have a you have a a full menu over here and so do I yeah all right I want you to look at my menu here and I want you to just pick something off the menu go ahead and I'll Riff Off it we don't prefer people who they don't they don't know we only write like one or two words so you get like a teaser you're like man what the hell is this about but you don't know what it actually is but I have I put all my stuff in here an accident I have this new researcher who's crushing it he just gives me all the content like five minutes ahead of time but uh Rich neighbor how did I know you'd pick a rich neighbor so there's somebody in my neighborhood who I bumped into and I've just I'm you know I sort of get out there and I collect signals is this you know where where do I place this person on the uh the Billy scale like are they you know are they on their way up are they are they have they made it in life are they really balling out of control where where is this person these people have been balling out of control like when Christmas time came up there was just like the wife went outside and it was just pointing at windows and all of a sudden the house was lit up like a Christmas tree they had like so they had almost like decked out things and they go hey hey um invite your kids over uh this Thursday we have a snow machine they're we're building a Snow Hill in our driveway like uh you you want to do sledding without going to Tahoe what's that like a big snow cone is that what that no it's like a giant truck that comes that creates snow and it piles it up so that your like their house looked like it was in you know Michigan or something like that yeah but it's just like like it's like an ice machine or something yeah it's like yeah something like that yeah like a big snow cone like a big shaved ice thing yeah yeah you were right from the from the beginning you're right so they did this and they had a fake Santa there and I was like man this is a lot for a Thursday afternoon but okay uh this is cool like these people's style they seem really nice and I didn't know what they did so I kind of I hit it with the Google the other day and I was like let's see who these people are and they have a crazy story so they created a company that back in 2014 did this thing it basically it lets you take a vodka bottle they had a vodka bottle that had an LED sign going around it so you could give somebody a vodka bottle that would say happy birthday Sam or like you could program any message I could be like you know uh whatever I could be like you're getting an old [ __ ] whatever I could write any message on it it would go on your your vodka bottle all right seems kind of gimmicky I don't really you know not a bad idea but but balling out of control from that didn't didn't 100 make sense but that was it sounds like a Drop Shipping like joke sounds like my first idea out of college it's like this is like me in college would have been like bro next next Google I got it what if we took you know this Jager bomb and we put an LED screen on it wouldn't that be incredible and so so they had this thing and they were like licensing this out or something like that somehow like Shaq became an advisor to their company it was really crazy it makes sense yeah as you would five years later covet hits and you know what they decide to do they're like you know what [ __ ] this vodka thing let's go all in on creating like safety safety stuff for cover like masks respirators um gloves things like that and they become one of the like core providers right at the start of covert they shifted all their production manufacturing stuff they're like forget the vodka bottles forget the LED screens we need n95 masks and we need respirators and we need you know these testing kits and we need and they started producing this stuff and they started just winning all these contracts and so now like if you go look at their website it's one of those I know your Rich websites because there's like not a lot of information on it but if you go to like the P they have like a press release section and it's like PR Newswire company gets 113 million dollar contract with the government for safety equipment oh my God local East Bay success story where they uh they're now the the sole testing provider for you know with the Lakers Stadium Levi's Stadium like all these different places and so these guys are getting 100 million dollar plus contracts for their stuff now I think probably it's like you know probably only like 10 margin when you buy you think it's that selling masks I think for things like that probably it's like 10 15 is my guess maybe maybe during coven everyone was completely price insensitive and they could just charge whatever they wanted I'm not sure I would have thought that but um but wow dude what a what a pivot and uh you know that isn't that just kind of crazy and that was an opportunity kind of available to a lot of people right dude I know a bunch of people who did that and like I had a friend that did it and he's like dude check this out and he sends me a picture of a Shopify store and it's doing like 2 million a month I know a lot of people who did that and I've only followed up with one or two of them and uh I have a feeling that like of the eight people I know who did it like three of them it worked out and then the rest it was like a really quick cash grab but then they over bought inventory and it and it's like nothing do you know people who did that yes we there was a guy in um I had started this Mastermind group that's actually where I found Ben uh but like one of the other guys in The Mastermind group he like every time we came to the testimony does he live in Texas no he's in Canada every time he came to the Mastermind group I feel like he had a different business which is like not what you want in a mastermind group but he was a good dude and he would always be like oh I have this other business that's like oh you know for auto repair blah blah we do their SEO and I was like okay but then what about that thing you told me last time and then one time you came dude we're doing mobile covet testing trucks that will drive up to places and we can just do rapid testing for covet and we were like all right I mean that sounds cool but like are you like do you know anything about covet testing like does anybody in the world know about this like what he's like oh I got the scientist that's going to be great and then he came back and he was like hey um really excited to be here I need you guys help um like three months later he was like I really need you guys help about going public and I was like and he's like yeah we're gonna do like 85 million this year in revenue and I was like what and he's like yeah we're getting all these contracts with the state of uh with like the you know the [ __ ] in Canada like these country Country-Wide contracts and um you know yeah we think maybe we should take this public next year and I was like oh my God so how did it end I I don't even know because I that that guy my head was just spinning every time uh you know he would talk because I'm like this is either too good to be true or I'm too dumb and this is amazing and I can't tell which one it is it's probably some mix of both but you're right I know several people that went all in on covid right when it happened and like low-key got like an absurd amount of traction very very fast yeah like a ton my dad had actually called me one day and he goes my friend works at this hospital they need extra equipment they need extra masks I talked to somebody in India and they could produce these masks and like I think we could do like a two or three million dollar contract and I was like fantastic um should do it and he's like yeah I wanna but my dad has this problem where my dad is addicted to meetings like he thinks winning is like this important person met with me and then he'll tell me the duration of the meeting to show me the value he's like only scheduled for one hour but we sat there for 90 minutes and I'd be like okay so what like everybody so you know he was really interested two hours right and he was just like he just like always just obsessed with that so he was he just had a bunch of meetings and I was like Dad you're gonna it's all about that action boss you're gonna take some action here what what's gonna happen like go go for it do it and he's like well no I want he's like I want everybody to like sign off on it and de-risk it completely pay me up front and I was just like dude this is this is like the cheap way to do business like you got to take a little risk here you're throwing shade on your dad right now I hope he doesn't listen to this and you called him boss if I said Cosby boss he's getting in the headlock yeah my dad yeah we make fun of each other like we call it like it is I do a bunch of dumb things and I say when I do dumb things this is his dumb thing he is high planning low action on these things and he says it all the time like um we went I went I took him to Tony Robbins and Tony Robbins is all about like taking massive action on like the things you want and he's like I was like what's your big takeaway he's like oh man I need to take Massive Action and I was like that yeah that's that you did it you learned the right lesson from this thing he goes that's my problem I don't take Massive Action I was like whoa he started slipping back into like basically he's like I've identified my problem just like so right so true whatever it worked out for him yeah he did he did great like right for like Village in India to like live in like owning multiple homes dude the story great the story of you tell of your mom of like I think you said she like had never eaten with a fork or something and she just comes to America when she's 17. is that what you said I'm not exaggerating I thought you said I thought you said like she had they didn't use like utensils or she went to a restaurant and like or she actually you're right you're right that did happen no I'm not being disrespectful uh Mrs Perry that's this is the story it's on record and then also when she used a pay phone to call her brother to say that she was in town she didn't know like that you hang it up so she like let it hang yeah and then she she was just crying at the airport and some guy was like hey uh do you need help are you okay she's like I need like my brother's supposed to pick me up I don't know where he is like just landed in America and he said you have a phone number she's like yeah so he that guy picks up the paper film puts in the quarters calls the brother tells him hey she's at Terminal Two she's waiting here I'm gonna tell her not to move brother didn't even know oh your flight was today like you they had no correspondence like okay oh hang tight I'll be there and she talks to him and she's like he's like don't move and then that guy had left the helper had left and so she didn't she's like not only did I know how to use the Payphone I didn't even understand how do you put this back and she's like I kind of was like fiddling with it like kind of like like trying to get it to stick and I didn't know what to do I looked around nobody was there and I just left it hanging and I walked away she's like I'll never forget like just feeling so clueless about the world um and there's like five stories like that on her just yeah they got to America now they have a house in San Francisco so it worked out that's the uh that's the American dream um um all right another topic what do you got I got a quick one here so I saw this Tick Tock of this uh Professor uh some professor at College uh I apologize to her I don't know her name but um let me see if I can find it real quick she basically uh Professor Cooley I don't know what she's a professor Cooley at Emory University so shout out to her basically her she has she teaches marketing at um at this college and for her marketing class she goes all right glass um if you want to do well in this class you want to get an A you have one job go viral on tick tock all right I'll see you I'll see you in a few weeks like if you need help you know we have some maybe maybe some uh we can talk about what it takes to get there but like that's how you get a good grade go viral on Tick Tock awesome how old is she young looking or older younger looking um yeah she looks like you know she looks like if you were 12 she would be your friend's mom um got it all right so something like that whatever age that is perfect description so whatever so basically uh I thought this was amazing and it got me thinking like really how many more classes at a university should be taught this way um so for example like why isn't there a classic you know why isn't there a class at school where it's basically like okay we're gonna have four lemonade stands on campus break up into teams you're each gonna run a lemonade stand like and you know the top lemonade stand is going to get an A plus the next one gets a minus B plus B minus um and if you if you're not able to break this threshold of sales you fail and it's like just let them go and do their thing and let them learn 100 how it should be or it's like you know maybe it's the net profit so to learn about the cost management as well but like give them you know 500 bucks and be like go who can run the best lemonade stand or t-shirt company or whatever it is or writing on Twitter um like you know okay it's an English class should you basically go read Shakespeare and all the stuff or should I basically teach you how to do writing in like the modern day and basically the cold email newsletter cold email or Twitter and it's like yeah you need to grow an audience around whatever topic you're interested in it could be The Bachelor it could be World politics it doesn't matter you pick your topic but you got to write to an audience on that and you got to publish first thing is quantity you got to publish every day for the next 60 days um and then the next thing is going to be quality can you actually grow an audience can you get you know 50 open rate on a newsletter with you know a thousand people on it go figure out how to do that and so things like this I feel like would be so much better than the way that people learn about how to do real world business today in school another one would be flipping like uh everybody you're gonna look under your desk yep you're starting with this drill okay everybody's got a drill like your job is to flip this drill into the most valuable item you can get by the end of the semester go and it's like you got to sell this take the profit buy something else sell that and like just keep doing that until you can get to the biggest thing dude uh Ramon our friend Ramon his son goes to a school here in Texas and he his kid had a class where he had to go haggle and it was like you have to get this much of a discount from a retail store or something like that and I was like Ah that's awesome that was awesome it's like great for a 12 year old so I love that stuff I dude I didn't have CL when I was all right my sophomore year of college I was a division one athlete a runner nonetheless a runner a Peak physical condition they'd made me take a aerobic walking class which was like if you add up the tuition it was like nine grand or something like that so I'm on it was aerobic walking you show up and you go for a walk so I'm all in favor of this stuff I think it's awesome like are you walking at least at like a fast pace why is it called aerobic walking versus just walking is that just branding is this the gym teacher how to justify their their their pension or their uh salary I don't know it was the stupidest thing ever like it was it was crazy it was crazy to me I had to take aerobic I remember this it was ridiculous uh you just like showed up what do you mean you had to seems like they don't force you have to get like these certain amount of credits and it was like this aerobic walking classes was your major like PE why why was this because they make I don't know I don't remember exactly why I had to do this no I don't even remember what I majored in I think just like accounting or business or something it wasn't so I left school early so it was accounting and then I and then I left school and then I finished online later and I was like okay you know give me just give me any diploma that I can get please because um I moved out so I the summer I had to take like some summer classes and one extra semester and uh I heard about Airbnb and I was like that's where it's at so I wanted out there yeah yeah so you you know I think I told you this I had heard about how you applied I didn't know you were in college and dropped out for it I didn't drop out I well I I don't know if it's technically drop out I just like quit going and then I finished online like I couldn't move it to an online student yeah like I took like some time off and then I eventually like finished and I would have to go like to a Kaplan you know like those Kaplan like testing centers and I would have to take these nonsense nonsense tests but basically there's this famous runner I was runner at the time and there was a famous runner named Chris lukasik and he quit running which wasn't exactly lucrative but he was like the seventh most fast fastest Miler ever and he was like I quit I'm quitting running at my Peak to join this thing called air bed and breakfast and I was like what the hell is that that sounds awesome and so I uh emailed Joe gebia the founder of Airbnb and I was like hey uh I I like Airbnb I came up with this interesting hack that I think could help you grow uh here it is and he forwarded it to it was at the time there was this thing called rapportive that had just come out and I built an Excel sheet where you could type in someone's first name last name and like their Gmail or their company name and then it like permutates and you put into this thing and it tells you which email is there so not like that sophistic of a hack at all but it was like new technology and I emailed them and in his head he's probably like this is dumb but like the fact that you came up with this like whatever we'll interview you so the interview and so he puts me to a minion the minion was like hey do you want to come to the Bay Area well I don't know who the guy was but the guy is probably worth a really underused word I'm gonna start using that that's an amazing slander I love it well that minion is probably worth 20 million dollars I mean you know because at the time they were only like 200 people and the guy who he referred me to was like the 17th employee and so his name was Justin I'm still friends with him sorry Justin call you minion but maybe you were like that's your friend I'm friendly with them but he uh they uh they go all right great do you live in the Bay Area and I was in Tennessee at the time I didn't know what the hell the Bay Area was when he said I had never been west of Missouri I'd only basically been to like Missouri and then like whatever the states are when you drive to like Destin Florida for like spring break those are like the only places that I'd been and he goes are you in the Bay Area and I was like of course yeah it goes great come into my office on Monday so it's like [ __ ] I gotta get out there I gotta figure out what the hell the Bay Area is I thought it was La so I pack up like yeah like Silicon Valley I heard someone make a joke about Silicone Valley but that was like where like porn is I think in L.A I I they're all the same to me I didn't know and so I Googled what the hell the Bay Area is and I bought a ticket and I flew out there and I interviewed with him on a Monday and a Tuesday and then I interviewed with Joe the founder he probably didn't even remember me because it was like a 10 minute interview and then I go home on a Wednesday they offered me the job on a Thursday and then a week later I I called my mom I go dude I got this job this is awesome and they go what the hell is this you stay at someone's home I go yeah I think it's gonna be legit she goes it sounds like a multi-level marketing scheme and I'm like well they have like health insurance and she goes whatever and so my mom drove down and packed up my apartment with me and then shipped me off and like she like gave me a thousand dollars and that was my seed money so I moved out there and this was all in like a three-week span the Sunday night before I'm supposed to start they call me and they go we busted you man you lied about your resume because you have a criminal record at the time I'd gotten arrested uh for DUI and I was like well technically like I'm still like the trial's still happening so like I didn't get convicted yet and they're like yeah but that was it isn't until proven guilty yeah they're like but that was sneaky like we asked you if you've been charged or whatever and I was like you're right I'm sorry so I didn't actually get the job I was hired for like a second but I never had my first day and then fast over two years later my wife ends up going to work there and I remember walking around I'm like uh my alma mater my old Stompy grounds so I never ended up working there but I had a job there for like you know a few minutes and uh you know it could have been something great I would think I would have been like employee 200 I don't know maybe I would have made some money or not but that's the story of Airbnb that's an amazing story I love that and while out there I also had to like take these classes and I remember I didn't have any money I had the thousand dollars that was my my money and I used to have to take this bike and I lived in the dog patch in a warehouse that was 900 a month and I asked her right I live in San Francisco they're like he lived in a dog patch warehouse It's called Dog Patch it's like uh real part of San Francisco by the water and I used to have to ride my bike because I didn't have any money and I had to ride a bike that I took for my roommate all the way up to Twin Peaks to go to the Kaplan like place which is like six miles away literally up the steepest Hills in San Francisco and so I used to have to do those classes and take tests for like months it was horrible but it worked out and now you're here incredible and now dude I used to uh like I like I I learned how to like get get rid of like you could jump on the bus and like when they they would catch you all the time and they'd be like where do you live and I'd be like I don't know uh what's your name and I just like give a name and they're like do you have any ID on you I'm like no I don't have ID and so I remember like there was Zero countries there's zero consequences there are zero consequences I mean That's how little I had like I didn't have cash for a bus fare which is 250 but uh uh yeah it turned out okay what did you do to uh to grow that thousand how did you not just wipe out like because thousand dollars doesn't get you very far in San Francisco so how did you not wipe out in three months on my so when I went to the interview for Airbnb I stayed at the cheapest Airbnb there was which was a bedroom in this guy's house and he had told me he was starting a business and so when I moved back out there I go hey dude uh I don't have a job anymore can I join you I only have like two or three weeks of like payment and then and uh my mother and father had given me a pickup truck for college and I asked them to sell that and they sold it so they gave me four thousand so I was like all right I got like three weeks of rent or three weeks of like living expenses now I just got this influx of four or five grand um I've got like six months of cash let's do this and and so I started I co-founded a a company with this guy a roommate matching company where we would uh post ads on Craigslist saying we were hosting these roommate parties where we would match people up into three and four bedroom apartments because normally it's like uh you're a single person who just moved there don't know anyone so you got to move into a existing bedroom and there's lots of competition so we would post fake existing bedrooms and get 300 people to apply on Craigslist and be like hey this doesn't exist but we'll team you up with 200 other people who Wanna the same [ __ ] as you and we would host these parties and we would charge people money to attend those parties and after they got an apartment and so we basically spun that up on Weebly and made money right away and that's how I lived amazing uh wow great stories I love this uh I feel like yeah I feel like there's a bunch of I've heard bits of these but not all of them uh this is great and I would ride my bike to like collect these money I would knock on their door after they got the apartment I'm like hey you got my money it was ridiculous uh that's so good uh after this I have to go get a hearing aid and uh I'm gonna get fitted for one and I have to tell you why I forgot to tell you this we are at the Vancouver thing and there is these two women speaking to me afterwards foreign and it was loud so like the problem with my hearing is I can't hear the difference between background noise and the person speaking for me it's hard to tell the difference and these women were talking to me and you probably noticed this I lean in hard so I'm only deaf in one ear but I lean in I lean I turn and I and I I get really close to you and also it was just super loud After Party by the way it was like it was like a club it was like a club it was loud and I also stare at people's lips so I I'll either stare at your mouth or I'll lean in Mr really signals over here the horrible worst signals at this moment comes up to me and I'm leading in and like I'm starting to get really close and I can tell she's really uncomfortable and I I go oh I I'm sorry I forgot to tell you I I'm deaf I can't freaking hear you that's why I'm leaning in so hard and uh it was at that point I was I told Sarah I was like I gotta go I gotta get a hearing aid I can't I'm making people uncomfortable this is why you bring your wife with you to all events just to like you know totally totally make it clear what's happening here dude and I a rule I don't I don't travel alone I love having her around when I travel but that is that's definitely the icing on the cake is having around for that reason yeah yeah you you did the opposite of the billionaire hug you like you went in with the with the Brooke boy lean yeah the broke point lead I'm just staring at her lips and she says I literally tried to watch as the words come out of her mouth and just staring go down her lips and looking and then leaning in and oh man I can tell she was uncomfortable I was like oh I forgot to tell you I can't hear so I'm gonna go get one of those things did you ever learn that like trick from this might be it might have been in like those pickup artist things I'm not 100 sure but you're looking at their the triangle yeah yeah yeah like the third eye or something like that no no it's if you ever wanted if you want somebody to want to kiss you you're close if you let's say you're close you're in range and you want to like kind of almost like hack their little like biology and get them to want to kiss you you you do this like triangle so you basically look at one eye the second I down to the lips back to the first eye so he makes it it traces like a little triangle and if you do that you'll just see immediately the person just pucker up maybe yeah right it just happens um yeah right I don't know if it's because you're signaling that you want to kiss them or that it just makes them want to kiss you but this [ __ ] works this was like in college I was like you know you would have thought I'm in the Illuminati how many triangles I was throwing up everywhere because I was like this is like a magic trick this thing is amazing did you get any girls in college probably you're really charismatic King baby you had a good batting average but not a home run got that lead off never got a second yeah oh well that's good the hard part two is my roommate was like um just unbelievably good with girls and so he's really good looking good looking guy and he was right here right yeah Trevor he's an athlete and he's just like a professional flirt and so somehow this guy was just pulling crazy people like you know you have like an RA who's like the the person who's like four years older that lives in the Freshman dorm he just started dating the Ra's girlfriend and then like you know he started dating this girl on the basketball team and started dating like all these seniors started dating this like one really rich girl who's giving him gifts all the time I was like I don't know what's happening here but like um you know this guy's definitely sucking up all the the alpha male energy in this room and uh you know I'm just sort of here along for the ride but it's okay it turned out all right uh well you know you worked out all right by the way my dating life was a lot like my startup life it was basically like fail fail fail fail fail home run it's like you know like most people in their career they sort of get this like 10 raise a year or whatever where it's like this linear like steady climb up the ladder but if you're in the startup world you're often like making nothing or in debt or bro and all of a sudden for like seven eight years and then all of a sudden you're rich and uh that's what my dating life was like I was broke for like 10 years and then all of a sudden I was rich 100 same it like it didn't it didn't start picking up until my 20s it was exactly you're trying to get what were you trying to do in your teens bro I tried I tried a lot trust me I tried I just I looked like Napoleon Dynamite I I with braces it just didn't work out dude I didn't talk to a girl I was sitting there reciting lines from The Rock in WWE when I was in my teens bro I was I was jumping off the top rope in my bedroom trying to you know just I love wrestling and basketball and stuff I didn't have time for girls when I was like 15. it was a numbers game for me I knew like you know three percent conversion therefore you know you got to try a hundred times right yeah you never want more of attrition to describe it whatever I it worked out we both it worked out for both of us before we get into this we got to remind people there is a gentleman's agreement except this time it's different so we have this thing at this podcast unlike everything on YouTube and on Spotify and all that stuff our content actually isn't free you're only getting this episode for free if it's your first one and if it's your second or third one you have to go do something first what is it they gotta fire up YouTube youtube.com YouTube the app whatever

and we need we need this this is what we need right everybody's got needs food shelter YouTube subscribers these are your core core Primal needs and we have ours and uh that's why it's called the gentleman's agreement we're not on the other side so you just have to do it and everyone's doing it lately so you should do it and that's what we expect out of view and also do me a huge favor and actually click follow on the podcast app and Spotify because those help us actually go up the rankings and then we go up the rankings we get more dopamine and we do Dumber [ __ ] and that's why we're here so do that um I have a story for you so go to joop.com so it's j u p e Jupe so it's jupe.com okay they have a slick looking website so tell me what you see I see some sort of like Mega tent Contraption I don't know what this is this is like some sort of structure it's like is this like a like basically like an outdoor unit that's uh not like something more than a tent but less than a house so I met these kinda I met these guys recently and they're really fascinating and so basically the one of the founders he's like this artist type he's his name's Jeff Wilson and before this he like wrote a book because he lived in a dumpster for a year like he like slept in a dumpster it was like some like art project as well as like to show like for what I don't I don't know I mean he's a wacky interesting guy but he lived in a dumpster and then he uh then he started this like prefab house I guess it was like marketing for like a pre pre-fabricated homes or something like that and um they eventually launched this startup it's called Jupe and I originally saw it because Gary tan famous investor billionaire investor Gary tan made this YouTube video where he stayed in one of their things and so basically what it is is it's I don't know they would be mad if I called it a tent but it kind of looks like a tent but basically they ship it to you on in like a a huge container and you pop it up and on the inside it's like a fancy or like a nice mattress and then there's like a heating and cooling unit and it's got lighting that's all solar powered and so it's like a standalone like house and the way that their business model works is you can do one of two things you could just buy it for 30 grand outright or you can do a thing where you they give it to you for free and they take something like 40 30 to 50 of the revenue and you rent it out and these things are renting out and I was like I don't know man who wants to stay in this thing and he was like dude we rent them out for 250 to 500 a night and they're always booked and they're trying to pitch it to me to put it on my land and I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it or not but they're it's a pretty interesting thing this year they're supposed to do like 12 million in revenue and it's break even and they've deployed 400 of these things and their future what they're doing is they've got these guys that are just buying plots of land and then putting 15 or 20 of these on there and then dupe the company if you do the profit sharing with them they kind of run it for you so they have like their own little platform and they like will help manage the thing for you but it's pretty fascinating and I've been thinking about putting one of these uh on my on my property I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it or not because I don't know if I want more work but really fascinating interesting idea that I came across I've been loving these ideas where you just make more money off the [ __ ] that you already have so like I have land and I was like should I just like put these all over my place but they look kind of fascinating and I thought you'd get a kick out of it yeah I mean these look super cool and I got a couple credit because I see a lot of these like um like this kind of like I forgot what's called adus or whatever it's like this additional dwelling unit or something um and they're often just like vaporware it's just a render of something that looks sick and what I really like is if you click their Vision tab it opens up a notion it explains what they're doing and four times in this thing it just says here's our thing parentheses not a render here's what it looks like you know after it gets delivered here's what it looks like the next day again not a render like hey we actually build the thing it exists this is real this is not like some futuristic dream um and so I think that's pretty pretty pretty amazing this looks super cool I don't know why you wouldn't do this just for even like the story so uh I can I have an update so my I have this property uh marathonranch.com and you can see it it's doing like uh anywhere from 13 to 17 000 a month in gross revenue and um so it's doing well I'm like making money on my Airbnb finally I got like 40 or something like five star reviews on Airbnb and I finally started going up the rankings and it's been really fun to do and so I'm not sure but I have 20 acres 20 acres of land I'm not sure if I want to like screw anything up because dude at my Airbnb I we have like 20 cows so my neighbor his account well that's true but like people my neighbor owns these cows and they use our property and in exchange we pay less property tax and people like wake up to like a moving cow because they sleep and wake they sleep at all my property for some reason they decided that's the bed and I don't know if I want to like screw that up it's like so peaceful going out there so I don't know if I want to screw that up by having more units on the property but uh dude Marathon ranch.com your photo here you chose the wrong photo you chose like a not awesome looking photo for your hero photo then if you click Gallery you all of a sudden see all these awesome photos it's a work in progress my friend it's a work in progress Ive it's still in beta yeah it's because one of the pictures it you couldn't see the writing anyway it's a whole thing I gotta fix but uh anyway it's going well I I always I basically to listeners I send Sean updates on my Airbnb and he's like oh that's neat you're making five percent you're making five percent return that's that's really that's lovely what did I tell you you were like dude this is if this is five percent or seven percent or seven percent of years it's great I go and I told you I go I've lost more money in crypto than you'll ever make on your Airbnb yeah somehow that felt like a good statement to me that's a man the Airbnb game it's been fun it sucked for a minute and then once I started rolling it is pretty dope so maybe one day you'll you'll be convinced but right now it's killing it I don't know if they'll kill it in like June when it's like 100 degrees but we'll see to me the only reason I would do this is the tax benefits if I bought property um the actual like rental income and or and or slow real estate appreciation to me is not worth it especially given the headache of doing stuff so you said let's say from a financial investment it's only been okay but from a like reward like it's been quite exciting what is the margin so you say 13k a month um gross okay so now we take out what Airbnb we take out Property Management we take out utilities we take out what what how much what's the gross on that so like a like a record month recently was like 17 000 but let's round down to 15 000 because that's what it's been lately so that's gross so I give away so I own the property outright but I assume that I have a mortgage so if you assume that I had a mortgage plus utilities and taxes that's in the 7 000 range okay um I don't have that but let's just assume that I do because I will get one eventually um and then property management is 20 of uh of uh like the 14 000. so if I do 50 if I do 16 000 Revenue three hundred dollars per stay goes to my cleaner so whatever that let's just say that's two thousand so that brings us down to whatever that is what I say 15 minus two thousand that's thirteen thousand and then management gets 20 of that and then the rest I assume it goes to a a property um property taxes and a fake mortgage so all said and done on fifteen thousand in Revenue I'll walk away with only three thousand maybe yeah that's nuts so that means let's see uh we did we have 15 000 so 20 margins yeah it's it's not like it's not kids on the 15. well but I have depreciation so I'm able to like save a fair bit there but um yeah like it's a cash on cash return it's gonna end up being like five or somewhere between five and eight percent but if you assume appreciation which is a big assumption but I looked at the trailing 30 Years it'll probably be a 15 to 20 percent uh annual return if I own it for like 10 years right so but that's a big if so that cash on cash it's only okay it's only okay but I'm completely hands off and I also like it and I've I learned how to do something so I didn't I didn't do everything I didn't do everything right here at all I I think I paid a premium I definitely paid a premium for the property dude I know you paid a premium because if I look at this uh like if I go to the gallery it's got the kitchen with like the white everything's like white and like this one look of wood that I'm just like a sucker for if it looks like this I'm like it's a nice place people yeah we know about construction they're like this is like cheap and easy like you know I would walk into a house and like well this is a good house so I'm gonna pay a premium for this house if they're like why because the countertops are nice and I'm like yeah I mean look at this it looks fantastic looks modern and they're like dude that's that costs nothing like you need to pay for a location you need to pay for square footage you need to pay for all these other things but I'm a sucker for like just like the countertops but I have 20 acres and so my my plan my plan originally before the Market's tanked I was like I'll put more I'll build more crap there and then when the Market's tanked I got cold feet and I was like well let's just sit on it and just see what happens and so now I'm just sitting on it and it's going awesome like it's it's it's booked constantly and so I'm happy with it I don't regret it I would I would do it again um and I but like I learned it was a lot of money to like you know it was seven figures to like get in the game and so I was [ __ ] nervous as hell right it's worked out and I've learned how to do it so now I know more about it so I'm happy happy I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better all right let me go um I got two blue collar hustles for you so these are in the trash in the trash Biz so um I've heard of two trash misses recently that I thought were pretty interesting I wanted to share them with you I want you to tell me which one you like better okay so the first one our buddy Sie Ava told me about this it's called smash my trash have you ever heard of this has he told you about this no but you want to know something funny I've been very close with cieva for like 12 years now and I don't I still don't know how to say his last name [Laughter] yeah I I just he's in my phone book as the very first time I ever met him I just he said he was Russian so he's just saved as cieva Russia and so I just assumed he was Cave of Russia I mean this guy was like in my wedding clothes save a tall handsome smart yeah I just called him Adonis yeah first name and then attributes like visual attributes I remember you buy Six Pack six three got it I have a system and it serves me well um all right so Stephen was telling me about this franchise called smash my trash and so what they do is they basically imagine a giant like Crane and so they drive to any business and like if you've ever been to like we had a warehouse so our warehouse just produces like an um like an ungodly amount of trash just cardboard you don't just burn it just be normal so we have Charlie Charlie burns the trash but like I forgot at that um you would have basically a dumpster and you get charged per like I don't know like per filling of the dumpster like how many times you fill the dumpster and then you call them up and they come and they empty your dumpster what smash my trash does is they'll you sign up for them they drive around they'll come to your dumpster and they just take this giant crane arm and just smash the trash in just compacting it um they let you get way more volume or less it takes less fill so it lowers your trash bill and um you know that could save you hundreds of dollars every month if you do this and so basically the cost of smash my trash should just be less than the savings that they give you from having to do less uh less dumpster fills and so this is like a franchise that kind of crushes it basically you can run this with like two guys and the numbers on this are you invest like I don't know 400k typically they'll make like a million dollars a year in revenue and like 300K of like net income like even a at the end of the day and so you're getting like a kind of amazing cash on cash not not that not that trash returned you were getting on your Airbnb this is some real real returns and um and I think they have I think they have like a [ __ ] ton of locations I think they have like 160 locations or something like that um and so that's like they've made probably 40 50 million dollars in just a franchise fees just uh franchising this concept out so I think this is kind of a like low-key amazing business it's amazing but there's a big downside when was the last time you had a blue collar job do you remember have you ever had one restaurant yeah when I was restaurant not 21 yeah what happens at a restaurant when it closes do you remember just Carnage Carnage everyone goes and gets super screwed up they get drunk you take pills you get hot you just do all types of [ __ ] and then hopefully they show up the next day and there's lots of like I remember I've you know I've I've been a janitor before I've worked in restaurants I've done all this stuff and there was like particularly in restaurants there was constant like issues with this type of person who works there and it sounds classless but it is kind of The Facts of my experience I don't know what do you think the trash I guess if a trash person has a job maybe they get up early so and I when I think of a trash guy I think more of a Family Guy yeah for some reason I trust a trash guy like you know I feel like a trash guy is reliable dependable salt of the earth you know like I feel like it's not the degenerates that you'll get like I would rather hire any Trash guy than a barista at Starbucks right like I feel like the Barista is a flake and we never know what's gonna happen but well the worst is is is like a bartender yeah or a waiter at a fancy like nighttime restaurant like a like a like a or like a like a TGI Fridays like you know what I'm saying like the worst of the worst there's someone out there right now listening to this that is a waiter at TG Fridays it just slam their phone in disgust dude I've worked at all these places I've worked at all these places and like this is probably why I had a little bit of a habit it's I don't know man this is the downside of if you have unlimited access to loaded nachos then something just happens to you yeah yeah like the blooming onion it's like uh it's like it's like the full moon you know what I'm saying like I turned into a werewolf if I get that every night you know like it's it's bad I try to do like a like a Guns and Roses after party like I'm going wild I'm throwing furniture out the window so uh yeah is this cool yes I think there's a lot of headache and I would be curious we have a good friend uh or I'm I think you're friends with them his name's Brian Brian uh scudimore or scuttlemore he owns um sounds like a good friend got junk and Brian has been on the Pod and uh he uh I don't know if maybe I could say this but the company's 100 bootstrapped Revenue this is public Revenue I think is in the 300 to 50 350 million dollar a year range he owns 100 of it he parlayed that now they own like a painting business and they do all these like Services I would be curious what he would have to say is like his trash guys like or his franchisees are like degenerates or not and like what's the headache with those type of people we should definitely ask him I feel like uh I feel like he's gonna give his sign off on this so so this is one trash idea the other one comes from Twitter I gotta give credit to Mobile Home Park guy um I I know the guy behind us he's actually pretty awesome but I don't know if he's trying to be public with his identity here but he's part of our our guy Mafia right we got the the restaurant front guy we got the car dealership guy now we have a mobile home park guy and he goes I just found this trash business that is called bin scrub and what they do is they clean off your trash cans so they wash the power wash your trash cans because everybody's trash cans are filthy he's like he's like here's how I would take this business and turn it into you know six figures a year of profit he goes why do I love this business so everybody's got trash bins so you know your Market is every home um it's a very young industry low Market penetration so you'll probably be the only person offering this service is not like a bunch of competitors yet um you just need one truck and some hustle uh in a post-covered world there's lots of germaphobes and you can play on that and this has like word of mouth virality so you know this has like public virality you can see the actual service being done and so he goes so he goes you've got to buy a truck the trucks are about 40K but it's a hard asset you're going to be able to get a loan against this so you might only have to put down five or ten thousand dollars and get a bank to finance the rest because the truck will do this um he goes now here's how I how is here's how I juice this business to make it more more valuable hey guys we're gonna make it make this like the ice cream truck we're gonna put a speaker system on top and every time we're coming around your neighborhood we're playing the same song He's like you know I'm going with Outcast So Fresh So Clean just like just because it's a pun and he's like we're gonna play this every single time this song is our branding we're gonna drive around from 3 P.M to 8 PM when people are home from school home from work and they can look out the window and be like what is that and then they will they will see us power washing someone in their neighborhood's bins you can even it's like a horrible idea hold on hold on hold on he goes um he goes we're gonna we're gonna like basically leave little flyer brochures on top of everyone's bin so when they take out the trash they're gonna see that you know this trash can is dirty we clean them out we we leave your trash can so clean you could eat cereal from it and he's like that would be my he's like my I put a spoon in it be like you're so clean you could eat cereal out of this um so he's like that's what I would do for my marketing he goes I think one truck can do about 100 to 200 homes a day it's a few thousand dollars a day per truck in Revenue um you'll use that to finance the second truck your costs are gas water maintenance some chemicals assuming you're the one doing the truck and he's basically like this is a blue collar side hustle if somebody wants to themselves get out there and get to that 10K a month of of income uh that they may not be able to get out of their job this is this is his idea so he goes what do you think fella so Sam you said it's a horrible idea tell me why uh okay so completely uneducated here so two doubts uh I don't think that you can do I I don't think that that many people would want this and number two 100 to 200 a day that's so many that is so many I would how much it would take 20 minutes to drive somewhere I don't that math is wild to me yeah you'd basically have to get to a like dense area and then and then do a route but that would kind of assume that they're all your customers which they're not gonna all because your customers at the start did he call us out and say what do we think no but oh you know he listens to the Pod so uh by the way there's two people there's two people in the comments here one um sparkling bins business they make the trucks so there's a woman in the comments goes it's a fantastic business we've been we manufactured the trucks it's been going great since 2020 and then another guy goes um yeah I do this mine's called bin Busters I'm two years in it's going great okay well I mean what the hell do I know and by the way that guy his bio says living the American dream uh good good for him he's this is their dream and they're they're pulling it off uh uh I don't know man I'm out I'm out in this one I don't want to do this it was like start a newsletter yeah start a newsletter dude I uh I I I've people make fun of me because I bring this up so much I had hot dog stands whatever but I used to work with my hands outside it's so hard man it is so you said you were a janitor when were you a janitor uh when I was in eighth grade I worked at a bakery and it was my job to like mop the floors take out the trash clean the dishes and so that was like my first job six dollars an hour and then uh yeah that's what I did dude I am so mad at my parents for never giving me my my my grind story like can I you didn't do anything hardship yeah like yeah you ain't gangster at all I mean an Uncle's store for a month and just just give me that story five dollars an hour and I had to empty the trash like nobody knows how long I did it like I got nothing dude I grew a lot of Asia parents don't want you to do that they say do your home hands got no calluses yeah and my kids I'm gonna give them one hustle story you know they're gonna have some very token small hardship that will sound good later when they make it because you need that story and I I just don't have it a lot of my Indian friends which I have a ton they their parents were like you don't even clean your room just do your homework just study is that what they said to you like like don't cook don't clean just study well they didn't say it like that but I wasn't asking to cook or clean so it just never came up and they were like yeah your your job is to study and do good in school so you can get like a good job don't go be a janitor and I was like dude I did it all man I did the janitor stuff I was a waiter I was a busboy I was a valet driver I did it all man and uh I'm happy I did it but uh I don't want to do it anymore oh and by the way I need to redeem myself I made fun of like the someone the other day said the retail class so this is like the the blue collar class but uh I read this there was this funny article on Business Insider it had the worst but hilarious title and it was I'm a millennial manager who works with Gen Z and then said like Colin with Gen Z workers they have a lot of feelings and so look you're either gonna like somebody you're gonna have drug issues work with one group of people or you're just gonna have to talk forever about like bringing your whole self to work and all that nonsense so like we all have our faults we're all screwed you know what I'm saying I hate when people say bring your whole self to work I'm okay with you just bringing your work self to work that's cool too you don't have to prefer that yeah I prefer that if you want to bring a little bit more of yourself we could talk about that too but like you know it's not a mandatory you don't have to bring your whole self right I'm okay with just your work self so we all every every every class and every generation has issues so I don't mean to throw shade just at one um we throw shade at all here we're at equal opportunity shade thrower yeah Dad Sam is the trash man I'll make fun of myself someone made fun of me the other day because I've got these surgeries on my ear I was talking about my ear and my glasses sit funny I don't know if you notice my glasses sit crooked because like it's my ear and someone said uh it looks like Sam got brain Sam got head surgery didn't pay for him to put the rest of it back in because of his glasses are sick and I was like no that's kind of kind of accurate yeah yeah you're kind of there um dude I told you the other day I want to tell you about a media company that most people have no idea about but they kind of killed it and I love it so I told you the other day about about parcast I tell you about parcast yeah yeah this was the uh podcast Network that was doing True Crime stuff yeah so I learned about the story I think the guy who started just tweeted saying that he was done at Spotify so I guess his or not is up but listen to this so it was a three-year-old uh startup that sold for 50 million dollars to uh Spotify and the way it started was the guy his name was Max Cutler at the time his 27 year old graduate and he bootstrapped this thing his dad worked in radio I don't think his dad was like a rich guy I think his dad uh Ron Cutler I think he was like a uh he was a radio broadcaster so he had industry but I don't think he was like in the business type of thing and he uh they bootstrapped this thing and by 2018 it's only two years in they had 16 shows with a hundred million downloads by 2019 they had 40 weekly shows now they have a staff of something like 150 of which 75 of them are voice actors and I listen to these it's so weird I listen to these every night when I go to bed so like I've got like my favorites I listened to one called serial killers there's another one called deathbed confessions and there's another one called like murder couples which is about Bonnie and Clyde there's another one like it's like all these things and there's and it's not like our podcast at all there's zero riffing and it's like voice actors see we should just make up fake True Crime shows like stabbed but not dead yet the black guy yeah I just just like stories that people just got mind of her was it really an accident yeah spit on by a homeless guy stories of NYC exactly not injured but it was gross yeah barely assault uh you hurt my feelings True Crime Thrills dude and but like this is the reason why I like this is it's not like uh it's like they're just like you know how weird talking about like people who do things beautifully done like you know uh This American Life and it's like thoughtful it's like thoughtful like today on This American Life we're gonna talk about like the opioid crisis and they like go out and interview people this is not that it's just someone who read a book summarized it and then is reading it and they pump out like literally one a day and they have like uh you know 40 shows in that 40 shows now and it's just a volume play and this guy was like dude this true crime [ __ ] to Their audience is 75 women and then me uh and they're they're like Their audience like it's crack it's crack to me I cannot stop listening to this [ __ ] and it's the same thing every single day you know it's kind of like Family Guy you know Family Guy they've been doing it for like 25 years now it's the same [ __ ] all the time it works every time I'm gonna watch it every single time it's just like that it's the same shtick over and over and over again and they were acquired it was they required for something like 53 million or 54 million dollars in cash and then like another 50 million in earn out but pretty fascinating this guy bootstrapped this and they're not popular on social 20 000 followers Twitter 36 on Facebook 50 000 on Instagram they just dominated like people searching for their their one podcast is called serial killers that's all it's called and they just like dominate when people search these so it's like long tail it's like what's the difference what's SEO for podcasts peo I don't know uh and they just crushed it really fascinating business and I brought that up so I did it I hadn't done the proper research I needed to kind of close that Loop you know there's a we had talked about the beautifully done like you know just X but beautifully done there's another version of that that we haven't talked about and uh I don't know I don't know about you but like when I was growing up like if I had like a plate of food and it's like let's say it's I had a bunch of veggies I had a broccoli a brussels sprouts stuff like that I didn't really want it I was kind of like tired of eating it but it's still there and I know I should eat it um me and my sister used to have this thing where if one of us was like in that that spot where we wanted it we know we should do this but oh God just the idea of sitting here for another 20 minutes just spoon after spoon of this that's I just can't bring myself to do it one of us would look at the other and just say Savage just Savage you start to eat just like an absolute animal and you in like 30 seconds you do they say it's like chugging for food and so um we used to say that and it would be like all right we got to Savage it and we would just quickly down the whole thing now there's a version of that for businesses that's kind of what you described here was this guy was like oh okay people like this true crime audience pumping this out I'm gonna Savage it and so basically in two years to pump out 40 shows and get a hundred million downloads there's only one way to describe that he Savaged it and it he wasn't trying to be beautifully done I bet you it's imperfect in all these different ways you know he might have been hiring you know random voice actors and you know Paraguay and like doing whatever it took to get these out there and pump them out but that's exactly what he did and I think actually way more often than the beautifully done do you see people just Savage it and just just scale up like an absolute Savage because they find something that works and then they don't they're not perfectionists and they don't like um they they don't get limited by what's the normal Pace they're like and that works what's the theoretical limit of this and that works more I remember when I lived in San Francisco when I started the hustle I was like originally I was like let's just pump out blog posts and people are like well what about quality over quantity and I was like dude did you bring yourself to work again yeah I was like dude I well I was I would always turn on I go no our quality is quantity right like we are not we are not an article business we are like how many how how can these operations be where we pump out lots of Articles that's the product we're building you're not a journalist you're a blogger go go blog it was like and then another that was always one where like people are always like quality versus quantity and I'm like uh you need both or if I want to play with their heads I'd be like no the quality is the quantity another thing where people would say is like uh well it's a marathon not a Sprint and that was like a a reason for them to slack and I'm like yeah but have you ever ran a marathon at world record Pace it's gonna feel like a Sprint so like you know it feels pretty fast when you're running real like top marathoners we're running fast so it's gonna feel like a Sprint uh but yeah this guy is a quantity over quality guy and I love it yeah I love it exactly okay I think we should uh we should wrap it here that's the pond [Music]\"\n",

       "[Document(page_content=\"what are the best layer 2 token Investments going into this next bull market I've said I expect uh layer twos to be part of the Mania in the next when everyone gets crazy about crypto thousands of l2s launching is where the excitement's going to be and and then I'm going to make my next video talking about the scams to watch out for that also always comes with the crazy bull but in this video I want to talk about where the best places to put your money are now I've invested through eight bubbles I've done well but I'm not a trained financial advisor and I'm not corrupt enough for Golem Gensler so do your own research now before I even get into this I want to I want to explain my investment philosophy and I just I just tweeted uh my Twitter Dave LaVine zerom I just tweeted this because I saw a video with two of the biggest Tech Venture capitalists Brad gersner Bill Gurley made a video and and I tweeted that at 28 minutes and 20 seconds Bill Gurley says the largest companies have the highest growth rates and they talk about this for a little while and at 35 minutes and 12 seconds Brad gersner says no one feels smart investing in the big companies investors have been grossly underinvested in the big companies who have done the best and they talk about this for 10 to 15 minutes which is something that I have said for a long time stop chasing the tiny new everybody wants the shiny new and I've been saying this and to me it just seems like this old hardened rule that is so obvious and I don't understand why people don't see it however they talked in this video about how this is a bit of a new phenomenon I was like oh yeah you know it used to be that the big companies became large and slow and were always disrupted and and it was almost easier to find those and it was but a and you know for me it's not a new phenomena because I've always invested in the tech high growth Tech and I and I think you know why is this the phenomena why do the biggest companies seem to outperform and my theory is that do these internet-based businesses where Network effects are so powerful Network effects are even more powerful than we understand because we see it in in large things that totally suck they just still maintain their lead so imagine if you have good Tech and you're the leader like so my investment philosophy in this video one of the best investments no it's not going to be the tiny new things launching in six months that I you know no it is not yeah the small new it's also not oh let's buy a 100 and hope that one of them and I could make a whole video and go on on why that method I The Venture Capital method buy 10 one of them makes the whole portfolio that method most Venture capitalists don't make any money and they suck first of all so I don't even know that that method works but the they just pick the leaders it's just so easy and it wins That's My Philosophy you don't like it go find one of those guys drawing lines on charts telling you what's hot this week and buy their course okay so that being said you know okay so that makes me boring thus I have no followers but so what are the largest um the largest and established layer twos now let me also say did I make a video okay so okay let's reverse a little bit so the largest Network effect protocol is ethereum itself right which is eth which is not a layer two but in your excitement here don't go and dump don't forget about the king I think this should be 60 70% of your portfolio at least 50 and even our horrible Bitcoin at least 10% okay so you what you got left and you may have some other crazy ideas you want to do but so you know 10 to 20% of your portfolio in these layer twos your crypto portfolio that is okay and so for me it's like well who the leaders so boring right we've got now there's two types of layer twos you got the optimistic rollups and the ZK rollups bottom line is the ZK Tech long-term wins however it's brand new sort of just launching and they're not the biggest the optimistics has been around for a while and so they are the biggest and don't forget the possibility for example optimism is one of the large early optimistic rollups maybe they convert a lot of things to use this by the time ZK Tech is so much better optimistic sort of converts and adopts that Tech somehow right because it's not about the best tech it's not about the fastest and it's not about oh my God it's one tenth of a cheaper Network effects is so important okay so the fact that optimistic was first is a deal the fact that they're the biggest is important okay but keep your eye okay so as far as the optimistic rollups go we've got optimism I mentioned which is op and you've got arbitrum a RB these are the two biggest right now I made a video I just posted a video that talking about L2 beat you can go there to see who are the biggest l2s I mean just you know follow it that way now watch out for ones that they is they sell some stupid meme coin with a monkey wearing a hat and so the whole chain is huge for a week that doesn't mean biggest means actual long-term big right you know consistently not just big for week cuz that happens um so you've got those two now with OP they one thing you sort of want to do and and these things honestly also if you're just you know you're watching this because you're interested in crypto you like it you own some Bitcoin and ethereum and you're in coinbase I don't think you play this game I think you got to be on chain for this like maybe they sell these tokens in coinbase I don't even know but to me if you're not on chain it's just you're not in crypto and what are you doing here with the 10 to 15% of your portfolio I think it's and and so anyways but if you're on chain and op you want to lock this up in the governance where you're you delegate somebody to do your voting for you because they've done some aird drops I think they'll keep doing air drops and you get more op for free if you do that and you use the token on chain you're going to get free tokens uh AR I don't think arbitrum has been doing that now another thing to note both of these systems arbitr and optimism are issuing their software so that people can launch version chains optimistic chains arbitr chains that are all on their software so it's you've got you know EBAs layer goes to optimism you know and there's all these other layers twos but on the optimism chain they've got a bunch of chains going and one of their chains one of their biggest ones optimism is base which is coin bases Layer Two uh I don't know if you do like this or it's like this but whatever coinbase and and coinbase itself I all you know don't don't forget about coinbase as a crypto investment I think it's a little different it is a stock um and I don't know that I would buy it today it's up it was at 75 for a while it doubled it's come down a little ah watch that truck don't buy things when they're going straight up but I have like Bas partly and coin coin base partly because it's part and they're being very smart about the layer 2 strategy okay so we like those two then you know polygon okay so polygon and and I'm going to post a video I just listened to this video I think I tweeted it also I'll put it in the description below and maybe I'll put this other tweet that I mentioned at the beginning in the description as well polygon started they were early as a a side chain to ethereum and other words what it's not an official Layer Two thing about layer twos is they take the security they uh it's as when it's fully deployed it's as safe as being on the main chain polygon just launched like another chain it's like almost you could almost think of it like another L1 but they built it to was so integrated with ethereum they call it a side chain okay so it's not a layer two but they have they acquired the two best zero knowledge proof companies brought them in I built this thing and they're launching I don't know they call it polygon 2.0 the tokens going to convert from madic to P um and it's going to be I think the leading ZK rollup um now people have looked and I've had people comment to me oh you love polygon and it's not even on the list on l2b it's not even Layer Two why do you think it's the best it hasn't really launched yet their official Layer Two but when it does launch and again if you're interested listen to the video I put in the description below where it's going to have like a data availab it's going to have a version of um uh like a Celestia built into their Suite of uh products it's going to have an like an Igan L it's going to have the reaking it's going to have um it's just it's it's the best it's and and they have a huge it's probably it's one of the biggest chains out there and it's going to move to it so I believe you know I I don't I usually don't like to be early the before in the predict but polygon just keeps executing I have this is for me I made this 10% of my portfolio and it's probably less the 10 at this point because it hasn't moved this price nobody likes it because it's not the story of the week it hasn't launched yet that's when I like things I know I'm so boring go to a guy who's telling you go to another YouTube channel hurry to someone who's telling you what's going up tomorrow it's like my my mother every time she asks about a stock or Tesla you like it well you know do I like it if it doesn't go up tomorrow she doesn't want to buy it for 30 years I don't have that long I need to know it's going to go up tomorrow never buys anything okay so uh um polygon did I want to say anything else about that um no okay now oh another point about polygon and even the rollups in general there's an issue that people talk about you know you've got and I and I talked about this in my other video uh Solana against versus ethereum video that I just made I'm going to make a playlist on my channel YouTube Dave LaVine zom and I I'll do a tweet that has all of the videos in this L2 series The One solot versus ethereum which really was talking about one chain to do everything versus you know what we're seeing on ethereum and all the other chains really is this it's going to be chains like this you know it's it's it's a fractal right of of freaking chains right I can do this all day and but the but the concern everyone's head is well what if I got something here I I want to communicate with this one you know I got a I got a decentralized exchange and there's liquidity on all these well that's it's you're splitting up your liquidity or what if it's even on another one it's over here and here and here this issue definitely is solved in the long run I'm a little little concerned that it could be one of these things oh yeah we're going to solve it it takes long much longer than we expect however it's looking a little bit faster than I feared a while ago and polygon specifically their thing when they launched they he was talking specifically they're going to have a feature where if you go and you launch your own chain app built right in you can tap into liquidity and all the other polygon chains right and op their model of having their their all these other little opans I think they're going to have comp I I think the composability is going to be solved maybe the composability is not as easy as it is on salana you can watch that video for the for the pros and cons there um but but there was that okay next the other phenomena we are seeing with l2s is uh you know what they call an app chain now these are just simply applications that not only say oh I want to go to the new layer 2 Chain because it's faster cheaper and all that but they say we want to have our own chain and one of my one of my favorite tokens when I say favorite it's couple percent of my portfolio it's one of these small maybe hopefully you know shoot for the mooners uh fracks right uh which is the fxs token they are launching like next month I believe the fraxel train no fra fraxel like fractal but fractal they're launching their own chain now I I already recommend and have held forever fxs um so now they're going to launch their new chain first of all launch launching their new chain I am not going to be the first one to jump onto the new chain okay and I don't advise everybody you can understand if you're in Bitcoin now you're early to crypto you're early to bitcoin these things are longterm stories I remember when I built my website in 1995 I was like oh God I'm so late it was invented in '94 didn't get on for a whole year right you know cloud everyone's going to move to the cloud this was invented in the 90s it's still if you look at the stats it's like percent of computing that has moved to the cloud like 25 you know some percent 30% of the Computing has moved to the cloud and that's over how many years 30 years we got a long way to go you are early you do not need to get on the new chain the week it launches and I understand if it all works out you're a little early make a little more money I'd rather be right and and and and and and for that safety lose take a little bit off the table then be the first one but have risk andoss disasters right so anyways this thing's going to launch and I'm going to watch it and as usual you know if after three or six months everything looks good everybody's and I'm seeing people are moving there then I will do the schlep because I've got staked fracks there's you you got staked fracks you've got fxs I don't know I mean I mostly just have fxs however you could have lots of things and to move everything onto this new chain is a whole schap that you don't want to have to do if the thing ends up not working out but anyways that is also going to be another story where certain applications get their own chain and then that creates some there's an air drop and then whatever Shenanigans everyone gets exciting and on the side I I wouldn't go chasing all that stuff you know and trying to be the first one and these airdrops everyone's so excited for an air drop it is free money but again it's just not just be in the big if you're in the big leader and you hold it for 5 to 10 years you're G to beat all of these monkeys running around chasing the narratives of the week guaranteed okay now also there is a lot more going on than I've even mentioned here and things that I don't follow gaming there's a lot going on with gaming the leader probably polygon with is it I IM immutable IMX or whatever and I just I don't do gaming because if you want to do gaming you should be getting on and playing the games and trying you know and I'm just it's not for me and there's a lot of there's going to be thousands of player two's launching and yes some of them are going to be amazing my Approach and and and this is what I advise most people to do a new layer 2 is launching and it's going to take over the world you believe great write it down and at it's it's going to go to the moon and then it's going to crash and you buy it in the next bubble probably cheaper remember the new hot thing that launches during the Mania right we're going to have the M you got the Mania and then the crash and here and so we're like here the stuff that launches and this one we're going to see lots of stuff launching between here and here you buy it two years later here right which might be cheaper than here so when the new stuff is all launching every week just yeah I everybody body's thinking again all these people who are chasing what's going to go up next week what's The Narrative of the week they're here and they're like oh my God I'm going to make money when I do it here and you're all going to get stuck buying the most here and you're going to lose your money it's what H it happens every cycle I've been through eight bubbles I've seen it over and over eight bubbles in my life not eight crypto Bubbles and crypto bubbles are the most fun and fast um but anyways so I wait I wait and I buy it here and maybe it's here and two years later you buy it here but also when all the Press is is flying and everybody's chasing and everyone's excited about the new L2 it's very easy to believe a bunch of and predictions that don't come true and so when you're buying later it's not only it's probably the same price sometimes times lower often lower but you know it's actually good if you literally like it when it launches and you watch this thing and for two years and you still love it it's pretty good I had that with polygon I didn't get it at the I was like yeah we'll see you know and I didn't like cuz they didn't have in a layer two right chain link same thing chain link I mean everyone was yelling at me when chane link was here and here and here I said yeah you know what you're I just well some people said down here fine I was like I don't know then it got up it when it was expensive I was like oh wait I like and now you know what I like chain link fine I waited so I bought it here instead of buying it here I bought it here right I lost a little bit but it was a threeyear weight and you know what there's aund different things that you could buy around here but but after the crash you only like one or two of them again better to be right than a little early um okay so that's all I want to say I'm gonna make one more video on this topic next video will be about what to watch out for because the scams and the hopium that is going to come with all this stuff I think it's just you know we've seen it all before you know the types with the with the scams and oh my God and get rich quick and all that stuff that stuff also follows a pattern and I think we're going to see that come and I'm going to give you some warnings on what to watch out for all right but anyway so with this video again uh well comment below let me know blah blah you know anyways I'm Twitter at Twitter Dave

      "what are the best layer 2 token Investments going into this next bull market I've said I expect uh layer twos to be part of the Mania in the next when everyone gets crazy about crypto thousands of l2s launching is where the excitement's going to be and and then I'm going to make my next video talking about the scams to watch out for that also always comes with the crazy bull but in this video I want to talk about where the best places to put your money are now I've invested through eight bubbles I've done well but I'm not a trained financial advisor and I'm not corrupt enough for Golem Gensler so do your own research now before I even get into this I want to I want to explain my investment philosophy and I just I just tweeted uh my Twitter Dave LaVine zerom I just tweeted this because I saw a video with two of the biggest Tech Venture capitalists Brad gersner Bill Gurley made a video and and I tweeted that at 28 minutes and 20 seconds Bill Gurley says the largest companies have the highest growth rates and they talk about this for a little while and at 35 minutes and 12 seconds Brad gersner says no one feels smart investing in the big companies investors have been grossly underinvested in the big companies who have done the best and they talk about this for 10 to 15 minutes which is something that I have said for a long time stop chasing the tiny new everybody wants the shiny new and I've been saying this and to me it just seems like this old hardened rule that is so obvious and I don't understand why people don't see it however they talked in this video about how this is a bit of a new phenomenon I was like oh yeah you know it used to be that the big companies became large and slow and were always disrupted and and it was almost easier to find those and it was but a and you know for me it's not a new phenomena because I've always invested in the tech high growth Tech and I and I think you know why is this the phenomena why do the biggest companies seem to outperform and my theory is that do these internet-based businesses where Network effects are so powerful Network effects are even more powerful than we understand because we see it in in large things that totally suck they just still maintain their lead so imagine if you have good Tech and you're the leader like so my investment philosophy in this video one of the best investments no it's not going to be the tiny new things launching in six months that I you know no it is not yeah the small new it's also not oh let's buy a 100 and hope that one of them and I could make a whole video and go on on why that method I The Venture Capital method buy 10 one of them makes the whole portfolio that method most Venture capitalists don't make any money and they suck first of all so I don't even know that that method works but the they just pick the leaders it's just so easy and it wins That's My Philosophy you don't like it go find one of those guys drawing lines on charts telling you what's hot this week and buy their course okay so that being said you know okay so that makes me boring thus I have no followers but so what are the largest um the largest and established layer twos now let me also say did I make a video okay so okay let's reverse a little bit so the largest Network effect protocol is ethereum itself right which is eth which is not a layer two but in your excitement here don't go and dump don't forget about the king I think this should be 60 70% of your portfolio at least 50 and even our horrible Bitcoin at least 10% okay so you what you got left and you may have some other crazy ideas you want to do but so you know 10 to 20% of your portfolio in these layer twos your crypto portfolio that is okay and so for me it's like well who the leaders so boring right we've got now there's two types of layer twos you got the optimistic rollups and the ZK rollups bottom line is the ZK Tech long-term wins however it's brand new sort of just launching and they're not the biggest the optimistics has been around for a while and so they are the biggest and don't forget the possibility for example optimism is one of the large early optimistic rollups maybe they convert a lot of things to use this by the time ZK Tech is so much better optimistic sort of converts and adopts that Tech somehow right because it's not about the best tech it's not about the fastest and it's not about oh my God it's one tenth of a cheaper Network effects is so important okay so the fact that optimistic was first is a deal the fact that they're the biggest is important okay but keep your eye okay so as far as the optimistic rollups go we've got optimism I mentioned which is op and you've got arbitrum a RB these are the two biggest right now I made a video I just posted a video that talking about L2 beat you can go there to see who are the biggest l2s I mean just you know follow it that way now watch out for ones that they is they sell some stupid meme coin with a monkey wearing a hat and so the whole chain is huge for a week that doesn't mean biggest means actual long-term big right you know consistently not just big for week cuz that happens um so you've got those two now with OP they one thing you sort of want to do and and these things honestly also if you're just you know you're watching this because you're interested in crypto you like it you own some Bitcoin and ethereum and you're in coinbase I don't think you play this game I think you got to be on chain for this like maybe they sell these tokens in coinbase I don't even know but to me if you're not on chain it's just you're not in crypto and what are you doing here with the 10 to 15% of your portfolio I think it's and and so anyways but if you're on chain and op you want to lock this up in the governance where you're you delegate somebody to do your voting for you because they've done some aird drops I think they'll keep doing air drops and you get more op for free if you do that and you use the token on chain you're going to get free tokens uh AR I don't think arbitrum has been doing that now another thing to note both of these systems arbitr and optimism are issuing their software so that people can launch version chains optimistic chains arbitr chains that are all on their software so it's you've got you know EBAs layer goes to optimism you know and there's all these other layers twos but on the optimism chain they've got a bunch of chains going and one of their chains one of their biggest ones optimism is base which is coin bases Layer Two uh I don't know if you do like this or it's like this but whatever coinbase and and coinbase itself I all you know don't don't forget about coinbase as a crypto investment I think it's a little different it is a stock um and I don't know that I would buy it today it's up it was at 75 for a while it doubled it's come down a little ah watch that truck don't buy things when they're going straight up but I have like Bas partly and coin coin base partly because it's part and they're being very smart about the layer 2 strategy okay so we like those two then you know polygon okay so polygon and and I'm going to post a video I just listened to this video I think I tweeted it also I'll put it in the description below and maybe I'll put this other tweet that I mentioned at the beginning in the description as well polygon started they were early as a a side chain to ethereum and other words what it's not an official Layer Two thing about layer twos is they take the security they uh it's as when it's fully deployed it's as safe as being on the main chain polygon just launched like another chain it's like almost you could almost think of it like another L1 but they built it to was so integrated with ethereum they call it a side chain okay so it's not a layer two but they have they acquired the two best zero knowledge proof companies brought them in I built this thing and they're launching I don't know they call it polygon 2.0 the tokens going to convert from madic to P um and it's going to be I think the leading ZK rollup um now people have looked and I've had people comment to me oh you love polygon and it's not even on the list on l2b it's not even Layer Two why do you think it's the best it hasn't really launched yet their official Layer Two but when it does launch and again if you're interested listen to the video I put in the description below where it's going to have like a data availab it's going to have a version of um uh like a Celestia built into their Suite of uh products it's going to have an like an Igan L it's going to have the reaking it's going to have um it's just it's it's the best it's and and they have a huge it's probably it's one of the biggest chains out there and it's going to move to it so I believe you know I I don't I usually don't like to be early the before in the predict but polygon just keeps executing I have this is for me I made this 10% of my portfolio and it's probably less the 10 at this point because it hasn't moved this price nobody likes it because it's not the story of the week it hasn't launched yet that's when I like things I know I'm so boring go to a guy who's telling you go to another YouTube channel hurry to someone who's telling you what's going up tomorrow it's like my my mother every time she asks about a stock or Tesla you like it well you know do I like it if it doesn't go up tomorrow she doesn't want to buy it for 30 years I don't have that long I need to know it's going to go up tomorrow never buys anything okay so uh um polygon did I want to say anything else about that um no okay now oh another point about polygon and even the rollups in general there's an issue that people talk about you know you've got and I and I talked about this in my other video uh Solana against versus ethereum video that I just made I'm going to make a playlist on my channel YouTube Dave LaVine zom and I I'll do a tweet that has all of the videos in this L2 series The One solot versus ethereum which really was talking about one chain to do everything versus you know what we're seeing on ethereum and all the other chains really is this it's going to be chains like this you know it's it's it's a fractal right of of freaking chains right I can do this all day and but the but the concern everyone's head is well what if I got something here I I want to communicate with this one you know I got a I got a decentralized exchange and there's liquidity on all these well that's it's you're splitting up your liquidity or what if it's even on another one it's over here and here and here this issue definitely is solved in the long run I'm a little little concerned that it could be one of these things oh yeah we're going to solve it it takes long much longer than we expect however it's looking a little bit faster than I feared a while ago and polygon specifically their thing when they launched they he was talking specifically they're going to have a feature where if you go and you launch your own chain app built right in you can tap into liquidity and all the other polygon chains right and op their model of having their their all these other little opans I think they're going to have comp I I think the composability is going to be solved maybe the composability is not as easy as it is on salana you can watch that video for the for the pros and cons there um but but there was that okay next the other phenomena we are seeing with l2s is uh you know what they call an app chain now these are just simply applications that not only say oh I want to go to the new layer 2 Chain because it's faster cheaper and all that but they say we want to have our own chain and one of my one of my favorite tokens when I say favorite it's couple percent of my portfolio it's one of these small maybe hopefully you know shoot for the mooners uh fracks right uh which is the fxs token they are launching like next month I believe the fraxel train no fra fraxel like fractal but fractal they're launching their own chain now I I already recommend and have held forever fxs um so now they're going to launch their new chain first of all launch launching their new chain I am not going to be the first one to jump onto the new chain okay and I don't advise everybody you can understand if you're in Bitcoin now you're early to crypto you're early to bitcoin these things are longterm stories I remember when I built my website in 1995 I was like oh God I'm so late it was invented in '94 didn't get on for a whole year right you know cloud everyone's going to move to the cloud this was invented in the 90s it's still if you look at the stats it's like percent of computing that has moved to the cloud like 25 you know some percent 30% of the Computing has moved to the cloud and that's over how many years 30 years we got a long way to go you are early you do not need to get on the new chain the week it launches and I understand if it all works out you're a little early make a little more money I'd rather be right and and and and and and for that safety lose take a little bit off the table then be the first one but have risk andoss disasters right so anyways this thing's going to launch and I'm going to watch it and as usual you know if after three or six months everything looks good everybody's and I'm seeing people are moving there then I will do the schlep because I've got staked fracks there's you you got staked fracks you've got fxs I don't know I mean I mostly just have fxs however you could have lots of things and to move everything onto this new chain is a whole schap that you don't want to have to do if the thing ends up not working out but anyways that is also going to be another story where certain applications get their own chain and then that creates some there's an air drop and then whatever Shenanigans everyone gets exciting and on the side I I wouldn't go chasing all that stuff you know and trying to be the first one and these airdrops everyone's so excited for an air drop it is free money but again it's just not just be in the big if you're in the big leader and you hold it for 5 to 10 years you're G to beat all of these monkeys running around chasing the narratives of the week guaranteed okay now also there is a lot more going on than I've even mentioned here and things that I don't follow gaming there's a lot going on with gaming the leader probably polygon with is it I IM immutable IMX or whatever and I just I don't do gaming because if you want to do gaming you should be getting on and playing the games and trying you know and I'm just it's not for me and there's a lot of there's going to be thousands of player two's launching and yes some of them are going to be amazing my Approach and and and this is what I advise most people to do a new layer 2 is launching and it's going to take over the world you believe great write it down and at it's it's going to go to the moon and then it's going to crash and you buy it in the next bubble probably cheaper remember the new hot thing that launches during the Mania right we're going to have the M you got the Mania and then the crash and here and so we're like here the stuff that launches and this one we're going to see lots of stuff launching between here and here you buy it two years later here right which might be cheaper than here so when the new stuff is all launching every week just yeah I everybody body's thinking again all these people who are chasing what's going to go up next week what's The Narrative of the week they're here and they're like oh my God I'm going to make money when I do it here and you're all going to get stuck buying the most here and you're going to lose your money it's what H it happens every cycle I've been through eight bubbles I've seen it over and over eight bubbles in my life not eight crypto Bubbles and crypto bubbles are the most fun and fast um but anyways so I wait I wait and I buy it here and maybe it's here and two years later you buy it here but also when all the Press is is flying and everybody's chasing and everyone's excited about the new L2 it's very easy to believe a bunch of and predictions that don't come true and so when you're buying later it's not only it's probably the same price sometimes times lower often lower but you know it's actually good if you literally like it when it launches and you watch this thing and for two years and you still love it it's pretty good I had that with polygon I didn't get it at the I was like yeah we'll see you know and I didn't like cuz they didn't have in a layer two right chain link same thing chain link I mean everyone was yelling at me when chane link was here and here and here I said yeah you know what you're I just well some people said down here fine I was like I don't know then it got up it when it was expensive I was like oh wait I like and now you know what I like chain link fine I waited so I bought it here instead of buying it here I bought it here right I lost a little bit but it was a threeyear weight and you know what there's aund different things that you could buy around here but but after the crash you only like one or two of them again better to be right than a little early um okay so that's all I want to say I'm gonna make one more video on this topic next video will be about what to watch out for because the scams and the hopium that is going to come with all this stuff I think it's just you know we've seen it all before you know the types with the with the scams and oh my God and get rich quick and all that stuff that stuff also follows a pattern and I think we're going to see that come and I'm going to give you some warnings on what to watch out for all right but anyway so with this video again uh well comment below let me know blah blah you know anyways I'm Twitter at Twitter Dave LaVine Z the number zc YouTube Dave line.com thanks watch\n"

       "\"Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all [Music] day hello Joe how are you my friend I'm great man I'm psyched to be here cheers sir cheers brother har Krishna har Krishna great to see you always that's good my friend it's a strange times and uh we're both departing this land I know for greener Fosters I keep thinking back to when we first became friends in the strange path since from there to here and all our predictions and all the things that we we never would have imagined this you know specifically like that there would be this [\\xa0__\\xa0] Global pandemic that we would suddenly be like some kind of like Refugee is way too dramatic a word for it but suddenly just part of this diaspora of comedians pouring out of La like and not just comedians but just people leave leaving man well um I talked to Joey today from New Jersey called you know I called him he's in New Jersey and it was just such so strange I'm like you're in Jersey he's like that's right [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah you know he's he's all happy in Jersey you know he was the last like you leaving was intense but I was still like you know maybe we'll stick around and see what happens and then like I'd been getting all these you know the problem with me is like I get weird Vibes all the time and like the last I was on here I legitimately thought a meteor was going to hit the earth I I really thought that so I I work very hard on not listening to that part of me most of the time but I was getting this real weird vibe from LA and I'm like come on man you're just like superstitious it's it's probably nothing and then then my wife would say like I'm getting a really weird vibe like we maybe maybe I don't know if we should stay here renting if we stay in the place and I didn't want to tell her oh I've been getting a weird vibe too cuz I didn't want to amplify whatever that was and then I got on the phone with Diaz and he's like yeah I'm leaving getting the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of here and that was it Diaz was telling me Burbank was sketchy where he lives in Burbank CU my neighborhood turned the [\\xa0__\\xa0] like instantly dude it's like yeah it's it's it's not and it's not just any one thing you know it's like not just like some of the stuff I get stuff had to get shut down and because stuff was shut down it got a little more weathered than usual and it's like the you know the homeless encampments I was an Echo Park man and like I really feel like you know like the red State people one of the things they love to tweet is like don't bring your liberal [\\xa0__\\xa0] here right and right well this that's where I'm eating [\\xa0__\\xa0] a little bit because you know I am I do still believe that we need to uh decriminalize drugs that the the drug policy's [\\xa0__\\xa0] the way we're handling it's all wrong but they there used to be a way that they could get people who are like camping out on the streets and a lot of the times that was possession of like illegal drugs and because that that stuff got removed uh suddenly you were witnessing like holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] man there's people who are making like real like ra a rational decision from the perspective of a heroin addict which is they love heroin so much you know that Doug Stan hope joke some things are better than life like they love heroin so much they're addicted to it they love it and the shelters that are apparently available won't let them do drugs in the shelters they want you to kick it yeah and so that's ridiculous but now I could be wrong about that but that is what I've heard as one of the reasons these people are staying out in the street is not cuz they don't want to be in a shelter it's because they don't want to be prevented from getting hot and so this has produced this like situation in a lot of the big cities which is we're seeing like massive tent cities and by the way the Tent City thing aesthetically it's not uh it's not the best look but the stuff that I began to experienc in Echo Park man I took I I took my kid to the playground right and there's like a dude that looks like he emerged from a time portal from an apocalypse you know what I mean I'm not talking about like you know run-of-the-mill like somebody who's a junkie who's like I'm talking like covered in like soot like pure dilated eyes not wearing like you know the disheveled clothes you might expect from someone who's been addicted to heroin for a long time but like wearing like like he broke into wherever the costumes from Mad Max were like some kind of weird leather vest thing and like like creepy [\\xa0__\\xa0] cut off shorts and he had a a machete oh Jesus and he's throwing it into the ground of the playground and pulling it out like he's practicing throwing a machete I'm with my [\\xa0__\\xa0] toddler man and you know it's like and so obviously we didn't go to the playground but that was you know my you know it was not uncommon in that area to see completely naked people just not that that's bad but not naked like the way covered in dirt wandering aimlessly you do even worse than wandering aimlessly wandering with what seems to be a purpose in their eyes some of them seeming like they're late where the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are you going naked that you're laid for like are you being summoned like that was that was but that wasn't just it man you know it's a lot of other things too and it all just started piling on top of dude I don't think this is sustainable living in giant groups of people I think it's when it's when it works great it was wonderful when when La was was working well it was fantastic when The Comedy Store was packed and restaurants were doing well and the economy was doing well and the crime wasn't high it's great but when things go bad there's no sense of community so then there's a sense of like people capitalizing on other people who either own stores or who aren't home or whatever people who are Des there's to there's too many people yeah if you're in a community that's a small town and something goes wrong you can kind of bunch up together and help each other yeah cuz you feel like you need each other and you feel like you're you're a part of something people don't feel like they're a part of something here they're all transient everybody's moved here from someone else from somewhere else everybody thinks they can go somewhere else and they can and they probably will I mean I you know we all came from different you were North Carolina I came from uh New York at the time we all everybody who comes to LA in Show Business God what are the percentage of like how many do we know that are just straight la like Christina pizitz she's straight La who else um Sebastian came from Chicago Theo came from Nashville did Nashville is that he came from noou no Louisiana that's right I mean Joey obviously Jersey yeah well gywn which is something I've always loved about it I've loved that element of like just this wild vortex artist and narcissists and people who just Gane and like it's a lot of Sparks Fly in in that kind of insane cauldron of identity all that stuff is super cool it's it's beautiful that's one of the things I loved about is like the place we all know this is the place is a place where you make illusion that was the idea you make things that aren't real seem real and people like to watch that that's the whole TV movie industry the whole place is based on it cre creting an identity that you like somehow monetize or a studio makes monetizes your identity or something it was something magical and beautiful in all of that but not it seems like there's a real emperor where's no clo thing happening right now not just in LA and but I feel bad talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] about La cuz man she's been so good to both of us I this city is like I will always love this place it's not the problem is not the city this is the this I've been thinking about this a lot lately and here's an issue um I am Progressive on just about every issue across the board yeah uh gay rights civil rights women's rights whatever women's right to choose fill in the blank Pro Medicaid Pro Universal basic in um um Pro so many things but there's a thing that happens in large cities where large cities are always blue and I'm trying to figure this out cuz like New York is and I used to think it's oh it's because they're educated you know and educated people are more likely to be compassionate and compassionate people more likely to be Democrats but there's a balance that has to be achieved and when the [\\xa0__\\xa0] hits the fan you need Law and Order and I think that some people who are Democrats who are pro Progressive people they don't understand that aspect of human nature or they want to deny that aspect of human nature like when the mayor of Seattle was dealing with that whole six area lock down little small little country that they had put up barriers and [\\xa0__\\xa0] and and like literally were had armed guards there that uh what was it called again Chop Chop or Chaz right the the mayor said maybe this is our Summer of Love Like no it's not Summer of Love some people took over other people's businesses with Force like just because they think the way you think or they subscribe to Liberal ideas like you like you're a liberal too so the this is like your gang of thugs that you have to support when they take over other people's businesses no we have to be able to call out everybody and just because somebody is on your side you can't let them take over city blocks and just Institute their own government and then say it's the summer of love this is crazy talk and this is how this is gets get cities destroyed and this is what gets the police defunded and this what what gets people saying crazy things like we we need to disband release everyone from prison and no more prisons and no more laws and no more police and like no no the way things go well is you have to be safe the only way you're safe is if you have a strong military and a strong police force and there's something about liberals that don't want to believe that they see the bad cops they see these videos and we all agree we got to get rid of bad cops they got to reform the police they have to but those are not all the cops that's crazy you just only see the bad no one's no one's filming excellent interactions with friendly cops and compliant uh people that's not you're filming not going to get a lot of but that's the majority of these interactions but we have this distorted perception based on what we're exposed to which is viral videos of cops being [\\xa0__\\xa0] cuz there are cops that are [\\xa0__\\xa0] because there's people that are [\\xa0__\\xa0] and there's who knows how many [\\xa0__\\xa0] hundreds of thousands if not millions of cops there are the odds that they're not hundreds and thousands of [\\xa0__\\xa0] is is outrageous well you know what I've been doing with this whole [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing man uh because if I get because because you know me the way my mind goes is not going to be like red State Consciousness when it comes to that [\\xa0__\\xa0] cuz when I saw that autonomous Zone pop up I'm like let's do it baby spread it out come on but what did you think would be good what could good could have come of that well I mean the history of America is is is is this in beautiful yet somewhat like there's a there's a Mania a utopian Mania in the heart of I think the American Spirit which is like Americans identify with this it's you know and George Carin did a great job of desica it by saying it's called The American Dream because you got to be asleep to believe it I love that joke but I love the American dream and the what's so beautiful about it is it's this idea of like I think together we can do something new that's going to be better than anything that happened before and from that Spirit you get all great Innovation that goes across all political ideologies right so to me you know and they always call it I've always loved that they call it the American experiment [\\xa0__\\xa0] love that man cuz it's an experiment it's like let's see what we could do here together and for an experiment to work we need to be able to look at what didn't work in the experiment and improve upon it now that being said it's like for me I've been trying to like pull myself out of the even though I I identify as a progressive I'm going to vote Democrat I'm that's just what I'm going to do but that being said I try to pull myself out of that cuz I don't want to be cubby hold man and I have a lot of friends who are like hardcore conservatives and I know that there is this idea and I think a lot of the the idea gets perpetrated by people who are into tribalism blue red and so the the blue people they propagate a conceptualization of the red people which is kind of what you said that well they're not compassionate yeah it's like shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up ridiculous get the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of here these are some of the most compassionate people I've ever met in my [\\xa0__\\xa0] life they would die for people that they've never met they do you think a big problem is the figurehead right now the Republican party is Trump and Trump is such a polarized figure and he doesn't seem to have much empathy if if any seem you know I mean that's it's you don't know who he is really because you don't talk to him privately but his public Persona is that of a winner who doesn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] and you're fired I mean that's that's a non-empathetic perspective and we ass associate people who support him with also lacking empathy then you add into it children in cages at at the border and you see those videos you know what bothered me more than anything about the kids in cages there was one video that really bothered me where Mike Pence went to visit like he's on the ground like next to the cages see if you can find that Mike Pence visiting the the Border cages now apparently these cages had been put up through Obama and that's what's interesting about this whole border wall and Border discussion and immigration discussion cuz Obama particularly when he was running for president he was very tough on illegal immigration I mean he uh he said a lot of the same things that Trump said if you listen to the speeches that Obama said people believed him and agreed with him because it wasn't a republican talking point it was just a safety talking point and he was also a way that he could get people that were more like more concerned about the problem with illegal immigration or more you know he could he could tie that up with just saying listen we have to follow the rule of law and you know they they had the these talks and they built these these cages they did that during the Obama Administration right uh yeah see if you can so here here's this so sir these These are the guys that fled from Mexico and who knows where else and came through the Mexican border and then Pence is standing there in front of these guys so like imagine you're a dude you live in you know Ecuador and you make your way up through Mexico because you have a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dream like America is the land where people can make it this is this guy who fights in the UFC his name is Marlon Vera and uh he's a bad [\\xa0__\\xa0] and he just won this weekend and he's I believe he's from Ecuador right that's Marlon's yes and he um talked about it in his his victory speech he was talking about you know how hey man you know you can you can actually do it he came over here he was talking about in the countdown show too he came over here he lived a year without his family just building up money fighting to try to get money to bring his family over and then he brought his family over and then as time has gone on he keeps winning he's on like a seven fight win streak and now he's like a top 10 contender in the UFC and he could have been one of those dudes that's right see this this this is not these are just people that are in a [\\xa0__\\xa0] terrible place and they're trying to get out putting them in cages like it just it's a bad look and it's an even worse imagine you're that guy who comes over from Ecuador and you're in this cage and you see Pence he could touch him you could touch him if that cage was in there you could reach over and touch him on the shoulder right there the [\\xa0__\\xa0] guy who's second in line to the the the most powerful Army the world has ever known the the Trump's the commander-in-chief that's number two yeah and he's right there in front of a cage and he doesn't seem to care like play this it's weird and I don't know how I want him to to look but he's not like looking at the people he's kind of like looking away he's kind of like ignoring the people I mean I don't know what you're supposed to do are you supposed to look at them would that would it fill you with sorrow and despair would you not be able to uh rationalize and disconnect yourself from the humans that are suffering when you think about all of us were basically the products of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] enormous chain of events not one thing but look at they they have foil blankets man I mean this is crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] they're stacked in there stacked on top of each other wearing foil blankets yeah it's terrible that and it's look at that guys think about kids yes he's got a family back home no no his kids got separated from him yeah that too that's what he's thinking about and you know the and again man it's like I keep trying to uh get out of the like I I keep trying to get out because I I this is what I've realized because I love flipping through I go from I will jump back and forth from like Fox News to CNN MSNBC I'll check out some Tucker Carlson blast over to Rachel mat find these like like M Polar Opposites and what I feel like what's happening just as a result of the entertainment that is news is that we're getting a very non- nuanced uh we're being told what we are basically do you listen to the or watch the hill no you should watch Rising the hill it's uh Crystal and Sager and Sager is a Republican and Crystal is a Democrat and but both of them super smart and really rational and they're honest they're honest and they they're nonpartisan and they break things down based on their honest interpretation of what's going on and it's so refreshing these two right here crystal ball and Sager and Getty they are [\\xa0__\\xa0] fantastic and they I love the fact that they're friends yet she's left he's right it's not [\\xa0__\\xa0] they're not frauds you think her real name is Crystal Ball um if I my last name is ball I'd name my daughter Crystal it's dope come on you would not I call her magic crystal ball like I don't know man well cuz then every cuz you do that and you're gonna like I didn't even notice it until now because I'm not neophobic I'm not name my name is duning I am how do you think I I I just I'm sensitive to names like that CU if their real name is Crystal Ball be a third grader named crystal ball have fun well third grader you might be able to get away with it but 10th grade you're going to get tortured by the time girls reach 15 he crystal balls you know it's like a never ending you know anyway what I'm that to me it's like the the propaganda it's propaganda and uh the the reality of it is like I I I'm trying to figure out what do we all have in common it sounds like a Cheesy thing and what we all have in common is we want to be happy yeah when I talk to my my my liberal friends they want to be happy when I talk to my conservative friends they want to Bey happy and then you add to it now this is where [\\xa0__\\xa0] gets weird a lot of people want to be a hero and why wouldn't you a lot of people want to help other people they have a service mentality they would they want to die for something good A lot of people really do want to help and then that's to me where the problem start is because that's being subverted and the way it's being subverted is you know what sucks man when you're around somebody who's telling you how you feel yeah have you ever had that happen where you're around someone they're like why are you unhappy today and you're not unhappy but if you're not careful you'll be like maybe I'm unhappy and then you then you become the unhappy thing and they've like sucked you into a thing you're not and so for me this is the danger of the news is they kind of tell us how we are how we feel they first of all this ridiculous red blue [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's like stop I mean every single person I've ever met would I I don't think I've ever met anybody who wouldn't try to help someone who is drowning I think most people I meet would are like that and I think that transcends politics but somehow they got got us thinking we're all different and separate and then on top of it the thing that really bothers me and annoys me obviously man I'm no [\\xa0__\\xa0] Trump fan that guy's a lunatic and he's driving people crazy but what bothers me he is it's like can you pass that lder you're right no for sure he's driving people nuts and and it's just the way you said it and and and and and what what bothers me is that the response from like really intelligent people who consider themselves uh liberals is they're shaming these people they're shaming them they're saying oh they're idiots they're rednecks they're dumb they're peasants the stupid peasants how could you like them it's like how they liked this guy because they thought that he was going to help their families they were [\\xa0__\\xa0] they were not doing great economically he they bought into a thing and they invested themselves in it and if they are starting to like it's Dawning on them that they succumb to another American tradition which is the con artist this is an American tradition it's American artist and it's American to get sucked in by one happens to the best of us it's happened to me at a Grateful Dead concert we wanted to buy 100 hits of [\\xa0__\\xa0] acid this son of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] got us a sheet of acid convinced us to try to sell it to make more money to get more acid we left there with one mushroom stem on the way back to Hendersonville I've been conned I know what it's like it's a very American thing but it's like so there was no asset at all dude he's no he we got we took our money to buy acid and then he's like we could sell this acid and buy more acid and then you know we're like yeah let's do it and then he sold the acid I guess and then we were going to buy more the point is like he started a business what he my friend almost gave him his [\\xa0__\\xa0] car like this was a very charismatic hippie he was like looked exactly the way he'd expect him a [\\xa0__\\xa0] hippie bandana big hippie beard some people are good at that and it's weird and they do weird things like they talk a little too close to you to make you uncomfortable yeah they use uh what's it neurolinguistic programming they like they like they just get you and they know how to talk you you know when I used to work at Newport crey uh some I'd work the register sometimes and we had lessons on how to deal with Flim Flam artists that's what they called them flimflam artists so they would teach you so we had to uh sit there and be taught like how someone will [\\xa0__\\xa0] you up like soell something will cost three bucks and they'll give you a 20 and they'll say hey uh can you give me a 10 and a five and then the rest in quarters and you're like what how much is that and then before you know and he's saying something else and talking over you and you think you owe him $40 like you're giving him more money he like I gave you 50 so you give me the 20 that 20 and then what is it it was three bucks so you owe me 47 so like before you know it you're giving money away and you don't understand what's happening especially when you're a kid I was like I think I was 16 when I was working there I was a monkey basically a monkey right and you know these people travel all over the place and they do this to folks they just trick them they pickpocket them like watching David bla do car tricks okay from as close as you are to me I don't get it I don't know what he's doing he can get me every time he's he's going to trick me every time he's so good at it and there's guys that are I don't know if they're at that level but there's guys at a level that you or I can't perceive and they'll steal your watch like there's guys who can get your watch off yeah like they can get your watch off I don't know how they do it but it's a known thing it's a known thing the guys know how to get your watch off [\\xa0__\\xa0] guys I mean how many videos on YouTube there's awesome videos of like children doing this to people you could see like kids like get trained to do this it's like they it's hacking our operating system essentially he stuffed a card into my friend Jeff's watch band and Jeff didn't even know it was in there and he's like look it's there and he's like what he looks at his watchband he'll like pull it out and it's the card he was looking for folded up tucked into his watch P you're like what what did you just do so if that guy's a thief if he was like some like oh is this someone stealing something yeah there's a whole genre of YouTube video oh boy look at that wow little tiny kids y they're trained wow they're trained to steal they practice Yeah they practice to do it I mean this is just a look we see this on the human realm and we're like oh my God they're children you see a coral reef and a little fish come and take food from another fish it's like just totally normal I mean it's not even this is just part of being in a hive you know did that guy just steal that guy's watch is that what just happened bro back that up that was crazy look watch how this guy bumps into this guy he takes his watch watch this is that what he did no no the guy still had a watch on what did he steal I don't know I think the bottles you'll never know I'm I'm too high for this I'm too high for this but i' I've never seen anybody take someone's watch off but I know it's real thing like guys can actually take your watch off like I mean like one with a strap where they do the Buckle it's annoying for you to do yeah dude I like to me this is a natural part of the environment we're in how many things camouflage themselves as other things take energy out of a system using the camouflage it's completely [\\xa0__\\xa0] normal it's nature so you you get this Trump and you get people who fell for it and now those people are deeply invested in that HP like magic trick which he did and by the way this is another thing it's like look you don't have to like somebody like I don't like Charles Manson yeah but man I do recognize like how [\\xa0__\\xa0] entertaining he is you know what I mean like that's a very entertaining cult leader similarly with Trump not a fan you know the moment he said he implied you should shoot looters all the look we can go on and on with antib I'm not I'm not talking about that I'm saying the problem is that that our tactic As Americans is not supposed to be we listen to the state and get our cues about how to be good people from the state our As Americans what we do is we have like basic fundamental ideas that are really [\\xa0__\\xa0] beautiful one of them being that we like believe that people have a right to be free and and seek their own personal happiness that's beautiful man that's not we shouldn't have the state telling us different versions of what that is we we have to be intelligent and autonomous enough to do that for ourselves and then from that like really be a a United States and and like what's happening now is these [\\xa0__\\xa0] uh are are not unifying us this is supposed to be the United States of America that's what it's supposed to be so if you're in a government official here and you're doing a thing that's making it all divided and [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and you're telling lies and you're shaming people for telling the truth it doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat whatever you are as as far as I'm concerned anti-American which is like man Americans and and [\\xa0__\\xa0] anybody who gets mad at me for saying this Americans are beautiful people we we both tour we get to meet people all over the [\\xa0__\\xa0] place and talk to them and they're always generally wonderful yes some of them will take your [\\xa0__\\xa0] watch you know what I mean but still still you know in general in general that you you encounter when things were going well see this is the thing that shifts everything is co the reason why everybody's ramped up I mean it's not no small feet it's not just about getting sick it's about everybody being scared that they're going to lose loved ones or they're going to die or they're going to lose lung function you can't work so you're worried about your income there's so many people whose businesses are eroding right before their eyes their eyes I mean imagine if you own commercial real estate now Jesus Christ and you you you you start thinking of the prospect of leasing a building that you invested all your money in out to some folks they're not going to have offices like that anymore people are going to do [\\xa0__\\xa0] from home there's a lot of people that are actually more productive working from home I know it's it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] up time so everybody's on eight everybody's walking around on eight trying to keep it together that's right and so a guy like trump exacerbates it cuz he doesn't ever come out with a Unity speech yeah it's always like a he's always the strong boss you're fired I'm the man it's I mean this is the message and it works with a lot of people it's a good look it's it's like comedy or music not not everything works on everybody but there's a lot of people that Vibe with his [\\xa0__\\xa0] real cartoonish version of being the boss right but it's not a bring everybody together thing and that's this is what we need we need the guy in the movie that stands on top of the hill the guy that says we have more ins similarity than we do that we disagree with man we're together we're friends most people most of our issues we could work out amicably we could talk most of our issues the vast majority and we need to not just dwell on those but Embrace those like embrace all the things we like we want safe schools for our kids we want Safe Streets we we want a um [\\xa0__\\xa0] Bridge maintenance so the bridges don't collapse we want everybody to be okay yeah we want no crime we want we we don't want unjust prison we don't want people being unjustly accused and then sentenced to life in jail and other people to work forever to get them we don't want any of that we don't want any prosecutors that hide evidence that shows that a person was innocent that's real today in 2020 they don't even get in trouble for it yeah man it's right it's it's true and I think that the only the maybe this is naive I think we got to get over our addiction to the person on the hill we got to get over our addiction to the idea that the way we govern is the only way to govern that's it and that's why when I see that what was it called again a Chaz you know again like yeah to me it's not to me what I'm seeing there is at the very least a radical experiment and a potential now it's a temper tantrum by some 20-year-old kids who hate capitalism how old were the founding fathers and that's a good question but they didn't have YouTube I think they would have formed a much better opinion well the the whole and this is the other part of it like so I I keep thinking about and again man this is where my case is going to start falling apart but that's okay I don't mind if my case falls apart the for me it's I keep thinking like okay so what are they telling us now how to feel they're saying well either you're a socialist or a capitalist or a communist or tell me what kind of IST I am or what ISM I'm into and I keep thinking like man can't there isn't it possible with all the technology we have that there's a new ISM that that no one's that doesn't have the first part of the word attached to it good point so it's like and and and so at the very least if you meet someone who's like in Passionate in a real way not in a [\\xa0__\\xa0] way by the way man because like there's a big difference between like you you know right away when you run into somebody who's trying to tell you how to be it's horrible it's a even even if it's in a light way it's such a it's so drones some like some people want you sick some people want you destabilized and like unbalanced some one one thing is for sure people don't want you to know who you are cuz if you know who you are they can't tell you who you are but but you know if you run into someone who's legitimately UT a utopian here we go get ready to lose [\\xa0__\\xa0] viewers right now baby this is where people press stop on Spotify go on to like listen to like my favorite murder or whatever but I was at Burning Man and stop stop stop stop stop hey man I am sure burning man is like everything else in the world there's a lot of profound conversations and few of them that want to make you just bury your head in the sand definitely and and and but one this guy came up to you just getting these great chats and this guy came up to me we're just yapping and he said do you think world peace is possible he wasn't being a missionary or anything just asking just asking it's a real question but it's so cliche that it seems like a joke question that a [\\xa0__\\xa0] would ask you isn't that funny like what would you want more than that world equality World Financial equality world peace there's like four or five things you would ever say like look that might cure up a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah that's right and but to ask it is so cliche like everybody Burning Man what well that's a that's we're peace well you know and that's other thing if like let's say you're at the Venice boardwalk and some son of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dressed like Uncle Sam comes and ask you that you're going to like go the other direction like [\\xa0__\\xa0] you like you're just GNA leave right maybe if you get out of Nicaragua man yeah yeah but but he was actually somebody who's really into Buckminster Fuller and I think that was something Buckminster Fuller put out there which is like this this question is very important and you should you should ask yourself this as an individual because if you think world peace is possible right uh even if you acknowledge that maybe right now it's not possible but if you can invent in your mind some technology some or even if you can invent in your mind like an X like an algebra for a thing you don't have the space for yet but it could be if there's any sense in you at all that world piece is possible then from that point forward you should be part of whatever it is that's going to make us have that great utopian ideal that transcends American borders and because the that's the other problem is the American dream thing it's confined It's Not The American Dream It's the human dream the human dream is the intuition we all have that there's a way for us to be on the planet together that doesn't involve blowing each other up right and that's I think it's possible I think it's possible I just don't know how it would be how to get there necessarily but I think it's possible and one thing's for sure whenever you get a trump or any [\\xa0__\\xa0] pundit blowing out divisive [\\xa0__\\xa0] into people's brains they are not draw if there's like a scale one Sid's World Peace one side's chaos they're dropping they're dropping their their Pebbles on the chaos part of the scale and it's like you why why do you think they're doing that cuz man let me tell you there's a lot of money to be made in [\\xa0__\\xa0] chaos man there's a lot of money I mean isn't that what an engine is an engine is kind of like controlled explosions do you remember when Trump talked openly once about the military-industrial comp complex yeah and he said they want to go to war yeah and you're like what the problem is he says so many other things that are ridiculous I know if only he just said that if only he just said that the problem with him saying that is you can go yeah yeah yeah but he also called this chicky [\\xa0__\\xa0] the horse face like you know he and you go oh yeah that's not that nice like he he had he had a he had a thing there like a moment like an isenhower moment not quite as eloquent but when Eisenhower was on television and he warned people about the military-industrial complex as he was leaving office that's to this day like one of the most profound speeches I've ever seen because it gives me a chill because I think well this is black and white from how many [\\xa0__\\xa0] years ago if this [\\xa0__\\xa0] was going on then it's not like it stopped going on didn't stop we see one of the reasons why we're in such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] up space politically is because this is the first time where politics have been really exposed to the General Public by the internet like you you have a different access to politics you never had before you have real time things breaking you find out like if someone like Gavin Newsome said he was going to take a pay cut he didn't Fox News princess it goes W and you get all these stories like oh would you have known that before cell phones and the internet you would have never known that he didn't do that you would have to be a person who's really into politics and there's not that many of them most people are busy so now politics relies on scandals and Scandals are weasel people through that's it so the thing about scandals is not everybody's a good person right and if you if you do a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] up [\\xa0__\\xa0] but you own it the way Trump did people didn't count on the [\\xa0__\\xa0] vote cuz there's a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] out there and finally they had a king they're like this is our King [\\xa0__\\xa0] you magga they wear the [\\xa0__\\xa0] sunglasses and they talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] to Ted Cruz at rallies those guys finally had a king and that that's like we didn't there was no King on the other side there was no King the compassionate intelligent King who actually made sense well that's the sad part that's what we don't have think how how depressing your very astute observation is in the sense that the idea was we weren't going to have a [\\xa0__\\xa0] monarchy here yeah that was the whole point and now we elect a monarchy yeah yeah that's the whole point man and it's like and again it's like look if like if you start playing the game that you're the smart person in the room and that if people disagree with you they must be dumb if people have ideas than you they must be stupid and then you start shaming them what can you what all you're doing is creating this like you're going to create a reaction to that and the reaction is going to be a celebration of every single thing you're with your great vast Elite intelligence to riding you know and so I think you know that's the problem is it's like I it's just there's nothing worse than when like people who are legitimately smart have read a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] books have got master's degrees have not developed enough compassion to understand that just about every single person on the planet wants to be happy wants to have a full stomach doesn't want to hurt anybody and would run into a building on fire to save somebody most everybody I would say I would say at least 90% a large percentage a large percentage and these [\\xa0__\\xa0] are are shaming them and telling them they're idiot or they're stupid or this and that it's like [\\xa0__\\xa0] you man you don't know what these people came up through you don't know these people were born into Like Houses filled with [\\xa0__\\xa0] methamphetamin smoke M whose parents were like you know absolutely [\\xa0__\\xa0] insane and they still managed to get out and get a job and have a [\\xa0__\\xa0] life and pay taxes and now your [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass is going to tell these people who didn't have the [\\xa0__\\xa0] trust fund that you had that got you into the [\\xa0__\\xa0] ivy league university they're [\\xa0__\\xa0] idiots shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up stop they're not and then I'm shaming those people that's the problem the idea is like you're not shaming them you're just honestly Illuminating their their their current situation let's just let I don't think it's shaming them yeah it's time to like let go of the whole like snoody thing it's time to also on the other side it's time to let go of like every single one of these people must be like burning candles to mik in their backyard thing too like let's let go of the all those stories for a second I'm not saying there aren't people burning candles to mik I've never definely are I've never met I've seen the Bohemian Grove video is that mik yes that's mik the owl God when Alex Jones and John Ronson's no it's Molech they they were talking about is it Molech is how youon Al Al according to Alex uh John Ronson and Alex Jones they snuck in Bohemian Grove this was when everybody was saying it was all [\\xa0__\\xa0] and I I say this many times and I'll say it some more give me that later you got it Fred Alex Jones he's he's made some mistakes and some big ones but he's also actually exposed some real [\\xa0__\\xa0] and he owns up to the mistakes he's made they're not good he doesn't think they're good the there's a thing about finding conspiracies everywhere that's not good for your brain I really believe this I think that if you go looking for those things and that's all you look for and you look for them all the time you can get real paranoid and real crazy and then there's also a bunch of people that are trying to stop you from doing that because you do expose some crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know he was talking about Epstein a long time ago I know a long time ago he was saying there was a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Island and and they take all these rich politicians and and some celebrities and they bang these kids and I was like come on he was telling me this a long time ago so he's also the one who told me about Bohemian Grove well I actually watched it from that's I think this tape was actually made before I met him so he went and snuck in to this place where like former president go there's a photograph of it's uh Ronald Reagan with Herbert Walker Bush and a couple other people all standing around and it's like these are the people that used to hang out at this place and they would put on robes and they would worship an hour God owl God and they would burn an effigy and they're playing and Alex snuck in and made video footage of this [\\xa0__\\xa0] and then no one's denying that it's real this really did happen they're so they're in with these bankers and former presidents and they're dressed like Druids and and some guy brings over something that it's an effigy that's supposed to be a body a wrapped up Effigy it's a bunch of sticks in BL in a blanket but it's like shaped like a body and they drop it on the fire and they're all worshiping an owl God why is that bad imagine if you saw those if that's what your business is just finding those things how crazy you think you get first of all wait then you add in vodka and head wounds wait wait wait hold on wait go to the Vodka headwinds part what do you Jones okay I got you lot of vodka he had a bad head injury God damn it man when I was in Liberal art school man there's this great teacher who changed my life Sam Scoville and he one of the things he taught was so beautiful he still teaches there one of the things he taught was figure out a way to take in all information and then filter out the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's not real and keep the real stuff and like you know Alex Jones is like let's yeah some of the stuff is real take what's real and throw there's a good chunk of it that's real like I remember he was telling me that that there's government's using chemicals to turn frogs gay I was like what what are you talking about he goes yes he goes pesticides are turning frogs gay and I'm like that can't be real no there really is is that true yes there's pesticides that change Frog's genders what yes yes but some pesticide [\\xa0__\\xa0] with Frog's genders that sucks maybe it doesn't I mean depends on the Frog maybe it's awesome for the FR maybe frog don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] cuz they've never been taught homophobia they don't care who they [\\xa0__\\xa0] but there's a real thing that see you find that it's it's a pesticide that has some sort of an effect an unintended effect on frogs genders dude that's another thing that people don't talk about pesticides that have been used in like golf courses and like there's people who live around those that's a chemical dump yeah golf courses are F pesticide atrazine can turn male frogs into females cool so there's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] pesticide that changes the gender or should I say the sex is it the same thing I have to sex and gender hey I'm not getting sucked into that [\\xa0__\\xa0] black hole Rogan you can keep that [\\xa0__\\xa0] to yourself but hey I'll get sucked into another black hole isn't that crazy though well yeah before we get into the that that stuff I want to say this real quick okay is that camera on me friends at the Bohemian Grove future friends I should say I just want you to know I don't know much about you I I know Alex Jones you know probably on vodka drinks I don't think he was then I think he was sober he started drinking after all this please don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] this up for me sorry sorry so you had an infiltrator look I went to a summer camp we have bonfires we wore robes I mean not like maybe what you do I just want to say hey come on invite me please I won't tell anybody anything I've heard you guys are pretty awesome actually what I've heard is the idea was to get a bunch of Hardcore neocons together and then mix some artist in in the hopes that like having like brushing shoulders with artists would in some way shape or form loosen some people up a little bit and I've also heard you have a tram that connects campsites there to other campsites meaning you just get in the tram and suddenly you're hanging out with Dick Cheney listen I won't tell anybody I got a podcast I won't even tell Joe let me in I'll worship mik I won't worship mik if it means hurting people but I don't understand why people are upset about [\\xa0__\\xa0] by the way they that you [\\xa0__\\xa0] video why is what's wrong with worshiping nothing this is the so excited this is the thing that I get confused about here it's like in our country we've got people who are Christian yes and that's beautiful thing and I do love Jesus I was reading the book of Mark today regarding the parable of the S but that being said I don't think it's fair necessarily to tell people they can't worship an owl or burn an effigy in front of an owl and some kind of symbolic magical ritual that represents the disintegration of your negative energy or whatever it may be I really don't know but that be you know to me that's the other problem that's happening right now is like Superstition is R running rampant I'm friends with lots of witches I know a few satanists and I know a few people are under the occult and I don't know a single one of them that would tolerate child abuse I don't know a single one that wouldn't kill somebody some of them would kill people if they thought they were hurting kids not and make it so that nobody found the body some of the Satanist know they would kill some they would kill someone probably I don't know for sure I'm not trying to throw any Satanist under the bus but I'm just saying like this idea that we can't have alter alternate Pagan religions in our country without immediately being associated with human sacrifice or child abuse I think that goes against the American Spirit it's like look because people don't want to subscribe to your particular like very popular Global religion doesn't necessarily implicate them in like something that is truly a horror which is human trafficking so to me this is the problem is like man we got to be a little bit more nuanced in our apprehend in our conceptualization of these people again I don't know what's going on at the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Bohemian Grove but from what I've heard it's basically a summer camp for billionaires where they try to get artists in there to like loosen them up a little bit that's what I've heard I could be wrong who told you this is this I honestly can't [\\xa0__\\xa0] say h h interesting look man I don't know and I know and I've seen have you seen the video of Bohemian Grove have you seen it the the the the ritual in front of the AL God have you seen it yeah dude go come with me to Burning Man and you will see that every every 50 feet sure look I don't think it's that big of a deal I really don't if it involves hurting kids it's a big deal and if these [\\xa0__\\xa0] are doing anything that involves Human Sacrifice hurting human beings in in in a in any application of that of course then it's the worst thing on Earth and I'm so sorry that I said anything about it but I don't think I don't think that's what this is I mean obviously what we're seeing is not that we don't know what else happens but what you're seeing is them burning sticks in front of this uh owl God and it's like this crazy um crazy uh Speech they're giv while it's going on it's it's really weird hey can we hear some of it the speech I don't know where the speech is in the video I found another video where they like stabilize the footage the oh it's like uh but I mean before before this nobody really believed that listen care and all the winds make carry with th docks hail fellowship's Eternal Flame once again Midsummer sets us free and now they're they're lighting the effigy on fire and everybody's cheering it looks fun Stanley cubrick had this uh quote once to uh Nicole Kidman I think it was they were working on Eyes Wide Shut see if you can find what she said about the elites that he that he had said say I I know I saved it I can find it if I have chance to look at my laptop but it was something about him you know talking about the the powers that run the world and that they all have something on each other that's how they all can stay together they all compromise each other that's what Skull and Bones was about like that's what all that stuff is about so he had a much more concise quote on that but when you see something like that you go well maybe it's like fun that they do it that nobody knows they do it you know what I'm saying yeah like maybe it's like one of those rituals where you get together your dad thinks it's hilarious and you both put your hoods on you go out there and you burn the owl or you burn the sticks in front of the owl and what's fun is that you're not supposed to be doing it and it's a secret but nothing really is happening that's also on the table yeah it's possible but it it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] weird man that was weird imagine if there was no Catholic Church imagine if you are a billionaire that's what you're doing with your weekend but imagine if there was no Catholic church and there was one video of a mass right we would be like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up imagine any religious ceremony if there was only one version of it cuz I I I'm not trying to reduce it to summer camp fun or even like fraternity games there's a who knows what it is right we we just you can know what it is yeah they'd have to tell us but we just see something crazy but it's not evil I mean what is it well it's for me it's a question mark I I don't really know I know that my just dress weird my my tendency whenever I have a question mark is to assign malevolence to it just out of a basic kind of weakness in my own bias like if I don't know what a thing is like you know when you're waiting for the doctor to call regarding some Scan they just did on you you you know if you if you have the slightest fear of death or any kind of bias in you then that space in between when you when maybe we're overlooking this maybe it's like their version of Renaissance Fair and people just want to escape reality and pretend that they live with mik the hour God and throw a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Hood over your head and yes please and peace be with you yeah I mean it it could be some kind of like Pagan celebration you know and if you look back at like the history of paganism or Hedonism or Terence McKenna does such a great job talking about the elu cidian Mysteries and the you know all these like things that aren't really quite as accessible as the main main religions of the world all the religions of the world they have this beautiful quality in them depending on the religion and generally one of the qualities is so beautiful is a mechanism of self forgiveness and a mechanism of purification the a general assessment of the human condition as being somewhat depraved I how many like the puking in iasa you're purging yourself from your Darkness the confession booth in Catholicism uh maybe you could say in gnosticism like true nosis or in Buddhism like connecting with like actual reality versus your overlayed reality or you know it goes on and on this is all within each one is this idea of like there's a way for us to ritualistically uh create if you want to be a pure scientific materialist a beautiful placebo effect that gets you to drop some of your neurotic qualities or the very least reset your intention to make the world a better place and anything whatever that I don't care what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] it is whatever it may be if that's what it what it's all about is a recognition like man you beat yourself up every day you're so hard on yourself you beat yourself up for all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you did in the past and and and we live in a world right now where there's not much tolerance there's not much forgiveness and and and anything that allows a a kind of like steam valve from which all that [\\xa0__\\xa0] can get released so from this day forward you're born again you're brand new I don't care if it's an owl man go if you think that's crazy look at like Main Street Disneyland any night that's some crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] to watch too and some people's entire lives I'm not being like changed from like having a great night anywhere so you know to me it's like ritual is not scary to me what's scary to me though I is uh any that objectifies humans enslaves humans uh uh hurts kids and so yeah Human Sacrifice any of that stuff and if that's what's really happening there I truly don't know then I completely apologize for any defense sticks it's just sticks the question is was it always just sticks did it used to be people did they used to sacrifice a person did they stop doing it at one point in time one widely cited Nicole Kidman interview was made up by the fake news site news punch you sons of [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] God damn it they got me they got you but again does it say what the quote is yeah what is the quote he said the Hollywood's run by pedophiles or something like I found the Reddit page where it was put up and God damn they got me they glad I asked you hey you want to see something real creepy can Jamie may I ask you to look something up look up the that there's a a video of a van that was actually used for human trafficking I saw that that [\\xa0__\\xa0] is chilling terrify chilling and it's like to me it's like man if we're gonna be it is there anybody who is at the Helm of the ship that's fighting those [\\xa0__\\xa0] right now deserves medals and I hope that they never stop what they're doing I just want them to be very precise in their attacks that's all don't dilute your position by getting caught up in something and again I am not I'm already going to get attacked for this saying like Doug it works for the blah blah I don't I I don't I'm a Buddhist and I I go to romdas Retreats and burning man but and if they invited me to the Bohemian Grove I go and if I went there and I saw that I was going to say if Stanley cuber can keep keep a secret we can too are you saying you would go to the Grove with me yes that' be awesome tell anybody but you know if you and I were invited there and we saw anything happening that was anything to do with like what people I would think it would be a trap and they would be setting us up they would put on like some sort of fake thing just to make us look like fools that we talk about it on our podcast do you know man if we ever do a movie together that's the movie like it should be all your friends going to the bo get invited to the Bohemian group exactly right like I become friends with some guy who's like a banker who really likes comedy yeah right and then this guy tells you he gets drunk one night like I I know the Illuminati they're real the Bilderberg Group it's real like what yeah man Jackal Island it's a they made the federal Institute it's not even from America man and you're like what what and then this guy starts un unraveling the tale of America can I tell you something crazy the Federal Reserve yeah people in my family used to own parts of Jackal Island okay tell the story of Jackal Island cuz that's what I'm talking about if people don't know it well here's the problem I don't know the story like I I I remember hearing some [\\xa0__\\xa0] I have like two paragraphs in my head memorized I remember hearing people in my family had some claim on land there and that they sold it and I since then I was just kind of resentful because it's like they sold it for nothing and like if they'd held on to it like you know I would be at the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Bohemian Grove and so Jackal Island supposed to be the place where they invented the Federal Reserve right I I went there's a great hotel is that it Jamie what does it say listen this all disclaimer figure where to look we're all three of us are morons yes okay this is not that's one thing that drives me crazy there's one of the things about silencing people that are crazy online I can tell when someone's crazy and part of someone being crazy is you see these crazy people and you go oh I think they might be crazy and then you look in you go yeah none of none of what they're saying makes sense they actually are crazy but damn that was pretty close yeah dude you got to be the thing about people saying things that other people disagree with when they want to silence those people is you don't think that other people are smart as you you're thinking that's going to work on other people someone's saying that the Earth is flat and there's lizard people that control the sunrise if that was you you'd go okay you know what I'm saying it wouldn't work so why not let someone say it so if someone says it it doesn't work on you but what are you worried about you're worried it's going to work on somebody else that's what you're worried about you worri it's going to and that's the weird thing about Co because it's the one thing where you're not allowed to do that anymore because if you do anything that goes against the government by lines anything that goes against what the World Health Organization thinks you should do or CDC thinks you should do you get kicked off of YouTube you get silenced everybody gets removed whether you're right or wrong it's the one thing where you can't talk crazy you can talk crazy about the Earth being hollow you can talk about being that are made out of light that fly in and out of our Consciousness and that's responsible for all of our ideas and you could talk about how there's an application that's coming in 2023 it's right now being vetted by the NSA to make sure that we can use it so we can communicate with the aliens you can have all these whacko videos where you're making [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and no one cares but if you say that masks don't help and what we need to do is uh get healthier they'll remove you from YouTube well that's the fire and a crowded theater thing like you can't yell fire in a crowded theater so so like the pro like look the problem with it is to me is I like have like gone through every single stage of grief over YouTube is a bad um analogy maybe a better analogy is you can open up businesses as long as you do it carefully I Used to Love YouTube man I used to love it I still love it well what I loved about it in the old days I still love it I still go on every day but what I loved about in the old days is what you're saying no one's putting a cork in the champagne bottles it wild it was it was a museum of Madness and you would and what was even better as the algorithm was working in your favor so it's like punch in Hollow Earth yes that's going to take you all the way to like some crazy deep [\\xa0__\\xa0] and never once in all my Explorations on on the early days of YouTube was I like this could be real it was more like wow look at how all the different versions of reality that people are processing and and it was a joy but I think what happened probably is like people realize like God like what we've got like you talk about this ties bad the nightmare when and it will happen when primates figure how to like use friction to make fire you talk about this yes and that's a nightmare for the planet like you think the [\\xa0__\\xa0] shit's bad now wait till the chimps figure out guns yeah just fire just fire just figure out how to make their own fire think think of like the beginning the when like if the Proto homed shift into like figure out really good point you know this is trouble imagine think of how many people died in the beginning of like discovering fire oh my God how many experiments were done with fire how many things were just set on fire how many people just burn I can eat it I bet you can eat it let me eat it I'll get its energy in my body holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] he melted his face off you know so similarly like with with the internet we have this F we have this new fire and like people who are like in the conduits of the fire are are are I think they're they're having this really rotten come to Jesus moment where they're like cuz I think a lot of these especially if you look in the Silicon Valley these people are freaks the early day like the people making technology they're nuts I seen you that Steve Jobs thing with him in a commune or whatever these people are [\\xa0__\\xa0] crazy but I think they're recognizing that like it it's like okay the internet is the new Fire yeah and and and so and they're starting to understand that like because of them because of their intentional manipulative Cod voting because of their deep study of BF Skinner and behaviorism they've produced this hypers seductive semi sentient information dispersal device that is driving people who don't have the immune system to data that you're supposed to naturally get from school crazy that's what's happening and so people are going nuts because it's like well add that with the addictive quality of Technology those two things together The Addictive quality just looking at like your phone and getting information off your phone and then add it to all this stuff that you're saying yeah man and and it's a crazy combination and there I think Google and YouTube and as much as like you know and I do think censorship's [\\xa0__\\xa0] I would hate to be in anybody's position there because on one hand you're looking at like a very liberal very beautiful idea which is like everyone should be allowed to say whatever they want to say and then it's meeting like well but what about these hyper charismatic seductive people who like Hitler you know what I mean like so now you run into this terrible place of like and also we know that there's people who don't quite have the ability to discern what's real from what's not but we allow this is my beef we allow some of that because we allow evangelists I heard Robert Tien on one of his shows yeah he goes every time you write a check to me Satan gets a black eye good dude it was in my act for a while I was like where's my checkbook you Satan you son of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude it's imagine you could steal money that way it's look man I I don't but you know what I'm saying yeah I do know exactly what you're saying and it's like this type of con Artistry also cigarettes oh you know it's like this type of con Artistry generally it seems like there's some kind of Grandfather claws on specific styles of of of thievery and murder yeah yeah cuz cigarettes like they know they're killing people imagine if you had bubble gum that killed a half a million people a year just bubble it's like bubble gum but just people just dying stop selling that [\\xa0__\\xa0] what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are you doing what are you doing you're see well people have a right to chew their bubble gum a lot of people like bubbles yeah that's right that's all it was it's like you chewing bubbles makes you happy and everybody's dying of cancer and this company's making $500 billion dollar a year something like how much do they make on cigarettes yeah how much let's let's guess let's guess what do you how much what do you think the an by the way I want to say it before this is a box of cigars okay Mike binder gave me that and he gave me that one over there another box of cigars I'm not anti-tobacco in any way shape or form I'm a pro- free choice person you absolutely should be able to smoke cigarettes and I think you absolutely should be able to sell them because I don't want to roll my own and if I want a cigarette as a grown [\\xa0__\\xa0] man you can I want to be able to have a cigarette but cigarettes do kill a half a million people in this country every year yeah or they're going to die anyway right cigarettes kill them early or they die directly because of diseases that you can get from smoking cigarettes and their kids get sick dude the worst Man kids that live in Greg fit Simmons he has lung problems to this day because his parents chain smoked and they lived in massachus cold my mom did but she quit when I was really young did when I was like six I were you in the car with her when she smoked I I must have been with the windows up I don't well we lived in New Jersey so it cold in the winter I'm sure I was I don't think she smoked in the car with her kids though dude do you mind if I have a little more of this [\\xa0__\\xa0] have a drink at all man it's so good uh I I remember Fletcher North Carolina middle of winter you'd go down and wait for the bus my friend Jimmy Fink I think it was Jimmy Fink his mom would like let us get in her car to wait for the bus it's wonderful very sweet but also I think and I'm sorry Jimmy if you're out there I know we haven't talked in a long time I still love you though but like and I'm sorry if it's not you and I'm getting confused here but the I just remember she smoked and we like there was smoke in the car my dad smoked I would ride in the car with him on trips and he would smoke and you'd breathe in the smoke and like so so to me like where and again like this is always the problem which is like clearly we need regul there has to be some regulatory principle in the world if there are people who steal watches there mean that means there's going to be groups of people who get together and talk about better ways to steal watches if there's groups of people get together talk about better ways to steal watches and then we create a way for them to form a thing called like a corporation you know what I mean you got you need to regulate that that's why we need regulation so but then the problem is is like who does the regulating and what what's the incentive for you to regulate is there a financial incentive yeah The Regulators get paid an exorbitant amount of money let's say you and I start a vape pen company that like is a nicotine vape pen and then start pouring money into people who against tobacco knowing if we can make tobacco illegal but keep the vape pens legal we're going to become the new tobacco but here's the thing about vape pens this is the real thing about VAP pens some of them are not good for you at all they're real bad for you and there's a connection there're saying now between covid and uh kids that Vape kids that Vape dying of Co or getting serious covid but it makes sense I have a friend who's got a kid that sucks on one of them things things all day long just just Vapes constantly kids vape and these kids that Vape all the time like the oils that you're taking into your lungs That's not healthy the idea that it's not cigarettes so it's healthy no it's there's a lot of evidence that points to some of those companies that make those oils they don't do it in a way where you know there's like different kinds of oils and they have the different reactions to the Heat and some of them are like am I saying this right let's check on this what is the problem with the different types of Vapes because I think there was one type of oil that they're using you because they have to they have to somehow or another mix the same with the marijuana ones you have to mix this stuff with the THC and it's some sort of chemical but there's different you can do it organically like I know they've done it with um uh coconut oil I know they've done it with like things like that it's the same way with hash man I think it's like the the way people make hash varies and some people there's a healthy way to make it and the obviously the way using the most chemicals is the cheapest and so there's certain types of hash that you I think are derive and again my friends out there look I don't know but it's something like butane someone told me this at a at a marijuana store I can't remember what but yeah man it's like concern is the oil like what kind of oil like I know there's one guy that was selling them the with MCT oil okay here it is authorities in the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and preven ition still aren't sure what's causing the dangerous Trend but theories range from issues with vegetable oil and vape juice to the idea that doctors are just now taking note of a problem that's been percolating for a long time so okay so that was a speculation that people were using um like if you try to cook okay and you try to like sear a steak and you do it with olive oil you're going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] it up because olive oil is it's not like something that you really um sear something with like you put olive oil in you don't you don't want to get it that hot yeah olive oil is more something that you'd like to sauté with but other oils like avocado oil or um or beef fat like that stuff is amazing because you can get it really [\\xa0__\\xa0] hot and it has a very very high uh temperature where it turns to smoke right so it's like healthier for you the idea so if you're misting this stuff into your lungs you don't want it burnt right right you want something that's more so I would imagine if you're using these cheap this is again I'm a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I'm not a scientist but we're doing science if you're using a vape Vape pen with like some really shitty canola oil and you're getting that burnt spray inside your lungs like that could be terrible for you terrible you got some [\\xa0__\\xa0] GMO cornn syrup [\\xa0__\\xa0] in your lungs yeah you know the haunting thing man you go to a pharmacy right and you watch as the pharmacist dispenses the drugs how careful he is right like they are like so careful in their administration of these pills because they know if like for one second you give someone Xanax when they were supposed to get penicillin killed somebody right so you have to be very careful but like meanwhile look at us right now Joe did you do a test on that bottle of booze are these I didn't even I honestly it was embarrassing I'm like I don't know how to light this blunt but then like I'm smoking something called dadrass I don't know what's in this [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't do any studies here I just that's for people who love Steely Dan I I do love Steely Dan do too they have some great [\\xa0__\\xa0] songs you know what I mean I'm saying like the general like in in America and anywhere The General sense is I'm going to eat it if you give it to me especially if it's in a colorful box and then you're like it must be okay and and the problem is is like sometimes it's not okay look at thalomid man like you know look at like the big moments in history when it was shown like actually sometimes the stuff we sell you is that theide theide that's the stuff that gave kids birth def facts yeah or what was that radioactive [\\xa0__\\xa0] they painted on watches oh my god dude we did a whole show where talked about all the diseases that people got from idium was that what it was Jamie what was the radium radium idium the they were using it for all kinds of things and people's faces were rotting off yeah literally they have holes in their face they were painting it on watches cuz it it would glow it was cool looking but so so similarly it's like they were using it for makeup I think right yeah and here we have the internet here we have the [\\xa0__\\xa0] internet suddenly we have a hyper a way to like super connect with every single person on the planet but not just connect with every person on the planet we have an artificial intelligence based on a neural network I don't understand how it works suggesting who you should connect with you know what I mean it's like is the internet the thalidomide technological thalidomide are we looking at a I think so is that what we were dealing with right now and like I think we're on a spaceship and we haven't quite figured out how to slow it down or where the brakes are or how do you go left or right yeah but the spaceship is being propelled by thoughts and ideas and social media and world events and drugs and sex and politics and power and control and it's all just hurling through space and while while it's all happened we haven't quite figured out where the breaks are or what's the best way to be harmonious with each other so we're all in this constant battle for control thinking that once we get in control we're going to set this [\\xa0__\\xa0] ship straight and everybody's going to be cool we're going to be finally we're going to get along because you're side one but you're still going to have half the [\\xa0__\\xa0] country that hates you half the country that doesn't agree with you half the country that has to like be really tolerant in order to engage you in any of your ideas and admit that you're right right yeah and this is what we're doing and it's not real it's not real I don't think it's real I think a lot of the people that have ideas in one way if they could just talk to people in in in in the realm of the area where they have disagreement I bet they could work it out I think the problem is more people not talking than anything Joe tell me about the spaceship idea some more cuz I don't think you're saying some like knowing you like I know you I wonder if you're saying that metaphorically or like if there's it is metaphorically but it's also actual we are on a spaceship whether we like it or not we're spinning a thousand miles an hour and we're driving through Infinity at a pace that if you if it was small and it passed by you you would go holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah what was it if it was if the Earth was the size of a baseball and it whipped by you in real time the way it's moving through the universe you would be like [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's what the Earth's doing but the Earth is huge yeah it's huge and yet it's tiny and it's surrounded by things that are enormous got a sun that's a million times bigger than us just a fireball in the sky that all life on Earth depends on a very clear space between Earth and the Sun a perfect balance perfect balance between this Unstoppable heat and just keep the water melted don't boil it man and we're hurling through infinity and while we're doing that we're trying to pick who gets to be the leader to steal your tax money we're trying to tell you you can't go to a beauty shop CU I don't want you get in a cough that's right we're trying to tell people stay home stay home Trump's trying to kill America y it's the wrong approach like the approach they're making the the approach they should make it should be all about positivity you know everybody who's voting knows who Trump is everybody knows about the riots everybody knows about everybody knows all those things talk about what you want to do yeah talk about what you want to do don't talk about how bad the orange guy is tell me what you want to do and don't use woke lingo don't you [\\xa0__\\xa0] do it don't you do it tell me tell me for real don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] me tell me what you can do to fix this right just that tell me you want to bring everybody together just that everybody rightwing left you got to make concessions we got to figure out like where we meet in the middle there's much more that we agree with than we don't agree much more let's concentrate on that stuff and let's be nice about this other [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah that's right that's it that's look it sound like you know what you're saying it it's beautiful and the what's one of the qualities that's beautiful about is is simple that I when I saw I got to see the dolly llama speak once and it's like wow you in person no at a at a he was at a like an event right but you were in the audience yeah I was in the audience so he was there he was there with his translator it was beautiful man real like the vibe in the in the room was so sweet and like you know to go back to what we were talking about earlier some people will tell you a stupid thing like a thing on the side of a cal box like uh I apologize for that be kinder for oh I'm so sorry but you know I could tell you Joe you know what the world needs love and it's I do like cliches though sometimes sometimes they're accurate depend on who it's coming who the cliche is coming from right if they're sincere so the doy Lama is on stage and he says you can always be kinder and it was like you could feel this wave rushing out of him I mean it was like the essence of Buddhism just rushing out everyone simultaneously thinking like yeah he's right and it transcends politics geopolitics and and that that is why what you're saying is so beautiful because it's the same thing which is like you know like this planet we're so lucky to be on a planet going that fast and and and and like we're so lucky to to get a chance a little peephole into time we're not here that long I think this Co thing gives us an opportunity to realize how lucky we really are I do too I do for the people that are struggling right now financially or struggling with their health it doesn't you know doesn't register with you I'm and I'm sorry about that but I think for the people that aren't [\\xa0__\\xa0] by this there is a moment where we get to realize like oh okay we were uh taking this for granted we thought we had all this thing wired in we didn't have it wired I mean they got rid of the Senate what what was the the pandemic there was a pan the White House decided like a year before Corona decided to get rid of the pandemic what was a response what was the actual no like he got the whole based on it they they they dissolved it just imagine imagine if like there's an asteroid like well when's it coming 40 years fire everybody fire everyone we're [\\xa0__\\xa0] we're [\\xa0__\\xa0] just fire everybody the more tests the more sick people we have stop the test just Fu they did that for real know I know I know they so so from that what did they teach us they taught us that we have to depend on each other right now not the state well I think they should give people the opportunity to do what they want to do I really I say this too much I say it at almost every show but you can't tell people they can't work it doesn't make any sense you should you're not smart enough for you to say that you that the only thing that matters is whether or not these people expose themselves to the virus at this point I think that's ridiculous but can I tell you the problem I'm sorry I'm sorry to cut you off but they have to acknowledge that something else matters they have to acknowledge that the financial problems that people are going through are almost unsurmountable they have to acknowledge that and that that destroys a lot of people that creates a lot of depression creates a lot of suicide creates a lot of drug abuse creates a lot of turmoil and a lot of mental health issues that's a fact true so we we're we're taking away people's sovereignty look man if you want to that was another great American tradition if you want to kill yourself well you can do it with so many other ways you're welcome to kill yourself go BMX flipping nobody's going to stop you from doing flips with your motorbike that was the whole point I mean that's like remember when everything got safe like the whole point there was a time when everything was like Al Gonzo and the problem is you're spreading it right so it's not just you and your motorbike it's you crashing your motorbike into a crowd that that's one of the problems there's a lot of that's a good way of looking at it honestly yeah but the bigger to me the bigger that is a problem and it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] the bigger problem is okay so you own an Applebees or whatever right and suddenly the government's like okay everyone can go back to work but no one solve the problem you the owner of the Applebee's calls the the general manager like hey dude get the waiters weight staff back we're open it up you're not going to be there you're going to have the general manager come in and you're going to have the weight staff come in now the weight staff have been living off of unemployment benefits supplied by the federal government that sometimes are more than like what they were making at the place that's not a bad thing but all of a sudden what happened is prior to a true reduction of this pandemic that can kill you most of the time it doesn't but you might be the one who steps in the landmine all of a sudden they just decided Well we got the the economy needs to work so now your unemployment benefits get cut off and you have to go back to work but they haven't solved the problem yet so you become the the the person who has to Bear the weight of the failed uh approach to the disease and that's why it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up to s yes you're right man my friend runs the new California Barber Shop in Echo Park Brian he's one of my be he started off as my barber he became my best friend he's one of the the coolest people I know and like I like it like one of the reasons I want to leave La is cuz that shop can't open that's where I used to go to get my beard trimmed in my ha but it wasn't just that it was it's a real barber shop and it was you have these great conversations you beat people he like he's like gotten me like he's gotten me into a sublet that I once when I needed to be in La for a little bit one of the sad things about being bald I never really developed the relationship with the barber shop and by the time I shaved it my head it was too late that's a good thing to do you can get like a nice straight razor shape yeah you know there's you don't go to a bar something about that right it's like for girl with girls it's acknowledged that a lot of ladies like beauty salons they like to get their nails done they like to get their pedicures they enjoy it yeah I really like yeah like that's all been shut down here right right and like it sucks because that that I I loved going there and it's like but you know the the the thing is like a lot of people it's not time to go back to work because if there is a true risk that from making minimum wage you're going to get a disease that probably won't kill you cuz you're a waiter Applebee's you're probably going to be okay you're taking your vitamins but you might be living with your aunt who has Alzheimer's disease and you're going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] kill her because you picked up a little bit of it and the reason you're going to kill her is because you had to go back to work because your benefits got cut off so it's like this is the this is why it's a very complex [\\xa0__\\xa0] up problem that really we we it's like yes do for me a person who I'm doing great do I I want everything open I want to go to guitar guitar center is open but I don't want to stand in line I want to go into guitar I want everything to be the way it was I'm probably going to be okay but this is again it's like this is a complex problem I don't buy into the idea that the whole thing's a scam I think we've got exactly what that [\\xa0__\\xa0] not why did I say [\\xa0__\\xa0] too much boo that a do he was actually the opposite of an [\\xa0__\\xa0] on your show I'm like calling a doctor an [\\xa0__\\xa0] Remember The Joe Rogan questions everything the theologist who told us there's going to be another great pandemic six years well we should I've talked about this before but we should tell people Duncan and I were in Galveston Texas and we went to the Center for Disease Control and went to the very place where they experiment on Ebola and all these crazy diseases that kill you instantly and Duncan and I were in this building and we were watching like we watch through a window that takes you there's like another window behind that that's like this plexiglass sealed room and they have like space suits on and tubes and I'm like hold on hold on so there's some [\\xa0__\\xa0] in there that can kill everybody like 100% And like it's right there and they were doing tests on it and so these people are wearing like space suits and they're walking around with these horrific World killing diseases yeah man and remember we missed the flight yeah we did we missed the flight we had to get there we were just high as [\\xa0__\\xa0] at the airport talking and the flight the flight took off dunan and I lost total track of time we were barbecued we did we take edibles dude I don't remember we did something we were so high we might have took Ed we might have took my my custom is to take an edible in the car my custom that's because it takes time to get to the airport and by the time you get to the airport the absurdity of it all just kicks in in Full Steam cuz it's like I have no control at the airport the airport is a place where you just want to give up complete control and when you're super duper duper High that's a fun ride you know so you and I were just sitting down talking about life and that plane went we're like where's the plane like the plane left like what we didn't just miss the plane by like 10 minutes like 40 minutes it was the ultimate dumb Stoner Moment Like if we weren't on our way to film a television show we would have looked like the biggest losers we looked like losers anyway but but we had fun and we took one in the morning and we got there with very little sleep we made it but being in like the Galveston Texas Centers for Disease Control with like very this is different this is the um this is dunan this is Duncan went to some Preppers this is one that I really Lov cuz I didn't get a chance to be with you so I got to watch it you know like from the clips and see what it was like when you went didn't you get to be that one I was doing something else we were trying to film two things at the same time I think that time you know what man I was really like not annoyed but like because I love doing the show but I'm like of course he doesn't show up to this [\\xa0__\\xa0] cuz like suddenly I end up deep in a I'm deep in a cave would have totally done it but I think it was when like there was a bunch of things that we were trying to film and we were short on time so we couldn't do things together but remember we did this Skinwalker Ranch one together you were so pissed he was so fake oh there was the problem was when we got there right when we got there we heard this Preposterous story from this person who threw a cigarette on the ground after that's what set you off 100% yeah cuz I'm like this is a [\\xa0__\\xa0] he threw a cigarette on the ground in the forest this is a [\\xa0__\\xa0] like we drove here for and he's lying we we're here with a [\\xa0__\\xa0] who's lying I'm like oh great great I actually asked him to pick it up I'm like come on man I remember that moment dude and it but that to me it's like you can't it's beautiful Utah Forest you smoke a cigarette and you throw it down you step on it like you're not my kind of person Joe here's the reason you're so American you really do believe in a utopian ideal and Joe Rogan questions everything for real both of us this is what I realized ye years after we both had a sense in our heart that we might really find proof of something big and we went into it with that attitude we did but we were so high we believe what we were saying dude that's the funniest thing about it it's like you know most people when they do these shows they're not going into it thinking like I'm actually going to uncover something yeah of course they don't go into it thinking they're going to un cover something they go into it thinking this is all a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] and I'm going to do so I'm going to be like or maybe they think maybe it's real or whatever but the main thing is they they don't they talk they they pretend it's real that's the thing they it's real T it's real and we also went into it like two guys who are more High during a show you will not find yeah it's true you will not find theti let me barbecued looking for bigfoot I mean dude I was barbecu we were so high dude and this guy we don't need to blow this guy's spot up he's poor fell look at me my hipst are face oh boy listen people love maybe he believes what he's saying maybe maybe all that stuff that they were telling us they really truly believe but they were talking about like bulletproof wolves that appear out of mist and all this stuff to me that moment was when the show went South and what was really funny was like this the last thing the Sci-Fi Network wanted was for you to like actually like begin to like realize that maybe we're not going to find UFOs and they started getting unhappy I think with the situation oh they did get unhappy there was actually a conversation when they're like is he trying to debunk these things cuz they have all these shows on like UFOs and all these show on ghosts and then they have this comedian [\\xa0__\\xa0] with his [\\xa0__\\xa0] buddy and they're both high as [\\xa0__\\xa0] and they're like this is so fake like this is so but we wanted to know we wanted to know we wanted to know if it was real or if it was fake remember the alien artifacts part do you remember that part there was someone who collected all these alien little bits of dust and metal you don't remember it probably I remember that because I was already given up on that point I noticed a p unfortunately and I feel real bad but it was it was really a personal thing because I was dealing with my own nonsense my own incv my own inclination to uh believe ridiculous stories even today like with the Pentagon story about them having recovered uh a craft not made from this world like please don't let it be a misquote I don't want to I don't want to read the misquote man I don't so I know that there's a real pull to believing in [\\xa0__\\xa0] there's a real pull to like manipulating the actual facts of Roswell so that it appears the government absolutely 100% colluded to keep the alien crash from the general public and there's no way it could be a weather balloon I don't know if that's right man because I know it in myself because I see it in myself I see that dirty little [\\xa0__\\xa0] that wants to believe in Bigfoot that stupid [\\xa0__\\xa0] they're like hey hey hey maybe it's a bear maybe it's not a lost monkey species but I want to believe so bad so I don't think that's a dirty [\\xa0__\\xa0] but this is me this is me I've worked on this right this is something that I've spent a lot of time thinking about there's a lot of people out there that just lie they're not thinking about anything but they the same way they want to believe too they want to believe in UFOs they want to believe in Bigfoot they want to believe in all these things they want to believe yeah and it's not their fault they this is they grew up in a [\\xa0__\\xa0] up town and their their friends were probably all drunk by the time they were four and the whole thing's a mess and here they are stuck in this situation where they're just making [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and here you and I are standing there going I don't think this guy ever really was kidnapped by Bigfoot and we we get to hear these ridiculous stories and there was too many of them man we everybody we talked to had this I I like real obvious psychological like Bend to them there was always like everyone and no one had a steady chassis no one who you were talking to right yes remember the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Bigfoot guy that said he would chop his pinky off to find out if Bigfoot was real he was a professor he was a professor I forget we had him on the podcast we we had the foot the footprint seeing Dr M Dr meler right M Meldrum yes thank you Jamie's the wizard Dr Meldrum Dr Meldrum he said he would cut his finger off to find out if Bigfoot was real would you cut your finger off to find no I don't care listen I hope it's not real I hope it's it's real I don't care either one would be awesome what data set would you cut your finger off I would cut my finger off to know if there was a a intelligent design to Creation on Earth I would give them my the very tip of my pinky for that but then what happens then you run around with this information you can't share with anybody and you're freaked out all day well no then I try to contact that thing in a more intense way I mean like the the P the tip of the pink is not a bad thing to get rid of yeah for like knowing knowing like whether there's like again you have to like so weak first of all what what kind of computer are you working with that you're going to have to take your pinky and like drop it in to get truth out of it it's a stupid computer you shouldn't trust it if you ever want to feel what it's like to to be like three again make your thumb wrestle your pinky your pinky is like [\\xa0__\\xa0] you have no power in your pinky your pinky is so weak that's what it's like to be like a three-year-old straining against your older brother get off me get off me [\\xa0__\\xa0] you got a pinky that's right this a what a [\\xa0__\\xa0] little digit what does that thing get used for just what does it get used for again I dislocated both of them you dislocated them you're pinky they don't match up oh dude oh damn oh that's weird so one oh B oh that makes s and all sorts of sh you use it for holding wine you need it to like extend when you're drinking yes look man very important I think that out don't you like I heard my pinky doing that wrestling with my thumb like legitimately it hurts now it's so weak it's so weak I but I do so much with my hands so many chinups there's some reason for it so many kettle bell grips and it's mostly these other fingers even when you draw back a a bow my bow my uh my release doesn't even have a pinky thing I draw back with these fingers this [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass just hangs around for the ride you're so mean to your pinky why do you do that I love my pinkies I love them they're great I don't want them miss them but think of the name itself it's like it's weird how weak it is compared to all the other digits you have and they named it a pinky like the whole thing is like mess the whole thing does sound like it's it is a a very like we the name pinky itself is like you know I will [\\xa0__\\xa0] you up with this finger this finger right here is strong as [\\xa0__\\xa0] this finger gets a hold of [\\xa0__\\xa0] this is a strong finger this is a [\\xa0__\\xa0] finger that's not hurting anybody they're all on the same hand it listen everyone belongs on the hand like we have to forget the pinky if you were as strong physically as your small toe wow that's crazy that's life just everything can [\\xa0__\\xa0] you up every pebble is murderous every jumping upstairs the wrong way you stub your toe you want to die if you that's who you are you are as strong as your little baby toe your little baby toe has zero power grab your little baby toe and like wrestle with it real quick it has nothing a it's a baby yeah they call it a baby toe cuz it's like a it's not babies are stronger than your baby toe yeah yeah well look a [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass little limb that's yeah that would that's the funny thing about the human sentient projection into time is like we're probably like the little toe of the universe you know like we have just enough realization to know that we're something we're this hilarious intersection of like you know meat and what appear like a real feeling of like you know I do feel like uh bias aside if there isn't a part of you that hasn't like really come to the conclusion that there seems to be a part of you that doesn't get touched by reality the some Eternal part of you that has met time and space uh I I I feel like most people get that sense kids feel that they they know that they just actually know it but you know to me I think maybe what we are in this little temporary whatever it may be whether it's an aquarium whether it's a training facility I think it's probably a training facility you know like I don't think it's that I think it's a process and I think the process has to be tumultuous CU if it's not nothing gets done I think the struggles have to exist because if there's only Harmony and peace everybody gets stagnant I think right there's there's a steady push towards ultimate technological innovation that's the steadiest push if you look at the human race in terms of like what it makes like what does it do at the end of the day if you have these bees and they have all this different thing all these different social things they do and all these different things they do for covering territory and ground and all these different aspects of being a bee and laying the larvae inside the honeycomb but what do they do what do they they make honey [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's what they do they make honey what do we do we make robots we make computers we make technology and we make it better every [\\xa0__\\xa0] year we don't make better laws every year like no no no we don't revise that [\\xa0__\\xa0] we got stuff written with [\\xa0__\\xa0] ink from charcoal you know [\\xa0__\\xa0] like in the archive somewhere what we do is we make better [\\xa0__\\xa0] every year we make better [\\xa0__\\xa0] and our goal is just keep making better [\\xa0__\\xa0] and I'm obsessed with better [\\xa0__\\xa0] I'm obsessed with like cell phones and I'm obsessed I love like unbox therapy or um any any of those shows Marcus brownley when they doing these unbox videos and talking about the newest latest and greatest technology and they're showing these 120 HZ screens and these [\\xa0__\\xa0] cameras with 100x optical zoom like amazing but what are we doing we're moving ourselves closer and closer to some kind of technological superiority and along the way we're losing our humanity and that's the weirdest most ironic part of it along the way of we we've never been in a a greater technological era if you look in terms of the things that are consumer electronics that get released right now whether it's laptops or iPhones or you know Samsung Note 20s or whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] they are these things are insane right never been in a time like this before this is like this is peaked also when have we ever had a time where there's riots in every city every city all across the country and it's all a lot of it is things that most people agree with right you say especially if you say something like black lives matter I want let's have a vote how many people don't agree with that statement just forget about what the this everybody want oh it's a Marxist thing and these people they they want to destroy the nuclear family I don't know if they do or they don't but most people I bet who are who are a part of that movement don't even know what that means they don't know all that [\\xa0__\\xa0] they just don't want people to get killed by cops that's it that's it and it's not like Michael Chay has a great bit about it where it says like that's not even asking a lot like matters like black lives matter just matters like and people like man I don't know it's this is the strangest time for us socially because of covid this is the strangest time because of the economy the strangest time because Trump is President and there's chaos and the guy who's running against him is older than him and you're like this is madness like what is what is happening here and no one knows when the [\\xa0__\\xa0] people are going to be able to go back to work and there's all this chaos and all this anxiety it's all happening together at once I know man I know that's what this is you know this is what I love like I I work my medit I work with a meditation teacher David nickar he's he's brilliant and one of the things he tells me and I really this is an example of how cool he is this is when all the New York Times [\\xa0__\\xa0] came out about the aliens I call him I'm like David New York Times aliens and he's like wow wow and then his response was Duncan where do you think thoughts come from do you think they are born from something that was his response to me telling about aliens was a question where do you think thoughts come from are thoughts like born like the way well it's a good question it's a great question I still haven't figured it out but I've asked if ideas were aliens I think that if you think about a cell phone right I mean obviously there's a collaborative effort involving a lot of people that understand all sorts of different aspects of Technology But ultimately it has to be an idea someone has to have the idea to come up the original Motorola phone the [\\xa0__\\xa0] brick and then they had the idea to innovate and keep getting better and better and these ideas eventually lead to this thing that can open your car door turn your lights on your house you can FaceTime your kids it's a crazy crazy crazy thing and it's all coming out of ideas where do they come from that's the question the question is is it an an inherent part of being a human being because like all other aspects of human beings we are not a single organism we are a a biosphere the human organism is essentially an ecosystem the human organism has Untold trillions of of of bacteria in our gut right we have it on our skin we have all sorts of weird life forms that we live synergistically in this space as a person why wouldn't we think ideas would be a part of that yeah right they might very well be a part of that and the healthier your mind is the more you're able to live with ideas the more you're able to bounce ideas around like ideas as a life form just like the health like if you use antibacterial soap all over your body all the time you get sick right you get [\\xa0__\\xa0] rashes and [\\xa0__\\xa0] because your body it kills all the good bacteria too yeah it's like man I I the I loved the question because like one of my favorite acid trips was I was like listening to Beethoven oh wow oh man and I like I like some I don't know how it happened but like I was like I I like had a little like a this beautiful girl she was so beautiful and like I was at her house we're listening to Beethoven I was tripping and I started thinking and it was just like romantic and cool and then but then I started thinking like somebody thought of this and then I started thinking but where did it where did it come from like if they thought of it what was it before they thought of it like this didn't exist before Beethoven yeah so where was it and and I remember that as I was like thinking that on on the best still to this day the best acid I ever had what's the difference I'm not much of an acid connoisseur what's the difference between really good acid and mediocre acid it apparently it has something to do with a mechanism of production right the way it's yeah yeah which is like listen to like kid Charlamagne by Steely Dan it's all about uh it's all about one of the great uh Oley one of the great LSD kist of our time uh who and I met his wife and I asked her this question like why is some why is acid not as good as it used to be in the 60s and her response was people aren't perfectionists anymore honey that was literally there we will sell no wine before it's time yeah it was like I don't I don't I don't know but well that's you mean that's a thing that we want with whiskey like that's one of the things about Buffalo Trace who bottles this stuff yeah they uh they taste everything they taste and if it's not good they don't they're connoisseurs so that we want so I understand that you would want that with acid the problem is that acid's illegal that's the real problem the problem is have some [\\xa0__\\xa0] space Daddy some dude who's at the the top of the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Helm of this spaceship as it hurls through Infinity Dy they they don't want you they have to be space daddy if it's the president of the United States that's space daddy right the president of the United States is space Daddy he is the [\\xa0__\\xa0] leader of the the greatest army the world's ever known he's at the Helm of the global Empire he that's space Daddy and he's we're going through space so if we are a spaceship the president of the United States is space Dy Captain Kirk he has to be right yeah yeah well it's not the space daddy that's made LSD illegal what's made LSD illegal was an earlier space daddy 1970 space Daddy they tried to disband the Civil Rights Movement Yeah by making drugs like all schedule one drugs yeah that space daddy did it but but good the good news is like uh they're they're at least at the very least they're they're letting people like look at how what it is and like how it affects the brain and they're beginning to understand that there like everything we all knew there's no point getting resentful about it but we all knew this we all knew this and but we're all like it's being validated thank God and it's very sweet because it's a it's a healing drug especially when used in and with therapy you know and uh it's healing it's a very powerful beautiful wonderful thing that exists on the planet that anyone could have access to especially if they like stop this ridiculous prohibition and and and lifted the prohibition I'm not saying like don't prohibit heroin prohibit heroin prohibit methamphetamin but even even any prohibition the the problem is I don't want anybody doing it but I shouldn't be able to tell you not to that's the problem that really is the problem the problem is I shouldn't be able to tell you not to that's right and and certainly like because it's too slippery but you shouldn't be able to like there shouldn't be a fiveyear mandatory minimum for LSD I mean that's Madness no that's Madness and it and it really does heal people it's a healing look you do your own like your research look into it have you read chaos the Tom O'Neal book no oh my god dude one of my favorite podcasts over the last year I did was with Tom O'Neal and he's Greg Fitz Simmons's neighbor he was Greg fit Simmons's neighbor for like 20 years in Venice and the whole time he was Greg's neighbor he was working on this book Now Greg never brings someone to me never never says dude you got to have this guy on a as a guest ever so out of all these years Greg's like dude this guy you need to have on this guy researched Charles Manson for 20 [\\xa0__\\xa0] years he was originally just writing an article he was writing an article but as he's writing this article he starts uncovering more and more crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] and he goes deeper and deeper into this war 20 [\\xa0__\\xa0] years later he finally puts out this book and this book is basically detailing a CIA LSD operation where Charles Manson was getting dosed in prison allegedly and there was he was being treated at this free clinic in Hay Ashbury that ran for more than 50 years and closed 3 months after the book was released they ran this [\\xa0__\\xa0] free clinic where they were dosing hippies and they were testing them they ran operation midnight climax it was all part of MK Ultra he's detailing step by step all these people that were directly involved in not just Charles Manson but in [\\xa0__\\xa0] Jack Ruby and all these other political figures in history and it's like what in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] all these mind control C A LSD experiments that were real and Charles Manson was a part of that allegedly and Charles Manson was dosing up these hippies and not taking it himself he was using the techniques that they allegedly used on him for like seven years while he was in federal penitenti what a mess this is the problem with like anytime power you got to read this book man I look I've look I've read a lot about the M this one crazy this one's different it's just specifically what they did to allow Manson to run free and build these murderous hippies and get them high on LSD this was all a part of this thing to sort of demonize the anti-war movement there was all these different strategies the an M yeah cuz you take LSD and War seems ridiculous you take LSD and money seems ridiculous you take LSD and anything that doesn't have to do with love seems insane and the problem is is like you know and this is you know all the Psychedelic [\\xa0__\\xa0] aside if you just look at like basic Buddhism 101 I was in some of the prior to this pandemic my favorite conversations were in Uber man and I'm writing this Uber and this Uber driver who's clearly a Buddhist he's got a Buddhist a Buddhist statue on his like dashboard and like so we started talking about Buddhism and we're talking about it and he said the coolest thing I've ever heard regarding Buddhism which is he's like do you know how you look at letters and they you think that they're a language what are you before that it's so cool holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah yeah thank God there's people like that in the world I know well that's a true Buddhist that's a true missionary but but in that in LSD will return you to that state so it will drop you under all of your apps that are running on the operating system of your Consciousness for a little bit some people hate that because they've like so identified with the apps that the moment they can't like cling to the app that they become this like you know thing before the language which is why some people on a lot of asset can't even they can't talk they talk like babies yeah but but what's happening is you're encountering like original sentients prior to conditioning and that's dangerous to uh um any kind of power structure like if I'm trying to implement a hierarchy I depend on your Consciousness flowing into these rivulets that are language morality ethics the entire structure of whatever I'm like trying to like tell you is the way things are and if I can do that then I can own you because suddenly your morality isn't real morality your ethics aren't real ethics your idea of what's right isn't necessarily what's right it's what's right for capitalism what's right for communism what's right for this or that if I can tell you if I can make your moral compass point away from service in any way shape or form I can control you forever and so anything that gets in the way of that is really like generally like delegitimate I by power structures I mean it makes sense well the problem is you're dealing with we there's a a combination of morality and a game and the game is trying to make money like when you have numbers you know I'm reading this book right now I'm listening to it on tape um it's called Uh irresistible and I keep forgetting this dude's name who uh who wrote the book but I'm listening to it on audio book it's uh Adam alter and it's all about addictions and it's all about particularly how addictive games are insanely addictive like games like Tetris and Candy Crush insanely addictive where they've made billions and billions of dollars on Candy Crush it's crazy people can't put it down like Farmland made [\\xa0__\\xa0] unbelievable amounts of money There's Something About Numbers like you see you look at your bank account you go I've got $155,000 in the bank I can't believe this that's pretty [\\xa0__\\xa0] good I remember when I was broke and then you go you know what it would be great if I had 50 I'd just like to get 20 this year I'm just going to cut back on going out to eat I'm going to do that I'm going to put five away and then you're like you know what I need to make more that's what I need to do I need to make more money I want to put in some overtime I'm G to talk to the boss I'm gonna lick I'm dedicated I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] a lot of people get tired I don't get tired dude I am dedicated to this [\\xa0__\\xa0] job and I want to move up in this company and the boss is like yes come on aboard slave man you're going to work for the corporation 18 hours a day great you're you're you're getting paid well don't get me wrong you're not really a slave but what you are is a slave to your own idea of what success is you got you're a slave to these the idea that numbers equate success yeah you don't notice man you don't notice you don't notice you get used to everywhere you live it's nice if you live in a place that's safe after that you I'm telling you you don't notice you know what you notice you notice when your friends are around you and you're enjoying each other's company and you're laughing and having fun you notice those things you notice if you do something and people enjoy it you notice if you you have a good interaction action with someone at a store like they go no you and then you go no you and then you're both smiling and laughing and everybody's you're you're having that's those are nice moments man we have those we still have those like you let somebody in front of you and they give you the PE on you give them the thumbs up and these moments are still here man they're more than they're not it's not like everybody just stabbing everybody everywhere you look most of the interactions that people have with each other all over the place are positive that's right it's a very small amount the problem is these small amounts making on [\\xa0__\\xa0] YouTube and then that's all I can watch there you go I just watch these [\\xa0__\\xa0] people in Portland beat the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of each other and kick some guy in the head when he's sitting on his he's sitting down when he apparently drove too close to these antifa guys and they made him get out of the car and they're searching his belongings this guy runs up behind him and kicks him in the head and knocks him unconscious horrible and I'm like God damn it but it's not most people most of the time and the problem is that's what everybody's going to pay attention to that's what everybody's going to share on Facebook and Instagram I saw that [\\xa0__\\xa0] video video in my timeline like 30 times but this is what I love about humanity is like if you strip away the story and you see a person getting kicked in the head honestly man like I don't care like in general like I don't care what that guy is don't kick him in the head here's the problem dude is a natural inclination to want to fight the opposite of your tribe yeah and when you're 16 years old or however old that kid well the kid who kicked that guy in the head he looked young to me I could have easily done that when I was 16 easily I was so dumb if I was in the streets at 16 he was Dumb and we pulled some guy out of his car that someone said tried to run us over and the guy's sitting there easily me or any of the people I hung out with would have punched that guy or kicked that guy that's the compassion that's normal it's normal the problem is the tribal war that we have going on that's the problem that's but what you just said that's the truth that's the truth and it's compassionate this this is a stupid kid he was a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I think he worked at the airport whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] he was this is a stupid kid and and and what he did is wrong he got caught up in the wave of violence the mob mentality it's normal we have to figure out listen man here here's the thing we must discover you're not first of all you're not going to find this on the map I like going off the map but there's not a map for this so that's deliberating to me we got to get off the map number one we got to get off the map like first everyone this is what's so crazy people are really legitimately tuning into like the like human trafficking in the United States it's a big business it's one of the biggest businesses actually human trafficking yeah I was reading a post today that somebody sent me and I don't know if it's verified or real or whatever where a girl was saying that she was headed to a a bathroom at a uh gas station somewhere and uh someone she noticed that someone was had their camera turned around so they like had the selfie camera on where they're on FaceTime and they pointed to this lady and they said what about her she she heard her say what about her do you like her and the girl looked at them and and the lady turned and looked at her and she ran back to her car got in their car and the guy who was with them went and ran up to the side of the car like she thinks they were trying to kidnap her 100% they were and that that happens that happens that happens that's a real business this is not like this is not a a [\\xa0__\\xa0] story this is not a magazine article where people are you know someone wrote some fiction this is right and the funny thing not funny but what what's ironic about the sudden horror at human trafficking is a lot of the very same people who are fighting against this thing that they're they're realizing is happening in the country simultaneously don't want to look back into the history of the United States which was 100% based on human trafficking 100% our country 's Foundation is human trafficking they [\\xa0__\\xa0] kidnapped black people and made them work for free and somewhere in between that horror and now people have gotten this delusion that that stopped it didn't stop our country is was literally founded George Washington did you know this was the number one slave holder in uh Virginia wherever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] he was he was the number one slave supposedly his wooden teeth thing it was slave teeth yeah he was the number one slaveholder did he have wooden gums is that what it was I don't the whole wooden tee thing was a replacement of the truth which is this [\\xa0__\\xa0] was a human trafficker so people try to like they try to revise so the idea is like you know let's look at this look at this Washington's Dentures were likely sourced from the teeth of slaves sourced there you go they're going to say sourced that wasn't sourc they were ripped out of the [\\xa0__\\xa0] mouth of human hostages don't say sourced I Source avocados to my [\\xa0__\\xa0] Mexican restaurant I don't Source teeth [\\xa0__\\xa0] why would you use that language why would you use that language yeah it's not Source go back to that Jamie can I read the rest of it um records at Mount Vernon show that he bought teeth from slaves bought them but that's Records who knows if the slaves actually got the money the poor enslaved had been selling teeth as a means of making money since the Middle Ages which were sold Dentures or implants to those of financial means either way man so so you know Jeffrey Epstein J Jeffrey Epstein Source teeth from some of the young girls he was [\\xa0__\\xa0] and it was actually common for the young girls to sell their teeth for money like it's it that that right there that right there is the root of the [\\xa0__\\xa0] problem which is like this country George Washington was a human trafficker who had in his mouth the teeth of people that were kidnapped he was making work for free this makes dmer look like a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Boy Scout can you imagine if look at this quote according to George Washington's Ledger on May 8th 1784 he paid 62 shillings to Negroes for nine teeth on account of Dr Le Moine so he paid six pounds two Shillings I don't know how much that is who cares for nine teeth so this says does this say he's paying it to the slaves it actually says they don't know if they were slaves or not probably paid it to the doctor to extract it Jesus Christ but it wasn't what but so there were free black men that lived in America but how what was the percentage versus slaves and free men who cares the main thing is this [\\xa0__\\xa0] who's in statues everywhere was a kidnapper who like took teeth out of people's mouths and put it in his own mouth that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and so like Well everybody's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up in our all of our all of our holidays like Columbus was one of the worst people of all time yeah so this whole like when people are defending the statues it's like shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up but here's the thing man should you allow people to just pull down the statues really yep what do you think because do you think here's what I think what if there were Jeffrey dmer statues all over La no you make a good point but what maybe we should educate people on why you feel so strongly about like the George Washington statute or even the Thomas Jefferson statue a lot of people are arguing that Thomas Jefferson that you know he he's a piece of [\\xa0__\\xa0] and we shouldn't respect him either how do you do you think that all those statues should come down or do you think it's more of an imperative for us to understand that in the world of 1776 or in the world of whenever when did Washington get here what was George Washington's first years in America I'm not in any way shape or form giving anyone a free pass on owning slaves I don't think anybody that that's all what I'm saying anybody who thinks that about but what I am saying is I think human beings up until he was born in Virginia oh he was born in America George Wasington one of the first Real Americans Jeffrey D one of [\\xa0__\\xa0] it I'm getting a George Washington tattoo Joe I'm in I'm in what's wrong with you he's American no look can I the statue question this is what I think okay either take the statue down or put around it the number of slaves he had build statues for all the slaves he had so if George Washington had 4,000 slaves there needs to be a field of slave statues around the George Washington statue that you have to walk through to get to to the George Washington statue or just pull it down CU you know what it's easier to pull it down no no no no no you're right though have the slaves and have some of them missing teeth because they sold it to him because they need we'd have to find out if you really bought teeth from slaves or if it's just regular folks needed money just have the whole story there like that's all just have the whole story so people realize what's what you're saying is perfect like if you're going to have a guy who victimized I mean everybody did it back then everybody of wealth did it it was a normal thing to do to have people that you owned as crazy as that sounds to us dude I think that the world before mass communication before the post office and certainly before any kind of uh boat travel when when everyone was just either on foot or on horses was [Music] undeniably impossible for us to understand because they were so Savage there was very few rules people were just dying of syphilis and every other [\\xa0__\\xa0] disease that came around the bend whether it was the flu or the plague there was no sanitation everyone was a rapist it was just a a a a wild barely human thing that occasionally paint cool things and write things down and compose music but lived in a Savage environment that's almost unrecognizable for us today I don't look I and again man like I'm presenting a Counterpoint to you that I I don't want people to pray upon me for the Counterpoint saying oh woke Doug it had a baby got all woke but like but I do want to present a CounterPoint in the in in with the intention of like let's look at like that the maybe that is actually part of the conditioning which is like if if like so if your country is based on human trafficking which to this day is happening well this country is based on human trafficking this country is based on and it's also based on human sacrifice in the it's also based on us killing the people that were here first that's right and we've been at War for 92% of our history and many of those Wars are based on nothing so you know people are up in arms about the Bohemian Grove but it's like give me a [\\xa0__\\xa0] break look atam that's human sacrifice there was money to be made from killing people and they made money so we have a country that's based on human trafficking and Human Sacrifice nobody wants to talk about it the idea is the exact same thing that all abusers do to people they've abused they want you to number one forget it and if you start remembering it they tell you you're crazy or that you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] up so the idea is that like the world prior to the United States was a Savage World Savage Africa was not Savage these were very Advanced people but because like the Europeans were were Savage we brutal people they went in there and [\\xa0__\\xa0] just started chopping people up these are people who had a natural innate trust for other humans and they were like put your hand out slap go get some gold or I'll cut your other one off that's what they did when they came here to North America right it was Hills Have Eyes level so The Hills Have Eyes roll into all indigenous cultures they're in tuned with the earth when [\\xa0__\\xa0] gets weird they move look I'm not but but here's the thing I've been spending the last six months deeply engrossed in Native American books and they weren't that nice not at all dude they ate each other the Nez purse were like practicing cannibals yeah the nzp Indians were practicing cannibals listen man the commes killed everybody they were bral they killed everybody they killed each other they killed Native Americans they would their main thing was raiding they'd raid tribes and steal and kill and murder and rape the idea I've heard and this may not be I I didn't look into it and I I apologize to the people who told me about this idea because I wish i' I'd researched it more but I'm going to put it out there is that Africa was a was a really ancient culture that was dude Africa is where Egypt is EXA that's people don't recognize people were sending people there to get educated before slavery even started before they burned the Library of Alexandria that was the place where everybody would go to learn things yes and so we [\\xa0__\\xa0] went in there and just re Havoc not us it wasn't us we can't say we I'm sorry from North Carolina love that I burped right I was born in New Jersey we can't say we we made you made a very profound point and I burped no but we didn't do it no I don't I don't I don't mean we I don't mean we and I'm not saying like I'm directly connected I'm just saying like for me it's like the anytime I get around any situation where someone is making it so I can't say the truth right I get really annoyed yes yes which is why you're comic it freaks me out yes and it freaks me out and so the reason that the whole like the whatever the particular movement is like when Trump is it like the Mount Rushmore and that's Lota right that's like sacred land that's like sacred land but like they went in there and they chopped up a mountain with a bunch of SLA like slave owner faces and Trump's like it's the best mountain on Earth it's like it look better before you put the human traffickers on it right how about the [\\xa0__\\xa0] hilarity of him suggesting that his face should be on it just to R people up yeah there's some part of you as a comic that has to appreciate that I'm sorry Joe I'm going to admit that's true when I when I when I saw that he was suggesting that his name should be on Mount Everest I or not at Mount Everest Mount Rushmore I was I was thinking immediately like oh my God he's he's he's moving them into Checkmate dude look at my [\\xa0__\\xa0] Twitter I've been like seven different personalities designed to rile people up over the last month that's all you do with this q and on thing Jamie was hoping you would come in as your q and on character it's fine look no but like does that should that person be president no but listen but that's hilarious when in this madness with all this crazy there's no such thing as gender world for a guy to come around and say I'm going to put my face on Mount Rushmore like this this part of that that I like well listen I'm to be honest I'm not a fan of his lack of empathy that's what beautiful that's what's beautiful about you is you're not afraid to admit something that I think is really important to admit which is like dude there are like there are there's a Continuum of reality and there's swaths of that Continuum that are amazing like I don't know if you've ever been in in a situation where like maybe you're in a kind of like relationship that's not great but there's a piece of that relationship that is so [\\xa0__\\xa0] hot and so sexy and so beautiful in the midst of all the madness that it almost like makes the madness makes sense right that's a that's a or or certainly like there's certain like sub subance as I embibe that if you look at what they do to my body it's like terrible but like that sliver of whatever it is is great so anyway what I love that you're not afraid of doing is like putting out there like look man it's not like people are one thing but here's the thing too I'm not a willing victim of gaslighting you can't you can't do that to me right I'm not interested you know I don't need anything from you I'm not interested in you gaslighting me I know when someone's putting on a show I had an email from a guy who I like who told me to stop talking about Joe Biden because all the problems are because he has a stutter and I'm like listen man when you're 74 or however old he is he's older than that right the wheels come off man on everybody right I I don't feel as sharp at 53 as I did at 33 how about that yeah the reality is there's days if I'm not on top of my [\\xa0__\\xa0] game I get real Spacey yeah what happens in 25 years come on man are we pretending that we live forever you we need young vibrant robust people with a lot of energy who but who are also Advanced thinkers and right now they don't have any one of those people in the race we got craziness in the race well no no you know man like the thing with Biden is like forget about B like the pro like I'm voting for [\\xa0__\\xa0] Biden you going suck my dick I'm voting for Biden do we have to do that are you going to do it anyway not suck your dick and why can't I get a [\\xa0__\\xa0] on top of it seems greedy it would be nice look I'm sorry to be aggressive man this this liquor like it's bringing out something bad that's what I love about whiskey Whiskey's been responsible for some of my favorite conversations look man shout out to Buffalo Trace I like the reality of the situation is like Biden I I don't like his policy regarding drugs and I'm very resentful of a lot of the things he's done and I'm also very resentful of the fact that that that's what I'm like being that's the the binary that I'm being forced to like contend with here that's the resentment right is that we only have these two sanction choices and if you're a good person who doesn't want people to die in the streets you you have to vote blue that's it period that's it in the initial phases of it when I was trying to like I was hoping Bernie would be the [\\xa0__\\xa0] front runner and I'm like I [\\xa0__\\xa0] Bernie up dude Bernie got attached to some jokes what do you mean I Bernie came on my podcast and he I I I did a very lukewarm endorsement of Bernie like I can't do stand up right now so I'll just tell you this Bernie did this very lukewarm I I did a lukew I said I'll probably vote I had my friend Barry Weiss on from The New York Times and she said who are you gonna vote for I said I'll probably vote for Bernie I said he makes sense I like what he stands for the guy's been Rock Solid his whole life he's always believing like we it would be good to have a change where someone gets into office we go this guy really believes in Justice he's not greedy he's not beholding the corporations well they ran with that and then all these people that were in competition with Bernie started pulling [\\xa0__\\xa0] that I've said on the podcast drunk high as [\\xa0__\\xa0] stand up comedy put it in cont put it in in quotes I remember that and uh there was one of them I read this article that was like on a real a real newspaper um where uh in quotes it said he believes that lesbians lack the lower back muscles to [\\xa0__\\xa0] a woman correctly what this is a piece of my act it was a bit it was a bit about a conversation that I had at a bar I was with a friend of mine at a bar and there's this lady who's really aggressive who's making out with her girlfriend and she yells over it at us she goes sorry boys she only likes girls and I got my own dick she says this to us yeah so I go where is it and she goes it's a strap on and I said having a strap on thinking it's a dick is like having a lighter and thinking you're a dragon plus everyone knows that lesbians lack the proper lower black muscles to [\\xa0__\\xa0] a woman correctly it was like I was in this sparring match this verbal sparring match with this crazy lady that's what I said you can't just take that part out and put it in quotes and say what really believe that lesbians lack the proper lower back muscles to be in a loving relationship with another woman who's also a lesbian that's not what I said [\\xa0__\\xa0] I can't trust you on anything how am I going to trust you with Russia or climate change or anything will you lie about jokes right because you they didn't want a guy who wasn't beholden to the system so there was two people that I was interested in Tulsi gabard who's a she's been a congresswoman for six years I love her she's she served overseas twice Rock Solid she's a real leader and they didn't want to have nothing to do with her you know T plant the Hari krishna's sing to good I hope they get in let's give it a chance May they're right they seen those harras I I I I mean I'm like really eating my ass here cuz like there was a period where I'm like you know what [\\xa0__\\xa0] this I'm not going to let the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Democratic party shove this [\\xa0__\\xa0] who's like was like Pro all these what happens if he dies kamla becomes president and then does she have to get a new vice president who does she get as a vice pres to get a vice president she get AOC cuz you don't have to be a certain you don't have to be a certain age to be vice president AOC I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] what anybody says about her she's wonderful I love her she's awesome eat me alive I don't care look at me who cares I I think she's awesome I love her so much and and I'm going to get [\\xa0__\\xa0] for it too but I think the errors that she makes she makes because she has this idea that she's trying to do good I really believe that she's also 30 yeah how [\\xa0__\\xa0] dumb were you when you were 30 you know one of the things about Bridget fety who's hilarious Bridget fety is amazing what what happened here have to be 35 to be vice president just like sorry hang in there in the wings baby will vote for you pick you up in term two I will vote for you I think she's trying to do good but Bridget fety who's one of my favorite people to to talk to she said that when she read a diary that she wrote or a journal that she wrote when she was 24 she's like Jesus Christ I was AOC and now she's like much more of a Centrist in fact like she's like always mocking woke [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know and she's like but I was like fullon woke when I was 24 get it it's a thing of a person being a good person who's compassionate who wants to do good for people who thinks they're moving in the right direction but the problem is it's not in align with the understanding that we have currently of psychology and of how people behave and of of laws and the the the idea of punishment and crime like you have to have some of that stuff you have to have incentives for people to do well but you also have to have disincentives for them they have to be punished if they commit crimes you have to have Law and Order but you have to have compassion you have to have good will but you have to have you have to have law you have you have to model it on good parenting man it's like yes that's what that's where it's and and also good Community I think parenting is one aspect of your your ability to develop growing up you like neighbors are important too man friends absolutely uncles all those people are important in your life the aunts you know everybody your grandparents there they're import there's a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] going on there input coming into a person I just love like thinking like what's outside of propaganda parenting it isn't outside of propaganda but you can look like as a parent I can see like look it doesn't matter what my ideals are regarding regulation Forest is not going to be allowed yeah to go into the pool unless I'm there with him 100% he'll die he'll die so there's like real like there's like a a true like to me there's a an eternal sort of path in in like looking at what good parenting is across cultur cultures and you realize like you know you're an idiot if you think that people in the vast number of humans on Earth if you think that people in that vast number aren't insane like what percentage are insane like well you're insane everybody's insane what isane that's the problem like what by what is that metric you know a [\\xa0__\\xa0] yard is 3 ft saying I'm talking like like people who are like registered sex offenders or you know what I mean like that that like pathos like true narcissist true sociopaths like we live in a world where from time to time but it's still a spectrum right cuz like what if someone's saying but they're a gambling addict and they keep losing all their families money every year on poker games right we got to figure out a way to help them without simultaneously creating tyranny have you [\\xa0__\\xa0] with ibaan no I don't want it man I'm terrified of that [\\xa0__\\xa0] I haven't [\\xa0__\\xa0] with iasa I smoke DMT from time to time but I'm scared of a 6-h hour DMT trip much less IA gain freak have you done IA gain no I don't have any like uh physical addictions that I'm trying to kick or real uh personal addictions I've kind of got those things dialed in in terms of my workout and you know work schedule and Family schedule it's pretty good right now I got a good Harmony I got a good Rhythm and I'm going to keep that up yeah but um people that I know that have really needed it or people that got hurt and then they got uh prescribed pain pills and the pain pill is what got them I know quite a few people that have turned to the Ia gain two good friends that have turned to the Ia gain and it knocked them right off uh of the addiction and right back on path and it's really disturbing to me because it's not it it doesn't seem to be killing people and it's not legal and uh I think going forward in this country we're going to have to come to grips with a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] one of the things we're going to have to come to grips with is uh we've got and this is not a bad thing okay if any company should is allowed to donate to a political candidate any company a [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know any company Chocolate Company a company that buy makes cars if then a drug company probably should too if they're allowed to sell drugs maybe they should be allowed to to to to give money to corporations or give money rather to politicians that are running for government why not why everybody can do it who's to say they can't and the [\\xa0__\\xa0] guys who make cars can when they're polluting the air okay who knows but at the end of the day we have to go yo there's a lot of people getting hooked on these pills yeah there's a lot of people ruining their lives in these pills and we're turning a blind eye because there's a lot of money involved in these pills and it's weird it's weird it's weird like the cigarette thing it's if we're so worried about 170,000 people dying of covid why aren't we worried about half a million dying from cigarettes why aren't we worried about all the people that not just dying but losing their [\\xa0__\\xa0] their Sanity on opioids how many people in this country are hooked on [\\xa0__\\xa0] pain pills is it I mean do we even know the real number cuz how many people are functional where they're hooked on it but they're just like taking one or two a day and they're just going to work every day and they just stay in this steady Haze of [\\xa0__\\xa0] working for [\\xa0__\\xa0] uh you know HTS rent a car and they just deal and they got a prescription so it's all good doctor says hair Brave New World baby Brave New World this is uh all this these are all the things that I think of and I this is it gives me a this is the perspective that I have in this day and age right now as I'm talking to you a place of humility because I I I'm more aware now than any other time in my life that no one is in control of this thing and that we all have to just stop thinking that Daddy's going to rescue us that's right CU there is no Daddy garcetti's not your daddy Gavin Newsome's not your daddy Donald Trump's not your daddy Nancy Pelosi is not your mama none of these things the these are just people and we have to look at this in an objective first of all anyone who's famous anyone I don't care if you're Donald Trump or Nancy Pelosi those are famous people everybody knows their name everybody knows what they look like that's a wild way to live that's a wild crazy way to live yeah that's a crazy way to live and then you're out there also dictating what people can and can't do and you're also dictating where the taxes go you're Auto you're not the idea is like by becoming famous you become antithetical to the very thing that you're representing so how can you represent it anymore if you have you I'm not saying you can't but I'm saying that's a that's a different ride that's a different that's a different ride than a regular person yeah if you're if you're a famous person and you're all of a sudden at the the Helm of an Empire that's dropping drone bombs on people [\\xa0__\\xa0] you woo shouldn't the greatest government be a government that has an idea of eventually there'll be no more government there should be but then you have [\\xa0__\\xa0] like 9/11 you go what happened we get attacked if if we know but did we I don't know I don't know what happened what happened I don't know who trained those people who designed that a lot of things happen afterwards that people will say did those things that happen afterwards happen because and this is my belief my belief is that all the things that happened after 911 in terms of like uh the Patriot Act and all these other things they happened because people were taking advantage of an opening where they recognized that a lot of people were scared and then they started implementing these ideas that they would love to do during peace time but they would be accepted that's my the dogs of war but this is my interpretation some people are under the impression that they actually orchestrated the event and then afterwards implementing these new rules and everybody went along with it because the event they orchestrated now I'm not saying I know that that's not the case and this is what's the scariest [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing to admit when you know about operation Northwoods you know that the government 1963 was literally planning on blowing up a jet airliner and blaming it on Cuba they were going to arm Cuban friendlies and attack Guantanamo Bay they're going to do whatever they could to get us into a war with Cuba this was signed by The Joint Chiefs of Staff they're like I like it I like deception I like what you're going to do you're going to kill people woo let's go to war baby go to war if they did that in what was it 62 or 63 who who knows how that's evolved right why why wouldn't that evolve everything evolv evolves okay technology evolves her understanding of uh bi biology evolves everything evolves everything evolves tell you know what evolved what evolved was not the technique what evolved was the story the technique seems to be the same you look at the news that Putin opponent he [\\xa0__\\xa0] Keels over in an airplane moaning all you had to drink was tea the Kremlin apparently says we wish him a speedy recovery and everyone's like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] and it's like wait actually the use of poison and imperialism is a pretty classic basic technique like not just in Game of Thrones but like in general if you're an imperialist and your interest is like power you you use whatever technique you have to use to doesn't that technique and using it in that way point to this thing that we're really worried about what we're really worried about is there this there's this underlying narrative that's going on where these Elites are battling it out and these Warlords these evil sociopaths that run the world are battling it out all the well they don't think they but they don't do it out they don't just have a guy just [\\xa0__\\xa0] blow his brains out on the airplane and then just jump right off on the tarmac and then he gets rescued by the Russian police and then nobody says anything about it ever no they do it in a weird sneaky way where it's like there's some plausible deniability involved right well they for number one they don't think they're evil Putin doesn't wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and go I'm an evil Jackal what are the henchmen of the Apocalypse Putin probably wakes up in the morning I imagine he stretches he looks at his phone he's got texts from his friends he's like that [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] that [\\xa0__\\xa0] and then he like and then more than likely he probably exercises and then he go and he I bet a lot of times Putin wakes up in the morning he's like I don't want to go to work I bet a lot of times he's like God damn it I just want to [\\xa0__\\xa0] off all day then he has to go to work he's stuck being Putin Trump wakes up in the morning same problem he's like this sucks he's drinking diet coke watching Fox News promise you TW out crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] he wakes up in the morning like takes whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] drug he's on what do you think he's taking dude I don't know want some of it if he had a guess he's on some kind of he's on amphetamin I would say I don't know what it is but some sort of diet pill was it ever confirmed that that whole thing where they said they found the very R Dwayne Reed Pharmacy in New York City where he had been taking going beat up somebody for being on drugs listen to me man he's 74 he wins okay if you can make that much money while you're on amphetamines and you don't die then they're right the doctors are right the doctor likes it's safe he's like are you sure I want to make money I want to keep going I don't want to sleep like just take this [\\xa0__\\xa0] you don't have to sleep and he just keeps going he rattles off [\\xa0__\\xa0] campaign speeches and hops in a helicopter and flies a thousand miles away find me a 70-year-old not on drugs and I will give you a $100 give me a [\\xa0__\\xa0] break you're 70 you're going to die in like 20 you're going to die like if when I'm 7 oh my mouth is going to be like a baby bird underneath any drugs that any wants to put in of course we we're both high now yeah drugs are fine like I don't care if Trump is on drugs or Putin's on drugs or whoever's on drugs it's like the point is like the these the problem is that like we like to imagine like Trump wakes up in the morning and it's like let me destroy this country Trump wakes up in the morning in a haze he takes some weird drugs he tries to remember what he's doing I promise you every morning he thinks to himself why the [\\xa0__\\xa0] did I listen to my kid I guarantee it was this kid he's like Dad you got to run for president no he's like no no no no no no you don't think you think he want I don't think he wants to be president no no no it was Obama talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] about him 100% 100% when when Obama was doing that dinner you know that uh that's that uh that thing that they do every year where they have comedians go what's it called again Jamie the Press roast White House correspondence Center yeah White House correspondence Center and Donald Donald Trump's in the audience and Barack Obama's going deep and he's hitting it with some bombs it was good it was good and one of the things he hits him with is here's one thing I am that you'll never be president of the United States and everybody goes oh it's like you know that Meme with the kid in the hoodie with the glasses and he's just standing there all the other kids are running around going oh he summ a demon can we hear some of this or we get in trouble it was a brutal resist is that like uh public domain or anything I don't know do you think he wrote it do you think he wrote it I don't think he wrote it oh sure he would write that because Trump was a part of the birther moment but here's the thing honestly legitimately I hope he was born in Kenya I hope they pulled it off cuz I don't care cuz my grandparents are born in Italy I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't need you to be born this patch of dirt you know why CU I'm not a [\\xa0__\\xa0] idiot I don't think you should have to be born on a patch of dirt look should you be have to be born in uh [\\xa0__\\xa0] Calabasas in order to be the president of uh noou or whatever that's a bad example but you have to live it's a restaurant a sushi restaurant Malu do you have to live like in the town like what what are you saying the all the patch of dirt is significant where was you expelled out of the vagina I I moved here when I was 13 minutes old is that okay what if I what if I my mom shat me out in the middle of a plane on the way across the Pacific am I American who cares it's stupid it's dumb it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] dumb well it's that's like geospatial centrism I hope he's born in Kenya I hope I hope he admits it I hope he says oh and by the way I was born in Kenya oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] if Obama wanted to you know you have that everybody has like one friend like please come out come out of the closet please please no one will no one will care this is there's never been a better time if OB I'm not saying Obama was born in Kenya I believe everything he says I believe he was born in Hawaii but part of me wishes he was actually born in Kenya and he waits until after the election and if Biden wins he just gets to the m by the way I was born in Kenya oh and the whole audience just goes B the Earth turns into a son everything would erupt man I got to pee I got to pee go pee but what are you going to do when I go pee Jamie has editing equipment oh right he's the wizard don't take headphones off headphones Don't Run Away you WRA behind the back that was close I don't want it to end we're not we don't have to end okay great great there was one thing that I wanted to make sure um when we decided to go to Spotify one the one of the first things I thought of is Duncan trussle has to be episode number one that was like a legitimate thing I thought because there's something about my relationship with Duncan it's very unique like he brings things out of me he he puts me in a the when you're around certain friends they put you in a state of mind that you don't go into when you're not with them when I'm with Joey Diaz one of the things I love about Joey Diaz I'm always smiling when I'm with Joey Diaz first of all cuz he knows I love him I've I've loved him forever we've been friends for every every time I see him I hug him him so because he knows I love him when we're around he just starts talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] he he gets loose cuz he knows that I'm his number one fan and uh another person like that is Duncan when I'm around Duncan there's something like we do to each other like we're like some sort of a weird epoxy where you mix it together where he puts my mind in a place that it doesn't ordinarily go to automat like I think I genuinely believe there's ideas that I form when I'm talking to Duncan like ideas pop in my head when I'm talking to him that they don't get there anywhere else and it's it kind of goes in with what we're talking about about that other guy's idea of uh thoughts and and my my concept of ideas that maybe they're a life form maybe they're just like eoli that lives in your gut or the Flora that's on your skin and that they different people have different combinations of those things just like some people people you just don't Vibe with them you talk to them you just want to get away from them as quick as possible you like oh this person's so annoying and you can't help it for whatever reason it's like they say that women firmon wise like women can smell a man's clothes and they can sort of I don't know if this is true but I read that they can accurately depict if they smell a man's clothes whether or not they uh should be attracted to that man whether or not they're genetically they they match up well with that man but that gets [\\xa0__\\xa0] up when they're on birth control yeah that's when they're on birth control it gets confused yeah it's well it's it's in sex of daon but it was a real study and there's a real uh concern about that that people are you know you we're losing some of our senses dude I was in a relationship with a woman who got off birth control and stop wanting to [\\xa0__\\xa0] me and I remember like hearing that and like being able to refer to the moment that she seemed to be really into me but then she got out of birth control and suddenly her like real intuition was like you don't want to make babies with this guy this guy's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and she stopped She Stopped it was real like I remember the moment it happened it was so bizarre it was like it it was great I'm glad by the way I'm glad cuz like the baby that we made is so beautiful and like have you heard this [\\xa0__\\xa0] about the egg picks the sperm have you heard about this how the egg does this is the new research it's like you know as dudes were always like well we make the come and there's a sperm that makes it to the end of the race and that's the one that makes the baby so in our minds we're like it's our it's like a sperm that won a marathon gets into the egg as a reward for winning the marathon but now the idea is the egg actually is like the sperm are running to the finish line and the Egg sends out chemicals to destabilize certain sperm and picks the one that fits best with the the the the whatever the plan of the egg is look at that human eggs use chemical signals to attract sperm humans spend a lot of time and energy choosing their partner new study by researchers from Stockholm University and Manchester University NHS Foundation trust shows that choosing your partner continues even after sex human eggs can choose sperm it's the goddest baby dudes it's like the last [\\xa0__\\xa0] Bastion we had was this idea that we had this athletic little bit of our come that made it it's really the mother egg that picks it off come come to me come to me and the rest back to Mama it sends out signals to destroy certain sperm trying to make that made it all that way chosy eggs May pick sperm for their genes defying Mel's law we're we're done but then again the sperm that get there those are still at the front of the pack yeah like in Price is Right they're the on most likely the egg you know the eggs get like look I want the best SPM but the best one's going to be the one that's there first anyway it's maybe it's both things it's good it's sweet it's it's sweet it's kind of both things right yeah but the final decision is the egg [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass lazy sperm that just bounces off the head of the rugged sperm and like winds up plop wow can't believe you chose me she like I didn't [\\xa0__\\xa0] now I have a nerd and the the egg gets really pissed because it's not a precise mechanism there's a lot of chaos going on to encourage you know entropy and to encage Innovation that they figure out how to better the better uh version of the species to get into the egg but sometimes there's a head butt and then the dumb Dum goes right in head first and bang you got a kid that's not that bright you don't want that kid but then that being said so those kids are supposed to get eaten by Coyotes on one level it's great because it says actually the goddess chooses everything but then on another level you've got Hitler exactly so that Hitler's mom's egg had a bunch of other sperm that were like we're not doing a genocide and what's the connection with what we talked about before with Hitler amphetamines yeah Hitler was all about they would inject Coke in him and testosterone in him there's a legendary story about how melini wanted to talk to Hitler about pulling out of the war and Hitler showed up shot up with cocaine and testosterone and just yeah I don't even musini know what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] he was saying but he sweated on him until musolini relented dude I don't know if that's true McKenna used to talk about alcohol in this way like the idea like we survived alcohol just like the well he talked about alcohol being the differentiation between the ancient psychedelic cultures they like uh chop tall hi that worship the cattle which like shat on the ground the mushrooms grow from and they had all this mushroom iconography to when they started preserving things and preserving things in Honey which meant fermented honey which meant meat which meant alcohol and then they switched to an alcohol-based society when they couldn't grow the mushrooms anymore because of climate change or because they were moving and moving in different directions this is what I think happened this is where I disagree with McKenna what I think first of all how confident are you not that confident the fact that you say I disagree with McKenna I was about to apologize to Dennis McKenna and say I acknowledge I'm a complete dope well he he disagrees with his brother sometimes yeah but he disagrees in Le and ethnobotanist disagrees with a scientist not in the way some [\\xa0__\\xa0] guy somebody literally goes at night goes to Red a conspiracy and disagrees who literally on a show called Joe Rogan questions everything we investigated UFO materials I'm sure like Stephen Hawking disagreed with Albert Einstein you went to a bunker to talk to a dude who's going to start a cult and you're like hey you guys grow tomatoes no like I'm I'm I remember coming back I'm like what was that guy like like he was a really nice guy I'm like well kind a nice guy digs a hole the side of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] mountain and Parks his SUV this guy's crazy bro it's so stupid to say I disagree with with with like one of the great mods and I acknowledge that uh but but uh you know to me like this is where this is what I picture happening so okay we're storing our mushrooms in jars of alcohol right we're storing our mushrooms in jars of alcohol and the rich people the elites eat the mushrooms they all trip out in their little orgiastic [\\xa0__\\xa0] awesome thing and then who's left the people whose job it is to put the mushrooms and the alcohol and what's left these jars they have a little bit of booze in them and some mushroom residue they drink it and then they start you know like that would be the beginning of like getting [\\xa0__\\xa0] up on alcohol I I I guess what I'm saying is like I I imagine that like really like if you look at like okay mushrooms or LSD or any psychedelic it teaches you you're a we not an i you're a we not a me and and and and booze what does it teach you you're a me when you're all pissed off on booze 100% of the time you're not angry because you're like worried about the conditions of the world you're usually angry cuz someone like what's funnier than when you like insult an alcoholic how many times You' been around like a do have you ever heard of Alcoholics feelings we you say to them hey you're an alcoholic and you see that look in their face where they recognize that you're telling the truth yeah then it really hurts yeah they get mad at you yeah yeah dude I I like the alcoholic outrage is one of the most like desperately sad things to witness there's nothing worse than a drunk whose feelings are hurt because usually their feelings are hurt because because you told the truth too yeah yeah they don't want the truth and so cuz their their condition depends on lies so well it's a weird um like one of the things about alcohol it's like it sort of Narrows reality yeah you know like if you think of one of the things that I really really enjoy about Edibles there's a thing that I enjoy when I get so paranoid and so freaked out that I don't think I'm going to make it and then I come down from that and I get to this place of humility and that's one of my favorite places to be as a person when I'm coming down from like a horrendous edible high and then all a sudden I'm like real thankful that it's over I just want to be friends with people yeah like there there's that space and it it it sort of bro like the world broadens your danger broadens your humility your Humanity your vulnerability broadens and then it comes back to a manageable level and you recognize that it could be so far worse than what you're experiencing currently and it's just your perspective that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] things up cuz right now with you and me right here no people have ever been more comfortable in the history of humanity no we're both in love we both have children we're both drunk and high we're both love each other we're both making each other laugh anybody in this position that looks at things incorrectly but like our our problem is always perspective our problem is always not recognizing how good we have it when we have it that's right dude this is like there's a Buddhist teacher Jack corfield who says tend to the part of the garden you can touch and also choim choe in one of his books one of the things he said was look it could he and he meant it it could be there's an ism that's good there's an ism that's the right way to be like it could be socialism communism who knows Capital he didn't say that but there could be an ism that works right because we we can't we can't accept the fact the isms of the past are the only ones that are ever going to be available that's crazy there might be a utopian ideal that is applicable to than now or just better but what he said what I love about what he said is it doesn't matter if you can't find peace in your own home yes if when you're in your own home there's disharmony if you're in your own home people are unhappy in your own home people are freaked out then why would you even think about socialism Capital capitalism or communism when the when the when the pixel of re of society is the house the household and if within that pixel there's division then of course in the world that division would be like made into some monstrous thing so well even down to the core to the singular you as a human who are you okay yes do you have your [\\xa0__\\xa0] together or no sometimes yes sometimes no sometimes yes sometimes no and everybody wants to point at people who don't go look at you you don't have your [\\xa0__\\xa0] together Duncan I know I know you got three qus of your [\\xa0__\\xa0] together that's not helping me get my [\\xa0__\\xa0] together that with your white privilege but I'm trying to be better I believe you but you must be punished I'm not sure for how long well that's aggression silence I want Silence from you for an extended period of time on the side give the further the silence the more you're going to appease people you can wait 10 years no one like four people be upset look man 10 months all like to me like it's like the whole that that whole ball of wax man is like dude like after once I started like the thing is like when all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] happened and as a comedian I was like really afraid to get into like even like a little bit of studying the [\\xa0__\\xa0] people are upset about cuz like no like comedian in their right mind wants to be identified with like some woke ass comedian because it's embarrassing but then when I started looking into it and then I found out about the George Washington [\\xa0__\\xa0] the George Washington [\\xa0__\\xa0] is super creepy creepy because there's no way if those teeth were valuable that people weren't murdered for their teeth that's it like there's no way people weren't like just held down and they got their teeth stolen or they were told that they were going to get money and they weren't and they were many of them were have been raped but here's the thing is there real value in getting outraged at [\\xa0__\\xa0] that happened hundreds of years ago or is it is it a an acknowledgment of first of all the fact that we all agree we do better that's what the turmoil the turmoil exists all of it social economic the turmoil exists because we haven't really come to grips with whether or not we can all get together and be cool with each other all the time yeah so there's always some sort of turmoil and when you look at turmoil in terms of like whether it's Financial turmoil or social turmoil we're always trying to figure out like who's being the [\\xa0__\\xa0] right don't you feel like that like when you what do you mean when you see anything that's happening like when you see um when when when you when you see uh a government getting overthrown when you see War you always like who is being the [\\xa0__\\xa0] any kind of turmoil you mean you try to find the perpetrator of the difficulty right what's causing it and is it possible that most of this [\\xa0__\\xa0] could be avoided and what's stopping most of it from being avoided when you look at any kind of any kind of government like any kind of country in invade anytime a country invades another country anytime bombs are being dropped from drones like what can be done to avoid this that's right what can be done dude I man I I started this [\\xa0__\\xa0] pandemic philosophy Club is what we call it with like my friends Marcus and Brandon what's up we don't even do a podcast every Friday we just get together and talk and uh they like midnight gospel that's how I got lucky enough to meet them Midnight gospel is an amazing show dude can I just say before we get going I'm really proud of you really really proud of you cuz it represents you as an artist more than like almost anything any of my friends who've ever done has done cuz you're so weird and it's so weird but it's so funny and it's so amazing it's amazing they let us make it I can't believe they let us make it praise Odin for Netflix praise Odin praise Odin but what they've done is amazing but what you've done is somehow or another encapsulate what some of the things I love about you how weird you are how uh you're not like anybody else when you came here today one of the things I said to you I go dude I go you're the only guy that like I like listening to your ads that's sweet Joe I do thanks your [\\xa0__\\xa0] expressvpn ad is a hilarious ad it took so long I didn't even know if it was an ad just some crazy but you're the best I you you are the the best that I've ever seen at reading ads out of all the people that I've ever heard who read ads your ads are the most entertaining you're very sweet Joe and I'm not going to get in a a [\\xa0__\\xa0] competition with you but I wouldn't be here if not for you and that's the truth and I'll never stop saying it and I will never stop being grateful to you for but I wouldn't I wouldn't be me if it wasn't for my friendship with you either swe it's true it's appr we all benefit each other from yeah but I'm I don't mean to cut you off I'm so sorry by the way I had a a little bit of boost so forgive my like impetuousness that I would like suddenly interrupt you but you do have a history of finding like young comedians who are like and you do like help us a lot and we are eternally grateful to you and I don't care if you don't acknowledge it you won't acknowledge it because if you did you're afraid you'll go crazy it's not that I want I'll I'll tell you from my perspective it's not that I'll go crazy it's that I have to do it there's no ifans or butts it's a path it's like if you're going down if you're on a [\\xa0__\\xa0] uh one one of those uh water slides and you're going flying down you're just going that way if you're a good person and you love and you love Comedians and you have friends and you want to see them happy and you want to see them successful and you know they're good and you know it benefits not just them but you to elevate them I'm like hey check out Annie Letterman hey check out everybody whoever it is it's like I want them to know that my relationship with them anybody who's listening to this podcast or anybody listens to my standup or watches it it's genuine that's who I am so if I find someone who's awesome I want you know about it I don't want to get paid for it if I find a great band I start talking about it on Instagram I find a great application I tell people it's cool I have the obligation this I didn't know if I did or but I didn't I don't I don't think I'm in a position that everybody's in it's a weird spot and might I say I'm so glad that Annie Letterman is someone that you your attention is she is so funny she's so funny her podcast is so [\\xa0__\\xa0] funny I'm sure it is but dude her and Whitney dude this is what happened we were at The Comedy Store the other night Mike binder Mike binder is doing his uh his whole uh uh Showtime documentary thing so we're all on the roof it was fun man I got to chat with Paul Rodriguez very cool dude I've really never got a lot of time spending uh talking to Paul rodrig before he's really cool man he's really he had some good good uh good stories about uh South America and Latin America and Mexico where comedians who actually got jailed yeah really interesting [\\xa0__\\xa0] and Bill bur was hilarious and Annie Letterman was on fire and then there was Whitney Cummings and Jay Leno and we had a good [\\xa0__\\xa0] time man it was a real and Mike binder it was a really good [\\xa0__\\xa0] time it really was it was um it was it first of all it reminded me how much I love that place like I walked in there I was like God damn I got so emotional when I walked through the door but when I had Whitney and Annie together and they're talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] to each other I'm like these girls are so funny and they love each other they're really good friends and and and I said Whitney was scheduled to be on the podcast and then I said to her I said do you care if Annie comes I want Annie to come but it's up to you she's like [\\xa0__\\xa0] Yeah so I brought Annie in too and the two of them together dude they're Savages that's that's the future of female comedy and the future of podcasting because there's all these like like that's a popular thing now like guys we [\\xa0__\\xa0] they they're killing it and then there's the call her daddy that CHS killing it like they're on a different vibration than you Duncan Trussell but there a really popular sort of segment yeah and these two girls together two hilarious standup Comics talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] together on a podcast I'm like you guys have to do it but they're also like you got to admit like they're Gonzo like the Hunter Thompson thing like they're full Gonzo both of them are like terrifying in their own way like you know what I mean like when you encounter either of them I have to help them right you have to have to help them do a podcast it has to be Annie and Whitney because the A's make you find it quicker the world deserves it but like I remember going to do any when I to be Annie and Whitney when I went to do Annie Letterman's podcast I won't give anything away any what happened I'm not I can't say it on it's not legal but like I remember like leaving there being like wow holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] like I remember leaving there just thinking like H not just that not whatever I'm saying right now I'm saying like realizing like I I've always loved chatting with Annie letan we have great conversations but I remember like getting into her where she lived and looking around and realizing like well she's formed some kind of cult I don't know what it is she's really funny man she's so funny and and like that like just that moment of like wow like you're you're like both of them well that it's the thing is is like like this uh acknowledgement first of all you your your podcast has a cult following and you've hit this like weird place and I think you feel very similar to the way I do that when you find someone who's extraordinary you want to let everybody else know exact we we both have that we all of us have that Joey has that Ari has that Ari is one of the be if you're AR's friend and you have a special coming out Ari will promote the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of you he's amazing at that he did it for Joe list he's done it for Mark Norman he's helped get guys on my podcast and I blow them up because if you're friends with r you're friends with me but we're all like that Diaz red band's like that Tony hinch Cliff's like that everybody will tell you all the people around them that are killing it and I think that's real important man I think it's an important thing to get out there there's a there's a frequency there's a frequency that we're all sending out and it's a frequency of camaraderie you know of uh it doesn't matter if you're wrong sometimes s or just like sometimes you [\\xa0__\\xa0] up like we're all like trying to go the right direction you know when we're talking about that dumb sperm that clashes heads with the alpha sperm and just accidentally slides in that [\\xa0__\\xa0] is going to happen that's right all these things are going to but we we have to move forward in the spirit of camaraderie and this is like the big test let's can we for a second just draw I don't care it's so cheesy and everyone you've heard everyone's heard you talk about the C store let's just spit a second go with The Comedy Store man because like for me and this is the truth and like you know I was talking to Ari he's like you never I'm like I I was going up like twice a week but even if I wasn't he said you never went no for a second cuz he did you worked there dude that's how we became friends I know but from Ari saw me in a really dark period where I was like not showing up for spots and he rightfully judges me for that but like it's okay I get was that when you were living with me that was after I was living with you I went through a dark period I didn't take I took it for GR granted and I deserve no but I whatever is dunin you just always been complicated that's it's not it's not you're complicated you know I was having a conversation with someone and they were saying like uh it's okay to have a loose chassis but you got to stay on the road yeah I I try to stay on the road man but I love The Comedy Store I love it with all my heart dude when when you and I became friends we should tell people you and I became friends cuz I would call into the comedy store and I say hey I'm here uh Thursday Friday and Saturday and you be like cool man hey did you [\\xa0__\\xa0] see this thing that they're saying is happening in Nepal where all these people are getting together and they're all seeing these like we' have these crazy conversations that go for hours You' you You' put me on hold you would take another call and then we would talk about [\\xa0__\\xa0] Terrence McKenna and Graham Hancock the best dude we had we would get baked on the phone where Duncan Trussell was a comedy store employee and I was I was at home and and we would get high and we would just start talking about aliens it was the best it was the best man that place is a temple for real dude but you and I became pen like phone Pals we but that's how we got to be friends and like here we are right now the funny thing is the conversation we're having is no different than the conversation we had when I was working there but I was saying to Jamie when you left and went to pee the the people bring things out of people and it's something that I don't think people like to admit but sometimes people bring bad things out of people and sometimes people bring good things out of people and when I'm with you I'm different than when I'm not with you yeah man I don't like I I really don't want this conversation to end like I'm not going to get all sapience in the you fly to Austin occasionally I'll fly any you want man I'll come I'll come anytime you want but like it won't to me it's like this is my solution to all this I'm just going to fly people out and put them up and pay for their food it'll be great get them massages it'll be great man but like all that being said like we just I just don't I don't think anyone can understand what it's like unless they've been there to get off stage at The Comedy Store and you have a good set maybe but you're working on a joke and you get off stage and suddenly Whitney Cummings who's like a very rightfully successful brilliantly funny person stops you and says hey what do you think about this addition to your punchline you know what I mean like those moments are so so like so like cuz CU in that moment there isn't like a hierarchy like in that moment there isn't like look I made like shows for Network TV Dude one of my proudest moments as a comic I was at the Improv and this was like 200 [\\xa0__\\xa0] three or some [\\xa0__\\xa0] like that and uh Louis CK sits in the back of the room and takes notes and then we get off stage and he actually asked me before he goes do you mind if I watch and like give you some like like give you some notes I dude I'd [\\xa0__\\xa0] love that yeah and then afterwards he had a bunch of really funny suggest questions I don't remember if I wind up using any of them but it was just so fun so fun to hear him and I talk about like bits and the fact that he would like sit down and watch these bits that's it that was the that's the so to me like you know and I like I would always tell Aaron my my wife I would always say like you know there's no Comedy Store anywhere else like I I want to go I want to be here I don't think it's impossible to make that somewhere else this is the whole reason why I'm interested in moving to Texas I don't believe that we have to be Tethered to this machine that makes things that we don't do right this machine makes music this machine makes movies and it makes TV shows and we don't do any of those things we're in a totally different business and I don't think we have to be connected to any sort of Legacy entertainment structure it doesn't make any sense and it's they just trying to siphon money off of you right it's just like they they're not they're missing the point like I want to tell the truth I don't want to just sell things I want I want I want to say what I'm thinking right now whether it's good or bad or angry or sad or remorseful I want to be able to say it anytime I want to say it and this is not acceptable in the the the the regular old school Legacy medium that that that people are thinking of as as mainstream media and it was mainstream media like 20 years ago or 30 years ago but what we're you and I are doing right now is writing on a [\\xa0__\\xa0] cave wall compared to what's coming what you and I are doing right now compared to what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is going to happen when Elon Musk starts producing this whole neural link yeah and then they they they develop some sort of [\\xa0__\\xa0] uh satellite Network where everyone's connected and reading each other's minds all over the globe dude this is cave wall scratch tickets [\\xa0__\\xa0] I know and to me we playing ticktock toe by the fire but this is what's this is to me like the poignant thing about like Neolithic structures is like you see the Neolithic structure and you know like [\\xa0__\\xa0] man people spent a long time building that and in this in the process of building that they became friends and they shared stories and it was really beautiful but now all we see is some old eroded [\\xa0__\\xa0] that we don't know anything about right yeah so to me what's beautiful is like you are absolutely right this thing we're doing right now it's it doesn't matter if like what we're doing is like moris code it's going to be go it doesn't matter if it's a million years but it won't be a million years it be it won't be that long before our conversation seem dated but you know what we're doing also we're doing the same thing that Beethoven was doing where they were making music at a time where you couldn't record it so you had to write it down yeah we're doing this some clunky ver like if you could listen imagine if you could listen to the actual orchestra that was playing like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony sh that's crazy you imagine bro also being in context never having heard the doors never having heard hendri people cough yeah right never having heard any of that only being in that era wow and sitting in the audience be crazy is that b toan's fifth did I make that up Jamie act like no no I don't terrible impression it was like who am I but think of how power being there in the moment when it was first released yeah and no one could record anything and now you had write it you had to write it down in some weird they had to develop a language for music say what it was yeah I mean you could be a badass guitarist in 2020 and not have any idea how to read music yeah that's right right that's right you could like watch videos and just decide I'm just going to go full Stevie Rance some people don't want to know yeah they want to be able to just free oh what's the earliest recording of that is this hooked on can you play that or we get in trouble see what Happ you can't play it that is it that's it right that's be toan's fifth I mean bro imagine being alive back then when you never heard any [\\xa0__\\xa0] like that dude I was sitting in the audience do you remember when Notorious BIG IG big big IG biggie you remember when Biggie came out with hypnotized no do you remember how old were you I don't know the year I don't know hypnotized seems like 95 because I was on uh I was on news radio and uh I remember driving to work what year 97 97 yeah so okay I was on news radio from 94 to 99 so I was on news radio and I remember driving to work and hearing that going whoa they just crack through some new level yeah biggy biggy Biggie can't you see sometimes your words they hypnotize me great song oh my God but it was just there was something about it where I was like oh somebody figured out a new level of the video game yeah they SP a ton of money on of course you did dude you don't understand what it was like back then no internet you would see him on MTV with piles of cash there was no account ility that's so cool like this is the like one like there's a a a concept in Buddhism which is like if you want to really has even started yet that's all just helicopters and [\\xa0__\\xa0] how many helicopters do you need look at him look at him biggy man do you know how many [\\xa0__\\xa0] amazing songs we missed out on because Biggie and Tupac didn't get together and smoke pot how [\\xa0__\\xa0] that have a couple of drinks like somebody had them tricked that they were enemies imagine if Biggie and Tupac was just like me and Stan hope or Like Comics Like Comics who just like like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are we we we should love each other we're the only ones that are like how many goddamn MC's are there how many rappers are there how many stand-ups are there there's so few we should be so happy we run it we can't that's that kind of talk will get you killed because that's the last Bastion of the thing that wants to keep us limited man it's like that's the idea is like but even them man I'm telling you for them they need to listen up I know you want to have control but sometimes not having control is better like here's the thing in archery let me tell you something about archery there's a thing about archery where it's very few people can what they call command shoot what that means is when you draw back the bow and you have your finger on the trigger you just decide when the arrow is going to go okay sure most people don't do it that way and most people who do these big tournaments like even the Olympics they teach them to have a surprise release it's a psychological trick where you're using a certain type of release where either you have your finger on a trigger and you don't push your finger you just let your back muscles pull it because they're crude muscles or you use what's called a hinge you slowly pull in the hinge and the the arrow goes but you don't know when it's going to go whereas a trigger you know exactly where it's going to go but there's something about knowing exactly where it's going to go where you just [\\xa0__\\xa0] you tense up you twitch and it's hard it's hard you just goally if you're in a tournament you're in the Olympics medal round so very few people in the Olympics allow their brain to decide when the shot goes isn't that interesting yeah yeah that's beautiful I get what you're saying too there there's a the mind of no mind the the ability to get out of your own way and for Archers the best way to do this is either in the hinge release or a release with a thumb where you pull through with your back muscles and it makes the the thumb trigger go off so cool this thing is dangerous this thing's dangerous cuz you could be develop what's called Target panic and there's people that never like my friend cam Haynes he's a freak of nature he's never developed Target panic and he shoots like this he sees things he shoots at them and he's perfect he shoot 140 yards Boop pop balloons and [\\xa0__\\xa0] but he also runs a marathon a day he's like a freak of nature he's a very rare human but you can't Bank it on those people you got to think about the rest of the folks for the rest of the folks the whole idea is like getting rid of anxiety and what's anxiety anxiety is pulling a trigger if you're in a gold medal round I just hit that bull side this is it America wins and you just Flinch there's just a little a little thing that happens to you that you don't want to happen and your arrow just goes 4 in shy mark it [\\xa0__\\xa0] love it yeah that's the so that is the so like and I'm sorry every every podcast I do with you I talk about Buddhism but I don't care I want you to talk about Buddhism thank you so like what I love about it is like so everybody gets caught up in the first two ideas and Buddhism the first being life is unsatisfactory the second being the reason life is unsatisfactory is because you think it's a way that is not now this gets translated in a lot of let's break that down life is unsatisfactory and the reason you think life is unsatisfactory is because well life so the the best way to put it would be have you ever been with someone in traffic in LA and they're angry me okay but when have you ever myself right but that's literally the way traffic is in La yes yet somehow like because you drove that day into traffic you got into your head this would be the one day in La where there wouldn't be traffic no honestly I keep it together but I do I do I recognize that it's knocking on the door it's like come on be a [\\xa0__\\xa0] freak out yeah I really do keep it together but that this is also the real argument for micro doing because if you could just micro do there would be so much less negative interactions with people whether it's on the highway or anywhere no one's going to no one who's micro doing on siloc cybin is going to yell at you from across the street put your [\\xa0__\\xa0] mask on no they're not going to do that you're going to let them be themselves but I want to be I want to be the person that makes people smile I I don't want to be the person that makes people mad I don't either and and this is something I'm like consciously thinking about more and more as I get older I I want I want us to do better I like really do this is one of the reasons why I have this idea of like starting over in Texas I have this idea of like this connecting from all these old hubs and this idea of what we're doing when we're putting out content into the world I don't believe it I don't believe it has to be from a media center I don't believe it has to be from New York or La I don't believe it and I I think I want to prove to myself that it doesn't have to I want to go one of the reasons why I wanted to go to Texas is cuz it's like almost like there's a there's a certain mockery to live in in Texas you know listen especially for someone like me I wouldn't want to be you like you you you everything you do is too study didn't and like I like like I like being free of that magnifying lens but you know to me like whenever I'm thinking about uh like you know it's fun to think about what's the root problem here the root problem seems to be centralization it's like wherever centralization rears its head problems emerge the root problem is compassion what do you mean the root problem is compassion that we don't make our decisions based on compassion we make them based on beneficial markers of improvement whether it's Financial Improvement or land grabs or that's the problem the problem is that we we we have these things in our head where this is what's the most most important and this is what's not as important like love is important but if you see two people that are you know they're in love but you don't like either one of them you do you feel like that's the same kind of love as two people you admire that're together yeah right like how many people who do you know like all right I'll give you one I do lared Hamilton and Gabrielle ree I'm friends with those two people they're super athletes she was a super athlete in volleyball and he's like one of the the greatest big wave surf the world's ever known I'm friends with them and when I talk to them if I talk to them either on like we do a little fa we do a little FaceTime the other day and and I get out of it I go that I want to be somebody who makes me feel or or I want to be somebody who makes somebody feel the way I feel when I talk to them that's cool when I talk to those people I'm like these are superior people like lared Hamilton's a weird dude but he's also like a superior human Who does these crazy pool workouts with like 70 lb dumbbells he gets in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] sa at 250° and rides an aird bike with oven Ms on Jesus yeah they're freaks he wears oven mitts cuz it burns his hand yes 250 250 you eat at some point he was like I got to put on oven mitts but he doesn't get out of soda and I I said to myself when I got off the phone with them the other day um they're really nice people they're really really they're genuine people and this is one of the things that happens and it's a weird thing that happens when you become uh more and more famous you get more and more comfortable talking to other famous people you know see talk talk to famous people and you realize oh they have a hard time talking to people because other people think they're weird yeah so they have to find famous people that are also nice right and so that's how I feel about them so I get off the phone with them and I'm like like you can be you could be Gabriella AR and you can be lared Hamilton and still come out and be a really cool friendly inspirational genuine person I'm like I want to make somebody else feel the way those people make me feel yeah man and that's what I felt like I love that that's the best thing we can do for each other that's the answer and that's like if if anything has ever coming out of this podcast that's been good it's that it's given people a perspective where there's a potential where that maybe they're limited ideas of what they're capable of in terms of their own personal happiness or their own success and whatever their chosen Endeavor is maybe it's not really limited maybe they can just shift their Consciousness and through effort and focus they can change their Destiny maybe it's true well you know the reason I say centralization is because like the first a very natural reaction to being associated with a body would be that you would centralize on the identity that you're in you know if I step on your if I stomp on your foot you're going to feel pain so why wouldn't you centralize on this identity that you're in so and again like right now with the science we have it can't show us what I think it will eventually show that our sentience isn't limited the to the body that we're a field of Consciousness that's kind of getting associated with like particular like Quantum clouds of meat that we and they interface with other sensient bodies in a way that makes them unique to the relationship between that person like I bet you're different with your wife than you are with anybody you've ever met well that that is true and yes but that's also like one of the great like right now one of the big Ideas it's such a cool idea too is like on stage offstage so uh how are you acting when you think you're on stage in other words like when you're in front of like this is the best part about Co there's no on stage anymore exactly that's it but it's the only good thing about Co for me well there there's a actually I'll tell you some other great things about Co it taught us out that we can tell a commutant businesses still work and that CH transforms the landscape but like the the the onstage offstage idea or or the way like choim chime puts it is some people at the end of the day they go home and they sit on the couch and they go and but they only let themselves do that at the very end of the the day of work because they've produced in their mind a situation where this is me relaxing and this is me working right here I am with my family here I am with my co-workers here I so this differentiation produces a kind of neurotic kind of uh like split personality uh way of being which is like really all those you don't need to wait to get home to sit on the couch to go that's where you're at now like that's actually every single thing but the story you're telling yourself produces moments where this is a relaxing time and this is a non-relaxing time but it's just a story Joe that that's the idea and like compassion is like I think the the beginning of recognizing like you know how many people have you met I'm sure and I know my life changed when I went to the doctor with my swollen [\\xa0__\\xa0] testicle that by the way before I went to the doctor I would look at myself in the mirror and think man if there were symmetrical I would feel awesome like it felt good to have a big ball there was like I literally was like God damn it if they were you were happy about the one big ball it looked powerful I'm not going to lie man have you ever seen Joey Diaz's balls yeah like that like the way Preposterous he feels like that every day they don't even make sense so like for a few months I Jamie have you seen Joey's balls see if you can pull up the picture of Joey on stage where he's naked with a with a uh he had a um can't show I know I know but just for me he had a uh a safety pin and a towel around his neck like a cape and this is for my 1999 Warner brother's CD called I'm going to be dead someday we took these crazy pictures in the main room at The Comedy Store dude I was there you were there for those The Matador outfit I was like there was some drama about it that you guys snuck in and took the pictures were you working you work was a talent coordinator you guys snuck in took the pictures you didn't no we didn't snuck in we had a we talked to whoever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] it was was it was it Scot day or tomm I'm sorry I feel like I was there when I happed I could be wrong but I remember the Matador pictures Warner Brothers did it maybe I'm wrong made calls no I remember thead door picture was real I'm sorry but I remember a moment that I was I think I was a talent coordinator where suddenly Joey there's pictures of Joey Diaz in a matador outfit they the funniest thing you ever seen But mity caught wind of it that's what I remember is there was some drama around the situation like the pictures themselves were like not just funny they were like kind of artistic they look cool there's a picture of Joey and he please someone find this it's in I think I have the CD so I have it if it's on the C it's on the CD so I have it cuz I I you know when I'm moving I'm going through my [\\xa0__\\xa0] and one of the things I found is those old uh I'm going to be dead someday CDs that's 99 I became Joey Diaz uh associate and best friend around 96 that's when I metad at him so like could that when I was there I just remember there was some drama no you might have been there if you were there in 99 I I you start working I don't remember I don't remember the exact day and again like I don't remember I just remember there was some drama around I think it was before your time man I want to feel like it's before your time dude it could easily be that mity caught wind of the pictures late or something you know it like it could easily I just remember there was some drama attached to the that lady was so nice to me she loved you man she loved Joey too she Lov both of us she had the the the the funnest thing with like her idea of us together she loved that we were together that we were friends she she was a wild she was a wild lady she was wild dude that was a real Guru like MIT Shore was an actual Guru yeah listen man I I tell everybody if there's one human being that's the most important human being in comedy ever that wasn't a comedian it's MSY Shore that's why she's on the wall of this room she was a I'm taking her with me man not only that the movers don't take her I take her M mi's coming with me on the plane yeah man she was real listen that's coming with me on the plane no [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah like the reason why that's up on the wall after the movers have gone is that's coming with me that's mity yeah she gave me my my future no she was wild she was a wild she was a crazy lady she's a perfect person to run The Comedy Store well no she had to be that way you know you could you can't make you can't have the if you go through there's photos in the album where you can see Joey with his uh with a cape he had this uh I oh godamn I know I can I know I have it I know I have it somewhere I'll find it it's on one of my folders you know what was in her when you walk into her house Joey Diaz Cape balls looking you know you know what was in her house on dhini when you walk into her house that so on her house when you walk in the first thing you see is what do you call it when people sew and they make art with sew crochet a crocheted picture and on it it said dying is easy comedy is hard that's the first thing you said eyes are yeah yeah and it like and it's true and like that that was what beautiful about her is she understood how hard comedy was I told you the story of her getting robbed right I told you that story which story is that tell me so like here's how cool she was and I I can't remember the name of the comic but she was giving him spots I can't remember the name of the comic this was in the early when it's better you don't tell it's better I don't say so this [\\xa0__\\xa0] needed money and he robbed the van she was in the van like apparently she he he like at gunpoint took the cash earnings of the of the club at gunpoint like took the money from her and she knew who it was somehow she could tell somehow from The Mask he didn't do good she just knew right and I remember her saying like yeah he uh he robbed me at gunpoint but he's funny but he's funny he that was her but that was her like can you imag like if you really think about it you get robbed at gunpoint by a comedian and you still give him stage time what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is that well that's a that's a guru that's a guru that's not a h that's not a normal person anymore that becomes like that I I've never had that sort of an relationship with any human ever you know I I sought her out when I was living in Boston really yes you knew about her dude when I was an open micer okay I had gotten obsessed with comedy for 6 months before I could ever do it open mic night cuz I erroneously assumed that you had to be 21 to be able to get on stage it turns out you can be younger but you just can't drink they watch you but you can be a 19-year-old do stand up I didn't know so August 27th 1988 when I turned 21 I went on stage and when when I went on stage I remember thinking I remember like really clearly thinking like how weird is this job there's a there's a bunch of people out there that can just talk and they can make a living yeah how weird is this job what did you think the first time you ever went on stage and you talked into a microphone hello hi my name is Duncan Trussell so weird like when you look back at those times like how do you feel you feel like it's not even you I met that lady when I met Mitsy Shore and when NY Shore passed me at The Comedy Store I remember thinking when I was in 1988 in Boston that there was this Mecca there was this place you had to go where Richard Pryor filmed live at the sunset trip and Sam Kennison used to stand up yeah and [\\xa0__\\xa0] hoe Mandel went up and Rodney Dangerfield and David Letterman godamn I got to get to The Comedy Store that's all they wanted to do I didn't want to get anywhere else there was one part of me that wanted to go to Houston cuz I had heard that like Sam kenneson did these wild shows in Houston I want to go to Houston but the the big thing for me was I got to get to the store and when I got passed by that lady dude you know it's one of the reasons why I feel so compelled to help people on this podcast it's cuz I feel like when that lady passed me I was like holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] like I'm a real comedian now like I don't have to be scared I just have to keep working I I got pasted yeah by the Godmother the real godmother yeah and like you worked for that lady that's right you were there all the time man I know can't go back she she made us she she created an environment that accelerated comedy yeah man she pushed comedy cuz she kept it together but like at the [\\xa0__\\xa0] highest RP like a 9,000 RPMs of the engines going she kept it together she let these Comics be wild remember you remember when Ari slapped Bobby Lee of course I remember do you know that's when he started getting spots is that true yeah you know how I know cuz I was jealous I was a talent Ari like like I remember Ari's gradually unraveling into his comedic self and like I remember like Ari smacks Bobby Lee I don't remember there's a fight between Ari and Bobby Lee and I remember as the talent coordinator that was when Mitzy start he's now a comic somewhere in that like in that like throwing off of rationality and that I don't know what it was man like in you know you the here's the most important part of mity she was a woman she was a woman and she encouraged chaos she wasn't in remotely concerned with safety she wanted wild people man she wanted dude she wanted me to be wild that's what she wanted she wanted wild comedy she wanted Kennison she wanted prior she wanted everyone that came in between Damon way yeah man she wanted she wanted wild she wanted Martin Lawrence she wanted wild she yeah she wasn't domestic MIT she was feral mity was a feral lady Mitzy was a human I mean that what we call human now people think of as pharoh or what people no I mean I mean but when I say pharoh I mean exceptional she was wild she didn't have anybody else's rules holding her back no she didn't and she didn't [\\xa0__\\xa0] care she didn't care she didn't care about money she [\\xa0__\\xa0] you that's the most important thing about her is like having a club on the Sunset Strip and not making decisions based on money yeah cuz let me tell you man as a talent coordinator there were plenty of times where people wanted to film some [\\xa0__\\xa0] in the main room where they wanted to pay a lot of money and she' be like no get it no tell them the [\\xa0__\\xa0] well we should talk about that cuz that was like one of the things about that club was that like you could never film anything there no that was one of the most amazing things about Ari filming his special there it was a really cool thing he did it was also like an acknowledgement that the world had changed and that was one of the reasons why I was willing to come back it's cuz Ari filmed his [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah in the O well she would have I I really do believe she would have approved that avenge sure but somebody would have got involved they would have [\\xa0__\\xa0] it up she would have made him jump through some hoops it wouldn't have been that easy like she would have made him do some crazy and she's right here's the thing she's right you know I didn't I didn't cash any of my checks you probably know that oh I remember I don't like when I was working at the store I just wouldn't cash my checks and then at the they would go hey we have like all this money that you I just like can I donate it to the sound system you bought the sound system there I did that too but that was that was extra that was on top of that cuz the sound system was [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and then you bought it and honestly mity didn't want you to do that because like that was the thing like she re she was smart enough to know if I let a comedian buy the sound system I can't like honestly give them spots like so she I knew that was the case but I was like at this point she's giving me spots every [\\xa0__\\xa0] weekend I just want to help out let's not stop playing games like come on you know what I'm doing I'm out here doing my best stand up I can this we got a [\\xa0__\\xa0] up speaker system let's fix it I put I put a DAT system in there I put a mini disc and I wanted to have it set up so anybody could like if you had a mini disc remember the mini disc days of course dude it was so important before smartphones to be able to record your shows yeah it's so big and you don't record and listen to all of them but the option to be able to do that is so huge even if you're not diligent you still gain like 10 20 20% of like a tightening of your act dude The Comedy Store at that time for lack of a better word was an art cult yeah that's what it was it was a cult and like it was a cult that was like for sure ba like all cult systems are based on like a strong charismatic central leader it was mity but you know what as a man I was uh happy to relent to MSY well yeah thing but there was a thing for me as like this macho man it was important it was important to relent to mity you had to but it wasn't just that I had to I wanted to to show respect to show that I I got it to show that I know what you did yeah man like that lady man when I was in [\\xa0__\\xa0] Boston in ' 88 I would hear about her she loved comedy one lady did this like yeah she was married to a comedian but it didn't work out and she's paully Shore's mom and I would hear these stories and I'd be like that's crazy this one lady just figured it out and she was wild and she liked the party and she like man and she was just a wild lady but she was brutal with you she didn't like your comedy she would just tell you you were done she would just tell you if she thought you weren't funny you were done dude she put her hand on my wrist she goes you're really funny and I'll never forget that it was like 1994 I was like oh my god well she wouldn't hand that out lightly man that was the thing is like she was like that I've been around it like so it's so weird I I'm so lucky because I got to be around like Romos and Mitsy Shore and like they're similar in a way man yes they are similar yeah the there's a there's a lot of difference don't like this idea of what we think of as perspect perspective yeah dude 1994 when I was six years into comedy her putting her hand on my wrist and telling me I'm really funny changed my life look the to me the thing that like will never be captured is that it's not just that here you have this like tiny woman who is tiny tiny but it's not just that you have this being I would be so careful when I would hug her right remember hugging mity yeah yeah well she was a gangster I mean that was all like the thing about mity was like no like imagine like the the best thing to think of is like think of your most like Outlaw comedian then imagine a person who built a saloon within which those comedians could be grown to be more of an outlaw there was no Kennison without MSY Shore that's right but then the most to me like with mity if you were G and she would never allow this she'd already if she heard me saying any of this [\\xa0__\\xa0] she'd be like get fired but like if you were going to write a mity Bible that and you wanted to like base the whole Bible on one thing it was something she told me so many times as a talent coordinator and I liked to in fantasize she thought I was funny but as a talent coordinator something she told me over and over and over again regarding comedians was you don't need them they need you that was her like core thing which is like the moment that a comedian starts thinking that they need the system then they degrade themselves they have to understand that their comedic ability and who they are as that Persona which she would say is like they're iconic class she meant like you're not going to find anyone like this ever again and that's who she was trying to find she would say therefore you it's supply and demand which is like there is nothing like you but there's a lot of things like them so if you think that you need them you will degrade yourself as an artist that was her main core truth which is don't get caught up in the thing they're going to try to teach you which is you need them you don't need the manager you don't need the agent you don't need the studio you don't need anything cuz you're are funny you're the [\\xa0__\\xa0] nuclear isotope generating energy and if you get lost in this Insanity that you require the system to be great not only do you grade yourself you to great in art but you know this is one of the things about recognizing what MIT Shore did and a lot of Bud fredman a lot of people who own clubs Rody Dangerfield yeah is it's not just about the ideas and getting the ideas out in a way the audience can Digest it's setting up a club it's bringing people in it's setting a standard where people know hey man David Letterman came out of here Robin Williams came out of here yeah okay Bill Hicks came out Bill Hicks was a [\\xa0__\\xa0] door man here Sam Kennison came out of here okay this is the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Comedy Store there's a standard and that's a factor too man you can't let the artists completely be in control because one charismatic artist with a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] song and dance moves can trick people into thinking things that aren't necessarily accurate because of Charisma that's true man like that's she figured that out though yeah and we need another one of her man I mean like the thing you're never going to get another mity but we we can carry on her Legacy we we we all learned from her you know and I think she was uniquely qualified to run the comedy store because she wasn't a comic she had no no desire to be a comic but she was married to a comic and she knew exactly what Comics were her son was a comic yeah she knew exactly what Comics were and she wasn't stupid she was smart and she was she but she also didn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] like there's a there's a rare group of people that legitimately don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] if Mitsy Shore was alive today if we could somehow or another like go back in time and grab Mitsy Shore from 1974 and bring her to 2020 she would she would just be running [\\xa0__\\xa0] she would just be running [\\xa0__\\xa0] first of all she would have like a hundred girls under contract for like only fans accounts she would just run people I'll tell you the one time that part that part's not true the only fans the only fans I it's conjecture but I'll tell you the one you have a problem with only fans the porn site it's not a porn site though it's like girls can do whatever they want I don't have a problem with sex like I like I have a problem with my own inability to like regulate my desire to come but like I can't get mad at the world for that like that's had a conversation with some with someone and they were saying well also she has an only fan site I'm like H if I had big tits I'd be like getting paid for those big tits I'm so tired of these sex negative [\\xa0__\\xa0] man they ramped up when the lockdown though cuz it became of course it should easy job for a lot of people if I was 22 and I had big tits and I like to do squats and I was sitting around thinking do I do I want to work at Burger King or do I want to shake my ass for 10 bucks a month for 35,000 guys yeah it doesn't have to just be that though either it's not just a porn St you can do whatever you it's patreon for you know this is madness so only fans you can just do yoga but Joe in like a dimension where like being funny is getting people to come you would be like the top porn star in that Dimension it just that's a weird one right like getting people to come is so specific that's what's a big deal it doesn't matter it shouldn't be a big deal but yet it is like if you find out that somebody came it's not a big deal it shouldn't be but it is it is right now cuz we're lunatics like we hate life like we're in a exactly yeah we're we're we're we're we're so death Centric that like the anything that's the source of life which is a hand job a blow job [\\xa0__\\xa0] we look at that as like being depraved you know well it's it's really just some sort of weird Canyon ladder in between two [\\xa0__\\xa0] Cliffs between this and what is going to be available for people in just a few years there's going to be virtual sex you got to have Riley Reed on man she's so great like I had her on my fck you have her on and I'll take my pants off what I'm going to do is I she's so funny goggles on this this is the future goggles you put goggles on you lay back you're in another world well yeah I mean that's heaven but like but is it yes no what's wrong with coming because there's 1% of your brain that knows it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] why there's no real girl and they don't really like you and your jokes suck and you kind of smell and you didn't brush your teeth that good yeah yeah but she's like I love part of you no the girl oh no no no no no if the girl really did love that part of you that would be extraordinary see that's the beauty of alcohol alcohol is you're hanging out with a girl who's got a like Hello Kitty tattoo in between your thumb and forefinger and you guys are drinking you're having a good time and you're like I love you and she's like I love you too and you just give each other a hug it doesn't even have to be sexual that's where alcohol comes in where where what do you mean what do you mean I'm following you in the the Hello Kitty the where does that alcohol come in that's where alcohol comes in and like it allows you to take chances and hope that the other person doesn't have ulterior motives where you both release your Ambitions and run let's go to Vegas and get married I don't even know you let's go crazy how crazy is that we think fucking's bad it's not that we think fucking's bad it's that we worry you [\\xa0__\\xa0] too many people you got tricked too many times you're like one of those people at one of those David bla Street shows and you're like it's got to be the queen of hearts trust me isn't that wild it's like it's the great it's one of the great things it really is one of the great things like think of like anytime like you know why why because we're concentrated more on Innovation and progress in terms of numbers like but earning money and uh getting new projects pass through they take precedent over every everything else so sick it's weird but it's just a it's a weird game this is what I'm getting out of this book irresistible it's like there's things that we have in our head where we're we're we have these they're wrong we have these ideas of what we need in order to be sufficient like here's we're operating from the wrong principles wait I'm sorry Joe I got a I've been holding for like 10 minutes I'm sorry I don't want it to end man we don't have to end go P this is the first show ever on Spotify I can't believe I get to be here I gotta go I I looked on your your go I wasn't even in the Jesus go PE no voting he's there's no voting God that isn't he funny I wasn't even in the voting Duncan Trussell I wanted you to be guest number number one it's important guess number two Miley Cyrus that's right second one number two yeah that's what I said number two I said guess number two yeah you don't even listen we're like an old married couple Jamie it sound I said guest number two I'm drunk I'm high guest number two is Miley Cyrus guest number three Mike mother [\\xa0__\\xa0] Tyson how about that Jamie are you concerned at all about moving to Texas no that's what I like about you it's one of many things but you're ready to roll like I should just tell the people at home I brought it up with Jamie I'm like I'm thinking about moving to Texas Jamie goes okay is that accurate yeah I mean that's gonna happen something was coming some change something was happen what did you think was going to happen what was worst case scenario like Montana I no I didn't think that was GNA no I don't know I just didn't want you to not want to do it I wasn't worried about it good I'm happy there's uh you know it's hard feel like I'm prolonging this out of an neuro longing anything this is fun Jamie and I just had a Love Fest oh that's great I do feel like I'm I was asking Jamie if there's ever a time where I was telling him we're moving to Texas where he was like oh like I don't want to do that but he's like no but when I brought it up I'm like do you what do you think and he's like okay like that's cool I do feel like I'm stretching it out it's like man it mean man this is the first episode on Spotify I I love it's supposed to be you it's supposed to be you it's beautiful but also there's a piece of me that I think we can work things out together I really do I think you and me together have a unique perspective and I'm not [\\xa0__\\xa0] I agree and I don't think it's I'm not taking ownership and you shouldn't either it's the the two of us together I know there's a weird thing that happens I feel it man like look it's my favorite thing which is why I don't want it to end which is why I'm like I like to like look man I'm a Bo I know I'm going to die what does that mean though when you say you're a a Buddhist shouldn't we have a new thing you said like communism socialism I love it Joe I love it can't we have a new one I think we can but I do want to like the reason I'm going to speak up for Buddhism in general and I agree with you and what I love about Buddhism so much is that man what's great about it is it invites you to reject it it says to you the first part of it is like reject this if you can like if you can find a flaw in the thing reject it and and also if you can find a like legitimate rejection then we will add that to the like what Buddhism it's of Buddhism yes so that's what I love about it because it's more of a process that's that's perfect yeah it's perfect and it has to be that way it has to be that way if you're thinking about how to progress with ideas yeah man you have to be able to say hey bring me a counter idea that makes more sense and I'll reconsider it but it's what we were talking about earlier people are married to their goddamn ideas it's sad it's it's it's not just sad it is sad for sure but it's also it's bad for all of us and it's it's one of those things that we should recognize just like you know like uh negative feedback like oh I'm so fat oh I'm such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] loser everybody admits that that is not good for you and it actually hinders process and I progress I think that it hinders progress as well I think we have to look at things in a more positive way that's so weird dude I like it I was there's this teacher Jack cornfield he's so smart he's a Buddhist teacher and I remember like in the early days of the ramdas Retreats I would do these podcasts with him and I remember being like I want to get in shape I feel like I'm fat and what he said to me was get in shape because you love yourself not because you hate yourself don't get in shape because because you are uh angry at who you are right now get in shape because you think you deserve to be in shape that's cute that sounds like gu never been fat listen to me [\\xa0__\\xa0] hey he's not a [\\xa0__\\xa0] competition's real [\\xa0__\\xa0] sometimes you just got to get in shape cuz you don't look at fat shaming works this what people don't like to admit that that shame makes you [\\xa0__\\xa0] lose weight cuz you don't want to feel bad and then you feel good because you lost all the weight I have to stick up for Jack cornfield because he is one of the great teachers I'll stick up for him too and you would love him and you would you would love I love him if he's friends with you I love him thank you Joe but I do have to stick up for him but just just like an example of how badass this person is do you want to move to Texas no I can't I'm going I I'm not saying are you sure I don't want to be local I have an idea I think you and I together can fix a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] what's the plan man you and me do like a weekly podcast one a week Joe and Duncan I love it live from Austin I love it but it's not going to happen in Austin why not oh we'll Zoom for a while until you come to your senses listen man we'll do it off camera this conversation I love this conversation though listen man I'm not bullshitting I'm not bullshitting I would do just about anything for you Joe I would do just about anything for you I know you would I would now look I got to stick up for this teacher though and I'm we can zoom it we can zoom it hold on what teacher Jack cornfield Joe bu guy yeah I love you man I love you too but you got to understand this is like a person has deeply impacted me and and like he was a monk and I know him as a friend and like he's a monk okay in the sense that he went here's what's cool about him he went to he became a monastic terab and Buddhist and he like took a vow of silence for like two years so for two years he didn't talk is it possible he didn't have anything good to say oh no no man Jack corfield look look listen I I really like he really like I'm sorry I don't mean to be sentimental about somebody joking I know you're joking when did he die he's alive Joe sorry sorry sorry you said sentimental I panicked I mean sentimental only in that like I wouldn't want to do anything that would like negatively impact like a real can we get him on a show first you me and Jack cornfield you would love it you how about that our first episode that convinces you to move to Austin Texas I would I would come to Austin Texas to Jack no what if I bought you a house would you live in it Joe I love that you would buy me a house but I wouldn't move is that it's cool about us like one of the cool things about us is you could say I will buy you a house that's not why I would want to be with you for the house or I know I know man and I understand but like for me it's like I will off camera I will talk to you about the reason we made the decision oh listen you made an amazing decision your decision is way better than mine but I don't I'm jealous I don't want be local like to me like I get it let's do a zoom show let's do a zoom show or let's you and I have known each other for so long we could do both or either exactly we could do Zoom shows we could do live shows I just think like the the right now the best thing for the world is not to imagine that you have to be in any given GPS coordinate I think that yeah the best thing for the world is to begin to realize like we don't need to be Tethered to a a a a particular locality like this is the problem is like it's it's a bit of the problem but it's also in recognizing that it is an actual like it's a thing that you factor into the world that you see but how relevant is it to day-to-day operations right that's what I'm talking about like that's the to me like the gift of Co has been like people have begun to realize like keep your circle small Google is doing fine and no one's going to Google to go to work Twitter is doing fine no one's going to the Twitter building to work Netflix are they do they have jobs dude people are all working remotely no one's going to Netflix Oh what you're saying is that the businesses are doing well but no one's going to the the actual business they don't have to why do they have to exactly dude that that to me that is the if you want to like start really like restructuring Society let's start with a Superstition that you need to be in in in like a like proximity of another person's body God damn that kills New York City yeah it kills La too it kills La it kills La that's why I want you to come to Austin dude I will be at whenever you want I'll come to Austin D no come bring your baby ah he would love I can't wait for you to meet little Forest he's so brilliant but but my point is look man my point is like we can't be centralized like look you're going to be in Austin I'm going to be in a certain place I don't want to say yet it's a bunker outside of Nevada somewhere near Baro where the bats take over we're going to fight against centralization so that we don't have to get chained to shitty cities like that's the whole point is like look if anything happens after Co that's beautiful it will be that all the commuters say to their bosses wait a minute for the last six months I've been zooming in for these [\\xa0__\\xa0] conferences and your business is doing just as well as it did when I was driving an hour to get there an hour back and then the moment that happens we break the back of addiction to being in a metropolis now we have a global Society now it's not just that you have to have some person who's like living in an Angelino it's like you could have someone from any part of the planet centralization seems to be the fundamental problem in the sense that it was it worked we needed to centralize prior to the internet but now we don't need to centralize no one it's better for everybody if we take into account every idea it's better for everybody if we take into account all the dumb ideas and smart ideas and let them battle it out yeah let's find out who's right yeah and you got to be real careful people who think that they're right and the other people are wrong it's what we were talking about earlier that bums me out the most about the Democratic Convention is it I would just like forget about whatever you don't like about Trump tell me what you're GNA do don't tell me how bad the orange man is tell me what you're going to do yeah how you going to fix it how you going to fix it yeah what are you going to do what are you going to do about Flint Michigan's water what are you going to do about the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Earth is heating up what are you going to do about there no fish where's the fish what are you going to do yeah nobody has an idea they just want to talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] and make sure everybody's trans I would rather them talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] and make sure everyone's trans then be like what's happening now which is I don't mean that trans people I'm with you I know look you're here's what's funny to me about your whole like push back against the trans Community it's not it's only push back against trans people competing as females and fighting that's it and other Athletics a little bit but fighting in a big way to me the part of it that's like interesting is I know you well enough to know that if and you prove me wrong here but if there was a technology they could turn a guy into a woman no they could not just turn a guy into a woman which is very funny because right now that's what we're doing and it makes sense because it's like right now what we know is men and women right so that's where we're at so right now as far as our understanding of what can a human be if you want to break it into a binary we've got men and women right but that's pretty limited to me you know what I me and I get wanting to be a woman and I think that you Joe Rogan if there was a technology that could instantly turn you into a woman yeah you wouldn't hesitate to turn i' like to feel a dick inside me yeah exactly that's what I'm saying me as a woman yeah and I don't think it made me gay no exactly doesn't make you gay trust me if someone who's felt many dicks inside of them doesn't make you I'm just kidding if you could be a woman and actually be attracted to a male for 18 hours and you're in love imagine a second imagine if you have an Oculus Rift and uh yeah they make you go through a bunch of waivers and they say Duncan um if you do take the next step signed what happens is you become a woman who actually feels the way a woman feels when she's attracted to a man a guy with a dick like a battering ram let me try he just going to send it home see what happens and you can't wait you want to feel him come inside your upper rib cavity like want to feel it sign me up yeah who cares the point is like you would do some men the weakest Among Us would be scared of that experience right they'd be scared that that experience weakens them and turns them into something that they they they dismiss but how hilarious is it that they sorry Joe no no it's it's their own issue no it's the the the experience that literally made them exist on the planet they feel like if they were to feel it it would be something against who they are which is insanity in the sense that the very see the very feeling of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] blowing come inside your body you switch spots with your woman imagine if the only way a woman was willing marry you is if you become the wife and she becomes the husband and you switch Consciousness it Duncan I love you I love you too Priscilla I want to know what it feels like to be you yeah I want to be with you yeah but I want I want to be you for four years yeah let's swap identities foure contract yeah we're all of your secrets get downloaded into your wife's brain let's swap he likes feet that's not a secret imagine though that no that's the idea is like the point is like right now we're like terrestrialization funny to me about like Lindsey Graham I love Lindsey Graham he's such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] but I I feel for I feel a weird connection to him he's such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] but like Lindsey Graham I have the feeling that if suddenly there was like the ability to travel through space he would leave the planet within seconds he would just be gone the lindsy gramy was like here's what I think about religious guy no he's a politician Lindsey Graham is this like like piggish is any religion he's like poor Lindsey grah man he's like he like got he has a weak chin I have a weak [\\xa0__\\xa0] chin man yeah D I shave my beard no listen bro that guy no Lindsey Graham look I know Lindsey Graham he like got sucked into a dark Vortex he's a sweetheart Underneath It All and also he's like he's like a gay dude you know he's like a gay dude who like has but what I'm saying is like what is he saying what he's a gay dude that has like a lindsy Graham causes problems because he a gay dude that what he like is a he's a he's a suppressive being that like is like aligns with closet no not a closeted thing it's not the gay dude is in the part the the it doesn't matter if Lindsey Graham's gay that's all what I'm saying you brought it up so it must matter no what I'm saying is like his [\\xa0__\\xa0] came out about him being gay and like then he had to fight it or like there was like some I felt bad for in that regard I feel bad about but don't you think for him even like it would be if he just said said I'm gay yeah be the best or I'm not like that's that's the argument against these two ideas if you could turn into a woman and get [\\xa0__\\xa0] like you just said would you be gay it's good question bro no you would just be a woman who got [\\xa0__\\xa0] but like somehow if like you're if you've decided to centralize on your masculine identity and someone [\\xa0__\\xa0] you now you're gay the whole like conceptualization of gayness and straightness it's just monkey talk is the problem the word itself the problem is a binary it's like the definition who like it's a trait it's a binary dude it's like look I don't know I like whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] it is that you think is like limiting your ability to experience pleasure on the earth is Satan and it's like if that thing is telling you that you're a dude and this is the only way you can feel Joy but on the like simultaneously you're like hanging out with a guy who's like the same gender as you and your fall in love with him and then you're you're pretending you're not because because like some devil voice in your mind is telling you that's Satan man that's evil that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] evil it's dark it's dark and I'm not like deriding Lindsey Graham's sexual proclivities I'm just saying you know he's not actively gay I don't know that all I'm saying is like when I why you shaming him I'm not shaming lindsy gr I feel like you are no I'm not I'm saying if I feel like it' be nice if you admit your privilege I hope Lindsey grandma is listening to this cuz I'm not insulting you my friend you could hear from my voice that I'm not insulting you I'm just saying H darkness my old no Joe I'm telling you if lindsy grah could fly off the planet he would that's what I think I would he fly off the planet with a man's mouth on his penis who wouldn't I would do that in a second I don't care who it is if that I don't care if it was what fueled the spaceship or didn't that would be amazing why wouldn't you do that who how awesome would that be imagine if it was the mountain from Game of Thrones that guy's blowing you as you fly through space and your orgasm extends to Eternity yeah the whole like gay straight thing really falls apart Pink Floyd I wish you were here s of Silence I was trying to work it in there but can't find the but you the gay stay thing falls apart if we stop being terrestrial like the moment you're not on the planet anymore it's all planetary based memes man it's like the moment we're like released from the gravity well all the stuff that seems so important to dumb asses which is like what you you [\\xa0__\\xa0] you would put your mouth on a penis you must be crazy imagine if it felt amazing imagine like man never blow a [\\xa0__\\xa0] guy and you get that dick in your mouth and the moment that sperm hits your tongue it's like Pop Rocks yeahp pop and your brain goes oh you and I man we will suckle on a we will suckle on a mucus thing that's like a like this vag we'll do that we pride we pride ourselves on it we pride our water park slide that's what I love so much about Christina Pit's Instagram she does these like [\\xa0__\\xa0] hilarious Tik Tock clips that she recovers from Tik Tock and there's a whole genre of Tik Tok of these creepy [\\xa0__\\xa0] perves who are like showing how they lick [\\xa0__\\xa0] and like the whole Tik Tok is based on them like going it's so [\\xa0__\\xa0] up but it's like a guy will in the masculine sense will go down on a girl yet the concept of having a dick in your mouth is considered to be like [\\xa0__\\xa0] up like you must be like a complete like you something about you is weak you know and I think we're going to have to contend with that as what's this uh that's the dude what's he doing he does like how like he like watch just you got to watch him man what he do I don't know I just I just checked her this guy does like like eating [\\xa0__\\xa0] Tik toks that's what he's doing yeah watch watch just watch this one doesn't do he like he like eases into it her by the way her Instagram the Tik Tok she does like she should do a whole show based on her like she she like curates the most [\\xa0__\\xa0] up Tik toks you've ever seen isn't that important like Tik Tok whether it's Tik Tock or Instagram or any of these things isn't that important just random one I do that it kind of is right it kind like lowering the boundaries like uh dropping down the boundaries for people to be able to enter into the world of expressing whatever weirdo idea they have or a video of them doing back flips onto a [\\xa0__\\xa0] whale whatever they're doing yeah yeah it's the B I I like I don't like Tik Tok in the sense that like my wife she's into Tik Tok and I don't like it because she's always looking at Tik Tok and then I'll be like really you're looking at Tik Tok and she'll be like you're on Twitter all day long you should get off Twitter you should read this book I hate Twitter this book irresistible it's a mindblower man it really is because it it lets you realize that as much as we're at each other's throats right now I don't know how much of it is our fault and I think we could have been a lot better off if someone decided instead of trying to make money that they would recognize that this uh strategy of uh whether it's social media likes or Twitter you know Twitter Twitter or Facebook or whether it's showing you the things you get angry about and you comment on on Facebook or YouTube like whatever we're doing like ultimately we're changing the path the way people think we're way more valuable than we like to think we are way more and I think people that have a voice whether it's you or I or Ari or bird or Tom or anybody who has a podcast in particular because if you have a podcast at the very least no one's telling you what you can't talk about no one's Duncan I I love that segment but when you're talking about people like not conforming and trying to figure themselves out people think you're nonbinary or somehow or another you're like you're like you're not woke sorry I'll repeat what I said I'm sorry I'll revise we're in the middle of a storm Duncan yeah well we what the main thing the most important thing I think in the storm and it's easy to forget is is that like you and I and everybody we run across I've yet to meet somebody who's a real monster man there's a few but even them they just need hug they're also very unique when you run across it's very unique and like the anytime I feel like this is where I'm like I'm attuned to this anytime I get the sense someone's wanting me not to express myself that's where I get really locked in and really like and I get the whole like anti-woke thing because nobody wants some [\\xa0__\\xa0] liberal Baptist piece of [\\xa0__\\xa0] to tell them how to be but you know man like the moment I'm on my Instagram I did a black lives matter thing that's the only time anybody told me to shut up no one told me to shut up before that but the moment I did a thing that was in alignment with like black lives matter there was all of a sudden like this weird similarity of people hitting me up being like you you [\\xa0__\\xa0] woke me there was a lot of of blowback from that and and also when when you say a lot like how many enough that like like I noticed it and right but if you tuned in at a hug part like 30 messages how many messages no not 30 just enough where I really 10 I'm going to say like five 15 15 enough where like I realize how many Instagram followers do you have I don't remember dude I can look it up right now like not 200,000 or something I a lot of people man no but but I know what you're saying but it was like I realized that like my thinking regarding being like even remotely an a political activist was being shaped by my fear that a tiny percentage of my audience would reject me and that's what I'm saying it's like I was letting my ship get steered not by my own Intuition or Not by my my own sense of like [\\xa0__\\xa0] man like that [\\xa0__\\xa0] George Floyd video that's unforgivable that just [\\xa0__\\xa0] up but you know it's it's it's both it's unforgivable any man that would do that to another man like that man needs help I I bet he didn't think he was going to kill that guy but he tortured that guy for 8 minutes and 46 seconds it's like that guy needs he needs uh he needs a DMT trip he needs something he needs to recognize who he is killer he it's also Duncan I think I think we're asking people to do things they're not really qualified to do they don't have the tools to handle it they don't have the infrastructure to handle the load of pressure that comes in I just feel like all these people that and then right now we're we're so anti- cop it's like it's over the top well look man what I love about you is that you're like not afraid to say a thing like that and like I think if we're going to go if we're going to move forward right now we need cops but no if we're going to move forward what what we need is not just cops we need passion like that that the what if we're going to move forward what we need is it's like look man you're you're right this country was completely founded on human trafficking you're right that uh your your idea that like the the way like uh if you're if you have a a particular complexion in this country [\\xa0__\\xa0] is immediately against you you're completely right about that you're right like the thing is is like this is the problem is like and I think this is an important question for everybody to ask themselves is how do you act when you're right that's how that's how you can really tell a person you know what I think honestly I think we are looking for change the way we see change in oursel like we see a potential for changing oursel we see something wrong we go I got to correct that and then we think that Society can do that too but Society is like a battleship it's like a 500 M long Steel struct structure that has [Applause] to planes land on it it it's yeah that's it that's it that's a good description it's got to turn so and then people like [\\xa0__\\xa0] you we don't like people from [\\xa0__\\xa0] muslim countries yeah right [\\xa0__\\xa0] you trans women are real women yeah right and it's this battle to try to like navigate this enormous metal structure through the [\\xa0__\\xa0] ocean right that's where we're at that's where we're at that's why you got to do a podcast with me Duncan anytime I'll do anything for you man got to work this out we can work it out I mean the answer Jamie I'm not wrong right no but the answer is compassion Joe lot ways to do it no this is what I'm thinking you and I have a very unique frequency yeah let's do it this is why it's important because when you and I get together and I I firmly believe you and I can do this every godamn week I love it especially if we only saw each other once a week it's the best I'll fly you in I'll F come to Austin once Zoom we can zoom we can do whatever I'll fly to North Carolina I'm not going there I'm going to Colorado baby I met chuba yeah man like I I love it Joe I I mean I to me like you know that's what I think so great about the fact that you got to be the person that you are that you got to be the the spotlight got to be on you as it is and the reason it's on you and the reason I take such I really like not much offends me man but when people start attacking you I do like I have to fight against my offense because I know you and so when people are [\\xa0__\\xa0] at Arms against you I feel really depressed because I know you and I and you like you are one of the most Progressive people I've ever met and so when you when people start falling upon you uh because you have like [\\xa0__\\xa0] nerds like Ben Shapiro which by the way you shouldn't have that guy anymore he's a d come on come on those conversations are important I think what's beautiful about what you're doing is you're opening I would not open up the the by the way Ben Shapiro Underneath It All I know that you and I would probably have fun but I know that right now where you're at in your Incarnation you're a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dork and the you know what I mean like he's a DK he's a d but what's so confusing nice guy but what that's what's confusing about him is cuz you you look at his like you look at him and you're like he's all like beating up what's her face about the thing and that embarrassing thing the the the music video he's like and they were doing fornication did you see me and Alli makovsky talking about wet ass [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh God like like that thing Shapiro's do it's so embarrassing Joe and like that dude is like an embarrassment but the what I I don't think what people admit when they look at Ben Shapiro it's like there's a piece of you that's like I I'd have fun with him like it' be fun to drink with him he's probably cool but he's like right now I don't think he drinks but he's a nice guy he's a what whatever it is he he's a good person I'm not bullshitting I look again I think our job right now is not to alienate we have to like involve and that's why I have him on that's that's why I know you're doing it Joe he's a I'm telling you right now Ben chapiro is a nice man he's a nice man I see him I hug him every time I see him and I don't hug him to be fake I hug him cuz I genuinely love that guy I think he's a nice guy look I think some of the stuff he's propagating and his like philosophies is like legitimately deranged bro he's wearing an outfit it's a costume he's got I mean he Ben shapir could never take off the yamaka shave his head tattoo his chest with an eagle right wear a bikini he's got an outfit I just want but it's not his fault I'm telling you we all come from a different spot we if if life is a race it's not like everybody's on the same starting line like people are on starting lines they're like a mile behind your they're so far away they're all different and they here's the thing even if people are wrong about many things or even I'll explain this better even if you disagree with the way people feel about so many different things it doesn't mean you can't be their friend it doesn't and I'm telling you we got it wrong sweet here's what's important what's important is whoever that person is they got to be sincere now as soon as you feel like someone's a grifter yeah you got to cast them out right you got to cast them out cuz they got to figure that out on their own and they got to apologize that's cool man you got listen you can be wrong but you have to be honest and if you're just bullshitting then I can't hang out with you dudey let me ask you Shapiro is not bullshitting I don't think he's bullshitting I just think he's like a little like Antiquated in his IDE look man I I like I'm not like the whole Ben shapir thing like that's of all your guests is the one he a great guy man if you met him if you and I and him went to a steak dinner we'd have a great conversation I I hung out with him at the um the what's that steakhous the bo boa boa in Hollywood down the store from the store on Sunset I had a great time with him he's a good man I don't care I I like genuinely like him a lot when he texts me benir texts me I look at my pH on my bench I like that guy I like him I look as far as I'm concerned if you're going to create what I think could be created by Humanity we have to create the engine not of rejection but of acceptance which meaning that like if you got a charismatic fin shapir Avatar in the video game in the simulation that we're in there's a way to reabsorb him into reality that isn't like the way people currently see him if he's willing to relinquish his ideology and he has a very strict religious ideology yeah he's stuck in this little thing but I think that's helped him that little thing look if you figure out a way to do something that helps you past most of the people that you're competing against But ultimately hinders you against the people the people who learn your lessons plus other lessons and aren't hampered by ideology and they pass you like you have to there's a moment where you have to figure out when you're going to let go he seems to have a very like clear mind that's what's cool about him he seems to like have a very insightful mind I like that I just feel like something about him it like smacks of like the Nazi intellectuals yes it does but he's Jewish and here's the thing I love when people get mad at me that I talk to them I'm like listen just listen to what we're saying listen he's not a bad guy he might not agree with him but me and him are having really really good conversations about why I feel like you can't tell an 18-year-old kid just pull your pants up and don't shoot anybody yeah we're having these like really nuanced conversations and he's allowing me because he knows I like him so you're like the Bohemian GFF but it's no he knows I like him like Ben chapiro and I don't agree on many things but he knows if I see him I go what's up man how you doing I hug him and it's genuine I really care about him that's the whole point that's the whole point so if we care if he and I are sitting like right here and we talk about stuff he knows that if I don't agree with him I it's I doesn't change my feelings about whether or not I'll hug him or I love him that's it that's it yes that's the problem we're all facing we're all facing this problem where we identify with ideas whereas I think I think we can just do our best to make good with where we stand right now as a human and when we encounter other humans let's take IDE ideas and put them in front of us and Let's cross our arms and let's go over these ideas without any attachment that's where it gets hard because most of us don't have enough personal satisfaction and our own accomplishments to relinquish this idea that our ideas are not ours that our ideas are just it's just a mathematical problem it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Rubik's Cube it's a it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] game of Clue like who knows who did it is it Charlotte in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] library with a a rope we don't know so this thing that we're doing as people today is we're scared and one of the things that happened when people are scared is they pull back you pull back you you you you put up fences you wall off you protect your tribe your tribe gathers you decide what you can say what you can't say and decide who's the enemy and who's who's good and who's bad and and everybody walls off and my thoughts are are that's a trap and that is just something that we've been involved with forever from the beginning of time from single- cell organisms to small mammals to human beings we've been involved in this weird trap of competing against each other in the wrong way competing against each other in a way where ultimately somebody gets victimized I think the best competition is keeping the other competition alive competing against each other while helping each other and everybody gets by everybody gets better and even people who are not doing well you tell them why they're not doing well that will force you to do better right all of the people that trying to take your position if there's a ladder you say this is why you [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and then you'll do better cuz they'll do better and then everybody does better yeah there's no stagnation I get it it's just like the pro like you're in a you're in a like brutal position you're in a really brutal position like and no matter matter what I don't see how you can resist it like the problem with your your position is you have this like powerful voice that's the problem is like you're you're a signal booster and like I also got a NASA suit and I can hold my piss for four hours son how do you how have you not pissed but but but but to me like the the bizarre like the difficult situation you're in is like you get Ben Shapiro you signal boost that whatever that is I don't know what he is by the way he's not a bad guy I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to attack you your [\\xa0__\\xa0] like whatever the thing you did with like attacking the music video was [\\xa0__\\xa0] that was an embarrassment that was a mess that was a mess it was a mess I get it it was really sex negative it was so stupid he seemed like such a nerd a dork like and also anybody who's going to like do that you like feel like they they negate whatever their philosophical ideas by attacking the think gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] however he's doing the exact same thing that Trump does when he gets attention he's saying something about something that's culturally relevant and he's taking a contrary position and he's generating likes he's generating interest right he's like a a he's a he's a salesperson for negativity if I was his best friend and Ben and I were sitting around he's like you think you're supposed to like okay okay yeah you probably should cuz like ultimately people going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] with you but my my position is is it's better if you have vulnerabilities yeah if if there's something you've done that's really stupid it's probably better for you when you [\\xa0__\\xa0] on things yeah and I think that's a good argument for coming out against wet ass [\\xa0__\\xa0] that what's wrong with wet ass [\\xa0__\\xa0] by the way nothing nothing but a guy like Ben Shapiro he shouldn't be right too many times part part of his charm is his failure part of his charm is he casually he's got a say some [\\xa0__\\xa0] that only a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude with a yamaka says it's not that he's a bad person yaka there's a lot of jewi J's Jewish listen listen I love Ari but he doesn't wear a yamaka okay you're saying the yamaka means fundamentalism wear you don't have to wear it so now we're in space we're flying you've gone from rejecting here's us as a golf Bo flying through the universe C your impossible look man I don't I didn't want to get I don't care about [\\xa0__\\xa0] B shapir I

I don't mean to do this every time I'm on but you have such a such a crazy power that if you're not careful folks from deep dark Wells of perspective are going to infiltrate your [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude have you watched that great documentary on uh the like white Aryan folks man it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up like this dude why you got to go there give me that lighter here you go like yeah you you look at like these people are very organized man it's like they're organized is what I'm saying and like I'm and again I'm not saying Ben shapir as this person he wears a Yama he's Jewish what I don't know much about him I don't care I don't care listen to me listen to me all those people that are organized they come hang out with us give me a hug you don't want to give them a hug relax why just relax all those people are just people man like a white supremacist they were lost they imagine if you gave a white supremacist 5 Meo DMT and let him sit on a couch one of them brown suede couches they take three big hits and then as the first one as they're exhaling yeah yeah yeah and they get sucked into the center of the universe and they realize there is no Center cuz there is no boundaries it's all connected you're in a soup you're in an infinite soup of ideas and biology and thoughts and prayers and Love and Hope and happiness and jealousy and anal sex and it's all together who with cartoons and pop music and cheeseburgers who just a bunch of different experiences all [\\xa0__\\xa0] stitched together and some sort you're saying there's a Redemptive possibility and then the then the aliens land yeah look man this is the way I see it I don't know man who gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] like really it's like you know the the the the reality of it is is like we are in a very bizarre Peri period in time which is that you and I we became friends on the phone having these same conversations and now you say a thing that flies in the phase of the of the particular like default reality of our time and you start trending on Twitter you know like that's like some of our communic like the way I know you right now is like you trending on Twitter where I'm like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] happened but the jokes on them because I don't read Twitter you don't go on Twitter at all I don't read it I post things like today I posted Ali Letterman made some masks it's just poster masks Joe it's just weird because it's like you're like a but it's not me it's what they think I am it's who they decide to am yeah but you have to watch out cuz people are going to like try to exploit you that's the main thing is like people recognizing what you are who have political agendas will infiltrate your [\\xa0__\\xa0] and then start blowing out their radioactivity into the world right that's a fear radium like face rotten [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah yeah exactly like they'll get in they'll get in there and then like all of a sudden like you accidentally start exing [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's like that that you know you don't agree I know you don't agree with like Ben Shapiro listen it's not that I don't agree with Ben Shapiro and I definitely don't on many things and he and I talked about it it's said I don't want to abandon him oh that's that's cool I don't I don't think he's worthy of Abandonment CU I think he's a good person right and I think many of the things he said says he says cuzz he's rewarded for saying controversial things on the internet many times make sense and you know a logical way if you don't take into account all the different situations that lead to a person becoming who they are in 2020 right slavery and Jim Crow laws and all these different things we all have to deal with but I think he's a good person I really do I think many of times like the things we say were half defensive and and and and and half promotional you're saying things cuzz you think that people are going to react in a certain way you don't necessarily mean it and you also say things because you've seen the contrary to that poorly worded and you decide you don't agree with that and so you want to counter it but I think the problem is in ideal ideologies more than anything is if I'm really being objective I always feel like our problem is purely in ideologies because we just get committed to one side or the other and ideas to one side you're right or you're wrong and I think if we could just divorce oursel from ideas and divorce oursel from all ideologies and just look at something like honest like you come to me and I come to you and I go hey man what's up I go what are your intentions my my intentions is to live a harmonious life with my neighbors and I said might as well okay good beautiful and you hug each other and you go what do we have to do about tax man if we lived in a community where I felt like hey if I pay more in taxes people will have their kids in a better school and uh the water will be pure and you know there there be less crime I would [\\xa0__\\xa0] 100% sign up for that but I don't think the people that are taking that [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing and running with it know what they're doing that's right that's the problem you believe in the idea of democracy you just don't believe in the organ ganizational facility that's like administering democracy been to the red line of human beings I know where people fall apart I know the red line I know when the RPM's hit I know when people [\\xa0__\\xa0] out and I know I'm not going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] out and if you're going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] out I know I know you're if you're bitching out and you're also making you're making laws right what are you saying what what are you doing what's going on who are you why are you deciding what people do we shouldn't have any figureheads it's dangerous Alpha chimps are dangerous take it from me a person with a big platform you shouldn't listen to me you shouldn't listen to you you shouldn't listen to Bert ker shouldn't listen to Tom sagor Ari Safir AR Shir or Joey Diaz or name all the people you love to listen to Sam Harris don't listen to them meaning listen to their show but apply to whatever they say your own objective opinion but how weird is it that people will focus that you have Ben Ben Shapiro on this podcast but they don't they don't Focus that you have Bernie Sanders on how weird is it but they do they do Focus but what I'm saying is like people in the left will say you're a monster that you would have Ben Shapiro on and they've completely forget that you gave one of the great potential socialist presidents of our time of platform that you supported they forget that and Andrew Yang and tulsy G to me that's of my favorite that's the part that drives me nuts is it's like why do they forget that I'm a Savage that's why what do you mean I'm a Savage I'm a [\\xa0__\\xa0] cage fighting commentator I do I commentate for UFC I do stand-up comedy I do wild comedy I'm a wild person it's a different thing I understand it's just a we we have to stop trying to push people down in order to push ourselves ahead and if we just all look at it like look there's things about all sorts of aspects of society that I don't agree with that smart people disagree with right I don't know if they're right I don't know if I'm right I don't know I would like to talk forever to people that are vegans like my friend John Joseph he's the singer the the the crom mags he's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] interesting dude man you know and he he's a he's been a vegan forever and he's like a super [\\xa0__\\xa0] strong guy like mentally physically just triathlons I want people to think different than me I want them to right I want bad [\\xa0__\\xa0] to have a completely separate ideas of how the world should or shouldn't work what is wrong or isn't wrong what's right or isn't right what's privilege what's [\\xa0__\\xa0] I want everybody to come to the table clean I want everybody to come to the table warm I want everybody to hug I really do and I think we're all scared and I think it [\\xa0__\\xa0] up everybody and if everybody who wants progress doesn't want people to feel good about running into each other and talking things through we're going into this thing with the wrong energy the right energy is going into this thing going listen I didn't ask to be born you didn't either here we are 2020 trying to figure the world out but let's just admit the the idea of wrestling between gay and straight black and white male and female those are so dumb I don't want to do that I don't want to do that I want I want to be I want to talk to honest and dis honest I want to talk to secure and insecure I want to talk to loving and hateful I want to hug people that needed I want to figure out a way where we can get through this in a better State than we were five years ago 10 years ago let's get through this with food and water and realize we didn't need a [\\xa0__\\xa0] MX platinum card I don't want a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I I don't want it I don't want go go home you're going to be president no I don't want to be president no it doesn't matter I don't want any president that's what I want I want no president they're going to run this in your anti- campaign but you're going to I could see it happening man we should postpone the election try to find a better way to do this no do the [\\xa0__\\xa0] election get Biden in there get a non lunatic in there what we need is um romantic tension between a 24y old like super super liberal super attractive woman and like a 32-year-old Navy SEAL who's also married and no one cheats on anybody but they have the sexual tension and they keep it together and they work their way through veganism what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] and what are you talking about I'm trying to [\\xa0__\\xa0] fix the world Duncan I'm trying to tell you that all the things that we see pros and cons pluses and minuses is yeah man I'm just trying to figure out like we got to the election and suddenly it's this erotic romance between this 24y old that's so much better than a [\\xa0__\\xa0] guy with fake hair and some dead man weakend at Bernie with a cop shoving her hand up his ass and walking him to the aisle here's the thing that I don't understand in sports somebody in any [\\xa0__\\xa0] sport if they're not doing great that night the coach pulls them off and puts someone better in here's the thing Duncan Trussell no one wants that spot the replacement no one why who wants to be president I would love to be [Laughter] president the [\\xa0__\\xa0] the [\\xa0__\\xa0] the [\\xa0__\\xa0] look at your face oh oh my God Jamie I don't want to go through an election but like I would like that listen elections are so archaic that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] wood stoves yeah but I would love to be president being president would be so fun would it be here's the best part you could exonerate all your friends that is the the most ridiculous thing about being president you can the best you can just decide you're out I'm gonna pardon out by the way he's a bad guy but he's a good guy and here's a really important thing the Trump Administration just let out one of the great LSD chemists of our time who's that I can't remember his name it's so sad if you look it up don't say it don't say it don't say it no you should say blew up that guy spot that was throwing cigarettes on the ground in Utah no look he deserves to be his name deserves to be spoken you know who contacted me recently who do you remember the nuro soup story William Leonard peard do you remember uh I'm so drunk me too do you remember neuros soup yeah yeah she was a girl who was on YouTube and her and I I I went back with her this is an interesting thing she had a a a detailed account of how she put DMT up her [\\xa0__\\xa0] she dated William Leonard peard yeah yeah that's the guy that had the LSD lab in the middle of the bunker and the DMT accelerator pedal he contacted me okay and from prison I don't know I just got an email and um it's not my main account but I was like hm maybe that's real but that lady um she had a whole YouTube series about different ways she took drugs yeah and one of them was she took DMT up her [\\xa0__\\xa0] woo it

is Honeycomb Cheerios I want to I want that in my life I want to be around someone who's like I that's so free put it up your [\\xa0__\\xa0] would you even consider it yes really I would put DMT up my ass I've thought about it after I heard about it it's a good way to let the UN Universe no you give [Laughter] up it's the end it's a video game it's a part of the video game where you're like done dud come move to Texas please North Carolina [\\xa0__\\xa0] where the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you're moving why do we have to be localized you want to live in Tennessee I want no I look we don't have to be locked into any place bought you a house we don't have to be locked into a place Joe I appreciate you and by the way I know you I want to fix things I know that you buy houses of your friends I want to fix things so sweet you would say that but look we don't have to be spatially disconnected I think we can fix things Duncan we can all you're already look man you're already fixing things I think you can help me I would I will help you any way better with you I'm better with you than without you listen man I'm better with you than without you that's real that's real it's true you and I both talked about this not just on podcast I think but even like on just phone calls but that when we do podcast I feel like you bring me to a place that I don't really get without you yeah we're friends really I really feel like that because I've known you so long like I remember when you had this breakup and we lived together and you called me up like I don't know what to do I'm like [\\xa0__\\xa0] man come live with me yeah I was so happy I was one of the comics that you evolved and when and also like in that that moment where I was living with you it wasn't like some kind of like National Lampoon Vacation thing you were like really serious with me and you were not serious all the time we had a few like really serious talks and in those serious talks you like help me realize that like I had to stop being so flippant with my life and it was really good and you weren't [\\xa0__\\xa0] around it was cool and it was very sweet and I'll never forget it man and and uh well you know what I wanted to say to you th this is this was what when you see someone who is at a bump in the road many things can happen right yeah and for you I wanted you to know that like you can most certainly get upset along the way at different or you can be almost almost immune to all the bumps in the road it's really how you decide and if you decide you're this [\\xa0__\\xa0] Peter Pan character and just like float through this like there's ways that you're lucky in ways that other people that live in Afghanistan and the Congo will never understand never understand now man you weren't letting me do that but you and I when we were hanging out together I was like I was like I remember the moment you called me there wasn't even a half a second between you say I was like Yay Duncan's going to live with me y that's sweet man and I wanted you to get in the tank and and I got yeah oh that's great man I love it and like I I'm not trying to like your perception of it may even be different from mine but like one qu one thing that happened I have a few memories of that incredible gift that you gave me one of the memories is riding up to your house I don't even know how you got into my car that you would be in my Mini Cooper which was red at the time I remember that we're driving up to visit you we're listening to Elliot Smith I'm playing Elliot Smith yes he's talking about [\\xa0__\\xa0] morose things and you I this so I remember like and I've been listening to that nonstop so we're riding up this hell to your mansion and listening to Elliot Smith in my mini C so this is like I this is before your podcast but before you had become like what you are now just imagine folks listening riding in a Mini Cooper with Jo Joe Rogan and our cherry red byy Cooper trying to play Elliot Smith for him CU it's really been moving you I'm not playing it for you cuz like any other reason than this is what I've been tuned into for like a long time and so we're riding up this hill to your to your Manion and I remember you look at me in this way that only like real friends can do this and you look at me and you go you have to stop listening to this you are like you can't listen to this anymore like this is terrible this is like hurting you and it was it wasn't from a judgmental place or a place of musical Brilliance it was a friend being like dude you are depressed that guy gives out a vibration you know he was he was incredibly depressed and and Incredibly talented a terrible Nexus so good so good and he was a trap but like it's a trap but it is a trap it's like you can squeeze out some really super positive juice and then to the left of your body you're filled with cancer like that's that's the that's the problem with people that there's there's so many different things where people are depressed and morose and they're talking about really dark things but dude it wasn't just you like so I get to your house I'm in this Mansion all of a sudden you had a that was this when you had a [\\xa0__\\xa0] piranha tank do you remember that you had piranhas remember so all of a sudden I'm in a like Mansion where there's a piranha tank and Eddie Bravo I remember cuz I was going up like to fake to like hide smoking cuz I I was addicted at the time and so yeah and I remember like I was sneaking up to smoke and at some point Eddie Bravo I'd like gone up this hill to like like hide smoking and Ed Eddie Bravo walks up the hill to me and is like imitating smoking to me making fun of me for being addicted to cigarettes but like but like you know you know what but Joe you know what happened like if I live this is where I really go back and I think Eddie Bravo in that moment I'm like what a prick don't tell me not to [\\xa0__\\xa0] smoke cut to me sitting in front of a doctor being like well you have cancer in your balls and I and I and I remember like referring back to that moment where he was like stop smoking yeah you know what I mean which was cool it was like like there's so many like in those moments well there's a thing where you can do where you can protect people temporarily from their emotions but you won't protect them from the consequences of their actions that you see that may they don't and I think we're all responsible for our friends blind spots and when we see blind spots go hey hey hey hey hey there's only so much you can do though there's only so much you can do now Eddie Bravo could have like turned into a dragon and been like creepy right nicotine's a very addictive drug man it gets you it get get you in a weird way but he was legitimately trying yeah to get me to stop smoking Eddie Bravo is a good man that was a sweet moment like when I look back I always like when I look back precancer I always think of that moment it's like man you thought that guy was such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] like you thought he was such aun because you didn't want to quit that Hab yes if I I always like but you look back like he wanted me to do better he didn't want me to get one of my balls chop I got L I got L I got lucky because like it didn't spread through my whole body and I didn't die we have two choices right now I can pee my pants or I could run to the bathroom and we stop it and then we come back no don't stop but I've never had it where you go to the bathroom talk to Jamie we're five hours in how many hours it doesn't matter I got to be so bad be right amazing I've been Dy I've been dying for this moment Jamie just so you know like through the years of us doing Rogan I usually am the one who has to go to pee Oh my God but in this moment here I am in a with the thing happening and uh you know it does what does he do in this spot with when the guest leaves what does he does he say pull something up you're doing no he feel just talk he just yaps yeah well uh good at it subscribe to my patreon dtfh we have a Tuesday we have a meditation uh Wednesdays we're doing a doom book club it's amazing the book Doom by Frank Herbert is incredible Fridays we have a family gathering it's just us hanging out but join us there uh you know the truth is it is a simulation you know and we told you that before you linked into the thing and uh we told you we would wipe your memory and that you would feel like you were uh helpless in the sense that the thing you are right now you don't know what the power that you wield so you you chose that just you know and we said that in this moment we would do a thing where we alerted you of the fact that you had been you had intentionally decided to dive into a simulation making you limited very powerful you're Thor in the in the human world that you're in right now you're actually Thor you uh you're you're a powerful Norse god that has gotten sucked into a very temporary like magic spell isn't even that powerful compared to the powers in the world you come from but right now you have become convinced that you are a limited identity in the Mortal realm which you requested by the way you said I want to be an insurance agent real estate agent school teacher psychologist fireman cop I wanted to be an a pilot somebody was a flight attendant someone who worked in a mum teacher somebody who was a historian a failed writer a failed comedian you and and you became this temporary thing but the truth is you're a God and you're confused Joe welcome back oh my God I peed so hard it was amazing I don't want it to it I just want everyone to know if you're like if you're like no one should have this amount of uh influence no one no one should be able to say things that affect politics no social ideas you're right I don't I don't I agree with you right I didn't want to do this right this is a weird thing yeah but I'm doing my best that's stop I'm not stopping D you're going to retire because like no matter what you do it's like Jiu-Jitsu you can't go for a choke just right away you can't just dive on the choke yeah you got to slowly cook the person slowly where work through positions what's the joke here re naked real naked you get the mounts you let them Buck you off you get half guard you hold on you escape side control you try to mount again they turn over you get their back hooks in squeeze Jesus Christ takes time all things take time don't you worry though like that like what if like and again like we've been going on so many hours now so now at this point I'm just fing how much time has this podcast going on 4 minutes and 40 seconds but don't you wor 4 hours and 40 minutes Joe don't you worry that spy's first episode we're right I was right I knew it you knew it I'm like Duncan has to be number one do you know you had to be number one when you invited me on I didn't even I tried not to think about it because I was so flattered by you have to I felt Darkly flattered and then I and then I on your like subreddit I saw the don't read that the votes for who crazy people I saw the votes for who would be on the number one thing I wasn't even listed Joe those people are fools no they're not I I actually listen listen to me they're fools I know what I'm doing look at this [\\xa0__\\xa0] knife dude tuckamore custom knives shout out did but like not to like I do feel like a kind of people are fools they're wrong listen you you have helped me in many steps of the way because uh you and I as friends um you know we we we came from different backgrounds but we're both very compassionate and very interested in exploring alternative ideas both of us and we we we you and I have had so many conversations where you said something to me and I've went hm damn maybe huh and I've had to reconsider the way I was focusing in on something and because I respect you and this is something I've said of Ari as well and and Joey and even Eddie Bravo and Jamie and all the people that I'm around if if you say something to me I consider it like I'm thinking of it in a different way like if you say I don't think that's a good idea because of this I go huh okay tell me why right and I I'll let it go I I I'm I don't want to be I don't want to cling on to that early idea man and I think that's half our problem that's half our problem you know I've always felt like a weird sense of guilt about Eddie Bravo man cuz like Eddie Bravo uh want me to do that yeah yeah thanks dude I always felt like a weird is a Gil Jamie said yeah I thought he to cut his finger off last time he did I felt I felt like a weird s a gill Edie Bravo cuz like and I don't agree with all his conspiratorial ideas no I don't either but neither does he but dude this is an important thing like this is an important thing like not only did he tell me to quit smoking and then I got one of my [\\xa0__\\xa0] B and I got one of my balls chopped off well he was right about that but right but I want to tell you another thing he said don't eat [\\xa0__\\xa0] he said another cheers brother he said another thing to I do feel like it's worth mentioning I've always felt a weird sense of guilt because I I think I judged him harshly and it makes me feel like a a dumb dumb but like like cuz he's like a jiujitsu master you know so like I always he's you know he's my master yeah like if someone said who's your master I'd say first John jock Machado second Eddie Bravo one of my best friends is my master so I always felt I always had this trick at the very least a trickling sense of like man I think you're ra about your judgment there but but it's dangerous yeah it's danger can kill you yeah well that also talking that's the problem anytime I've been talking to him I'm always a little bit like nous at any moment I could die it's like a pet snake yeah like what if some at some moment you do like go insane and decide to kill me I won't I won't you know who I feel like that around who Joey Joey Diaz yes what are you you think he would kill you no no no no but he's so wild he's so crazy he like he's like a bear I want to keep feeding Joey Diaz is like you know he's the goat you know that right well I do like you know he had he he's the greatest of all time there's no one who's ever been funnier I've I've seen Joey Diaz hit like frequencies I've never seen anybody else hit yeah he was hanging out in uh Colorado with like like around Shambala which is like the place like my meditation teacher's teacher was teaching Boulder Yeah man so he encountered some like beings there that were like really Advanced and like he he he actually he like digested some of that stuff like he's wild Joey Diaz is wild remember like to me like the thing that like you know one of the aspects of this particular moment the kie Yuka that so [\\xa0__\\xa0] up this is kuga right yeah it has to be well kuga like a lot of people explain so kuga it's the age we're in right now explain the yugas so the yugas are like vast spans of time and we're considered to be in the kuga now the other this is like something that was actually actually predicted several years ago yeah well hund like thousands of years ago but in terms of like people recognizing this right now is kuga kuga there's there's AR there's like you know differences what part of the kuga we're in but there's no difference in that we're in the kuga explain the yugas I'm sorry the yugas are a period of time that um um one of the ways to like that they get represented is like uh imagine a dove flying through the sky with a silk scarf and in the beak and the tip of the scarf brushes against the peak of the halalas so the amount of time it takes for one of those Peaks to get pushed down to a valley that could be considered a Yuga it's like it's a it's a it's actually a in Hinduism it's a it's a period of time and people argue about that length of time negotiable it's negotiable but there's certain symptoms for each Yuga and so the K Yuga the uh symptoms are uh you can't remember very well your memory's all [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you're impetuous you're fat you're fast in your decisions you're easily addicted you know if you look back at the uh history of Hinduism the vadas were originally sung so they were memorized and people would sing them they would sing them and they weren't written down writing is considered a degradation yeah yeah it was written down because they heard it and then they they like it was written down later down the line the idea was you didn't need to write anything down cuz you would memorize it I I remember when I was a kid in high school my friend Brian catel going through all the numbers he' memorized and it was so many he had so many phone numbers memorized because we didn't have phones so you had to memorize numbers or write them down in a little pad so what we consider to be technology is really a crutch to make up for our idiocy in the age of the kuga which is what we're in right now and a lot of people get confused because they think Kali means kie the goddess of Destruction how many youas I'm not I think four three or for what what do you know I don't know the I don't know the answer I only know the Jamie's like this is an 8 Hour podcast even know how to look this up right now you have to give him overtime pay I've been trying to figure out too that not that I want to end this at all but this being our first Spotify podcast it kind of has to be two we have other things I don't know how they're going to deal with this file and whatnot well we we we're right now at 5 hours into the podcast right how many hours yeah 5 hours we should just make it two two and 1 half hour podcast I feel like I've been stopping it should we I don't know how to I don't want it SP Spotify I know what I'm doing this is why I brought Ducky on I'm GNA miss you man that's the main thing You're Not Gon to miss me I'm GNA be around you come on dude you want to live in South Dakota I'm sorry I forgot I didn't want to South Dakota my sweet home I [\\xa0__\\xa0] Arizona sorry I'm going to South Dakota and I can't wait but dude it's rough to come in here see people pack cuz look man here's the main thing it's like we're not packing Stone yeah dude but it's not we're not packing ourselves up because of some like like like tones Thompson thing we're packing ourselves up because the country we were born into has fallen into the throws of a really dark period induced by a once in a hundred-year pandemic that's what I'm saying but why do you want to live in a place where none of us are living why not think about this I I know why I don't want to live in Austin I know that why well cuz I'll tell you why Joe if you really want another real dark reason cuz you announced it you know what I mean had you not announced it it might be a different story but you and Elon Musk was G to get out anyway yeah but elon's coming to Austin you're coming to Austin talking about it I know so welcome like Austin that's Silicon Valley so no yeah yeah dude yeah I'm sorry but that is what you have created by your I do you know uh Matthew has a great idea what he wants to make a primer for people moving to Austin where you say hey don't turn what you escaped from into the place you're going to oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's brilliant yeah don't turn the place you're escaping to exactly like where you fled yeah man yeah I get it brilliant and that's he's right Austin this what we we were talking about earlier we're we were talking about defunding the police and defunding ice and Def like all this nonsense that people are like let's just like figure out a way to be nice to each other yeah man I agree and I don't think that's based on any locality now the Austin thing I like offline I'll tell you my decision cuz I did offline I didn't think about it Joe I thought about it what turned you off to it well you know my my feeling is it's it's I'm stammering cuz it's like telling you why I would reveal where I'm headed and I don't mean to be like like all magical about that but the main thing listen let me say where you are headed is a great choice thank you brother I've been and you fit in there like a pee in the Pod I might wind up being there you might I'm ready to keep moving listen this is the thing I think about the Spotify deal and and and just the idea of what a is moving forward I want you to be involved it's why I wanted you to be number one and like legitimately you and I have some of my favorite conversations brother I love you man I love you too we've been friends for a long [\\xa0__\\xa0] time yeah man I'll be involved with anything you're involved then let's do it and I I meant that and by the way not not not to go back to Eddie Bravo apologetics but I didn't finish my point back then and I think it's an important point to make he said to me something that was so [\\xa0__\\xa0] weird when he said and this was on top of him taking on a missionary stance with my inhalation of tobacco smoke so by then I was already like over little defensive I was defensive and I I didn't I I was like I was too dumb at that time to like recognize like [\\xa0__\\xa0] man this guy's got a [\\xa0__\\xa0] like he's a jiujitsu master so what he's saying is not coming from like a place of someone who like hasn't like worked really hard at a particular he's saying just don't kill your body yeah but one thing he's said to me which is I always think back to it cuz I really remember when he said I was like you sick of Fant and what he said to me was exactly what's happening to you right now what did he say he said you have no idea what's going to happen to him he's going to be like like he's going to be so huge and I remember him saying it this was this was Fear Factor it was not like a safe assessment man it was like when he said it to me it felt culty it felt [\\xa0__\\xa0] up it felt like it felt crazy right and it was I I remember him saying it to me and like being like man you're I didn't say it cuz I was afraid of him we I'm thinking like you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] crazy that you would think that but he you know it's weird that he's right you know that's what's weird about it it's like this is is your first episode on Spotify and it's crazy man because like I get and I'm honored deeply honored that you invited me out well there was no second choice do you know that thank you brother you were First Choice 100% across the board when they said who do you want to have first on Spotify before they said Spotify is a dunan trussle that's so cool Joe I appreciate so cool and I I really believe that what what I said that I think you and I have different shows there's something about you and I together that is different than just me by myself man we friends we we're not just friends man like we've known each other for so long and there's no doubt we've tested each other back and forth up and down and left and right we know we love each other like you know if if you call me up at 3: in the morning Joe I need your help like I am [\\xa0__\\xa0] there dude I'm a Commando I'm ready to drop in from a helicopter I'm going to save you yeah and because of that like because of our long relationship we've been we've been friends for so long dude I mean how long when do we like '90s when did you start working with the story '90s dude we've been friends since the '90s the '90s so more than 20 years yeah we we've gone you have seen me go from being the town court of The Comedy Store to being someone supporting themselves off of their comedy man like you you've seen me go from like you you were friends with me when I was like uh when I was when I was like no no one would have like ever gambled on anything happening with me other than no not no one just no one's stupid I saw it right away when the moment I first saw you do little hobo yeah dude I saw you do little hobo in the O and I'm like oh my God yeah man but you keep doing that that to me like that's the thing is like you keep doing that like that's the reason that you uh you deserve what you have you really do like all the haters all the people who are like I get the haters it's like it doesn't work the the the trick is it's like I get it if you're not a like someone explained it to me that like when you look at people that doing really well especially if they all socialize with each other it becomes like a Walled Garden and it feels like it's alienated it feels like you're you're isolated you're locked out and it makes you feel bad it makes you feel shitty yeah and that's the problem that's the problem dude you hated me you just so you know like when we first met no you didn't hate me but you were irritated by me cuz like you don't remember when you first met was in the belly room I was with Princess Corey Cory Como and like uh I was trying to at the time I was really into like it wasn't even called trolling them but it was like saying a thing opposite to what you should say and I remember like something you were a contrarian I was being a contrarian and something came up about marijuana you mentioned marijuana I'm sitting with Cory com I'm always I was already nervous around you cuz at the time you were like you know you were you were still like at that time you were still like in this incredible trajectory and like I made a stupid joke about how weed was like bad you know I'd come from like I was like you know there's never been a time that I haven't been high for years and you know what I mean especially then but I made this dumb joke about how weed was and I remember you looked at me with such such like a scaving look of like cuz you had just started like understanding how wonderful marijuana was and you really thought I meant we was bad and I remember Corey gave me this look of like no Duncan no don't don't do the joke it was a terrible moment because you weren't you weren't in a place where you could even like you weren't tolerating that because you were were getting high and starting to realize that it wasn't probably what well I think when I first started smoking pot I became a zealot like real quick because I realized i' had been lied to that's it and I had misunderstood the the the idea of what marijuana was I I became a zealot that's what it was you were a zealot in the look you gave me I remember the way you looked at me I realized like God damn he I bet he hates me forever never but today in the same situation I'd be like yeah right I funny you were defensive yeah yeah I was a zealot I was certainly a zealot once I first experienced marijuana I I became a zealot but you and I had such awesome conversations we had most of our conversations when we first became friends on the phone I would call you up I go yo dude I'm here uh Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday what's up what are you doing man like dude I read this Alice Huxley book and you start telling me about some crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] and you and I would just go I mean it would be like a a significant chunk of my day on like Monday when I would call in is that you and I would have these cool conversations so you take me on the road with you we go to the Irvine Improv we're driving back from the Irvine Improv in your car I'm so stoned you're playing Terrence McKenna Terrence McKenna is talking about the singularity and he's talking about like uh this idea that we're accelerating towards this point in the future novelty yeah and I I'll never forget that ride back from the Irvine impr I'll never forget it because like I'd never heard that Terence McKinna speech I knew about Terence McKinna roughly from like you know I I had encountered him in my earlier years as a psychona but like something about that particular lecture that you're playing something about leaving something as weird as a comedy show and this idea that he was saying and this is the part that still sticks with me to this day which is you know look we are heading towards a point of concurr currence of events that is known as a singularity and that the closer we get to it the more we're going to experience these think tachon particles being blown backwards through time that will produce these events in history that we call novelty and something about that ride back and just that moment me listening to it I started think I it wasn't like I even thought this isn't real I thought that is real and so here we are now 2020 in the middle of a pandemic you've become what has been described as the Oprah for men broa broa and you are like you are someone who like great leaders and principalities are trying to get into this podcast do you remember when you live with me and I started buying Buddha [\\xa0__\\xa0] started buying like you already had the Buddha [\\xa0__\\xa0] but I started buying all the I like bought a Shiva I bought this giant bronze Shiva I brought they're like and you go hey you know why you're attracted to this right yeah well that's what that's the thing that weirds me out about you man that's the part that where I'm like oh I get it it's like well there was some realization that happened and you're picking up on that and so because you're picking up on that you have ganes out here and you have all these like Eastern symbols but I just think they look cool no no I don't that's what I think well yeah you think you think they look cool but also you happen to have this massive audience uh regardless of whatever that is I just remember that uh that r i remember that ride back and I remember like I remember like thinking like you know I think there's something real in here like I think what McKenna is saying is probably true you know I think this uh pandemic I think this pandemic represents something he predicted which is we're in a novel wave right now this is It's been it's been a century since the last pandemic no no one here knows how to deal with this and now we're in a novelty wave and maybe well we got lazy we we didn't take into account all of the possible variables and a big one with this Administration was uh pandemics yeah man but not just that it's like the problem is like where you're kind of in a bit of a bind is that all this human attention has been placed upon you and you have to wrestle with your identity because that's why I need you to move to Austin you don't need me an Austin my friend come help me come on I can't do this to I'll help you I'll be I'm always there for you man but the problem is is like you have this burden of attention and it's like it's a it's a real like for whatever reason like some like you've people have decided you're you're one of the magnifying glasses focusing this beam of attention into the world and So within that is all this room for disaster it's like you know what I mean like room for disaster is the perfect way to put it yeah oh my God yeah someone pays attention to every aspect of your life there's so much room for disaster yeah man but I think at a certain point in time it's like there's a sacrificial lamb a person who lays himself down on the cross is that you no all of us it's all of us but you know it's a it's a really you are in a bit of a bind because the pro it's like look man here's what I love about not being George Washington I didn't have to make the decisions he made there I'm reading this book Dune it's so beautiful like if someone says Duncan I know you only have 14 teeth I don't have to make the decision but I can sell you all the rest of them for I don't have to I don't be Shillings I don't to be Jesus I don't two P I don't have to be church I don't have to be any of these people man I don't want to be them I would not assign myself to that Incarnation but like in Dune I'm reading this great book Dune by Frank Herbert it's so good and in in this desert world there's these beings called The Fan they're like they they they like have become they represent complet complete Attunement with nature and so at at this wonderful point in the book this Imperial like Galactic representative of this imperialism is like sitting in a like Canyon with all his wounded men they're almost done and the fman one of these tribal beings is saying to them you have to make a water decision and what they mean by that is your wounded men you have to pick one of them to die and we render their body into water because in this world there's no water so you have to make a water decision and the the fan is interacting with the being in this pure way which is the only only way you can act if you're truly in two of nature you're innocent and and it isn't like dark or anything he's like you have to make a water decision right and the being is saying to him like hesitating and the fan is saying to him do you want me to make the water decision for you and they don't mean it in an aggressive way they mean like would you you love these people would you give up the decision to us wouldn't you be enough to make the decision yourself fortunately in the book one of them dies and they they're able to like Ren their body into water but what I'm saying is like these being the position of power and all the whole series of Dune is based on this problem which is like if you get saddled with any kind of power even if it's a even if you want to pretend it's a kind of clownish power you are still in a very difficult situation because you have to make a water decision like you will have to like if you're Trump and you're a clown president or if you're Obama you're some Advanced president orone lost and there's only 20 of you yeah man someone's got to become water you have to make a water decision if you're if you're the president there 335 million people everything you decide is a water decision that's a little easier but if you're on Lost yeah there's 13 people left yeah man it's brutal it's brutal and like no matter what trick you try to use to deal with it no matter what trick you Ed you're still forced into this terrible it's a predicament man it's a Chinese handcuff situation it's like Chinese handcuffs are [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's not a Chinese handcuff that's ever been invented it's going to hold me down it's a creepy Place Chinese handcuffs are like this yeah well yeah I know I know man but it's ultimately it's like damn I always feel bad it's like I never want you to trend on Twitter whenever I see you trending on Twitter it really sucks for me cuz I'm like [\\xa0__\\xa0] is he okay that's what I hate about Twitter is like people will trend on Twitter you know what I'm saying and it's like I do I get it I hate it cuz I'm like [\\xa0__\\xa0] was it in a car accident I think just stay off Twitter yeah you're right I got to say on Twitter I just don't think it's good for you the problem is you're you're interacting with people that don't they're not communicating first of all and foremost maybe they're they're not communicating with people that are right in front of them so they don't feel social cues they don't feel empathy they don't feel so they're they're talking in this weird way that's only existed for like [\\xa0__\\xa0] 10 years it's at dunan TR on Twitter follow me Duncan trussle on Twitter no you're right IE you two L's two s's two L's no jiren laner you know like the idea is like get the [\\xa0__\\xa0] off social media I agree I don't think that's right either is it weird for this I think I think I think it's inevitable I think it's too big too much of a part of everything I think there's no I don't think there's a future in telling people to stay off it I think there's more of a future of telling people to understand what it is and manage it to look at social media to look at Twitter and and Instagram and all those things and understand what they are I don't think you have to get off but you should you should spend a lot of time outside of that I got to get off there man it's not good to read comments it's not good to um Google your name I don't think that's good and that's how when you see me and you see I'm okay that's why cuz I don't do that those things you get crazy should we cut ourselves for Spotify should we like do like a little Blood Brother ritual where we cut our fingers and like mix our blood that's how you get your [\\xa0__\\xa0] covid test earlier let's do it we're like Co we don't have we don't have Co anymore should we like do a slice no come on it's good Jesus why not Duncan got all great all great rich rituals are based in like some kind of blood Bond do you think there's this honestly if you didn't know me if I wasn't your friend would you think there's a responsibility that I have that I'm not meeting no I think you're meeting it I think the problem is like no matter how like it's like the it's hilarious and in the in in Star Trek you know Captain Kirk they if you're going to be like someone who like gets to be a commander of a Starship you're given a problem that is unsolvable so no matter what you do it's you can't win no matter what like when you get to a certain level of power any decision you make on some level is wrong and right simultaneously this is quantum Computing my friend so I do not you know in my analysis of your podcast and all my deep judgmental qualities I do not see what you're doing as being wrong at all I see sometimes you make naive decisions that I would make too what would you say I think sometimes you have people on who later found out to be like at least in the moment they were on the show a little like [\\xa0__\\xa0] up like for sure in the early days I I had an issue in the early days where I didn't want to admit that I was getting as many views as there was and uh I would do a show and I'm just like no one's watching this and I would have some crazy person on and maybe uh there there was a few that was like I shouldn't have talked to that dude that dude was [\\xa0__\\xa0] up yeah but that was uh learning process you know that was there's there's a thing about doing a podcast where there's no school for it right there's no way to figure out how to do it perfectly it's not like learning how to play piano it's real linear there's all these weird ways to do it and no one knows so unfortunately I was like I guess like second generation first generation is for sure Adam Curry he's the poda and then there's like uh Adam Corola there's a few other people but I I came right after that yeah 2009 so no one knew what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] we were doing and I think there was a there's certainly been some times where I didn't want to admit that it was reaching as many people as it was yeah you can't think about that cuz it makes you feel crazy well that's why I want to have you on cuz I knew we were going to get drunk and get high and the first episode would be as Preposterous as an episode can be yeah and then from this you can like have people on who are like real or whatever I mean look man anyone ever I've ever talked to anytime I've ever been in a situation where people are talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] about you or or like questioning my friendship with you because I think because I'm because you had this person or that person on if I'm friends with you something's weird with you or me or whatever I all I always and will forever stand up for you man because I know you and I and I and and to me it's like look what like you got into this ridiculous predicament like you're in a you're in a bind man you are you are in a bind and it's a beautiful it's a beautiful bind but it's a real it's a real problem and but like because of your heart which is very open and very sweet you allow this like you allow everyone to have you allow a lot of people on your podcast that don't make sense according to the zis and so people get mad at you and they pound and and I I always feel so rotten about that because it's like man you don't understand this is a real Progressive like you're looking at someone who is exactly the being that you would hope would be the like result of like great government and great education and you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] attacking an ally that's the part that gets me up that's where I get really bummed is it's like man you have to understand that person look you should if you ask me I feel like Duncan should I have Ben Shapiro on I feel like no jo no there's so many better people to have on in that guy but that doesn't mean you can't have those other people on too well if you listen to me but I would say to you I go listen man I know what you're saying but if I just took you to dinner you me and Ben chapiro went to some [\\xa0__\\xa0] kosher joint i' love i' love hang out with him we I I guarantee you you'd like him no I know that he's a good guy the problem is not him the problem is all the people's reactions to him and him right those there two things going on two things the things that he said and the reactions and the fact that he's kind of weaponized their reactions yeah look he's a good guy look I don't I to me it's like I I would I would be so bored if you only have people on the show that I agreed with it would be such a shitty show but I I do have a a rule where I I won't have anybody on anymore unless I feel that they enter into those arguments with good faith yeah man I know that and I feel like Ben Shapiro he enters into all discussions with good faith he's not an insulting guy he he and I have had interesting conversations about gay marriage interesting conversations about um uh all sorts of uh aspects of society racial relations black lives matters and and and and he and I talked about it in a very respectful way even though we disagree there's been no there's been no insults there's been no shittiness and I think that's the problem with putting a guy like that on some sort of a standard traditional talk show you have him on and some social justice Warrior and they argue with each other and you got a host and you break every seven minutes to go to commercial you don't find out what he's about he's not a bad guy man and he gets shaped as much by those seven minute segments where you're battling it out to get soundes as you and I do byin spots at The Comedy Store trying to pass open mic night based on this podcast you would imagine that I have a chip on my shoulder about Ben Shapiro which I really don't I don't think you do I don't think you the reason I brought up Eddie Bravo is only because like uh I think like what you're doing is really sweet and good and I think your heart is in the same place it was and I met you a while ago which is pretty bizarre like they would somehow maintain a a thing that's integral you know I've met you know you meet people out here who go through rough patches and they're not who they portray themselves as initially they're actually like con artists or fuckups or like bad temporarily I think people get better but sometimes they're bad temporarily but you you really like have like maintained this I think a really beautiful kind of uh North Star regarding your ethics and your consideration and things so yeah man I I'm like I'll do anything for you really I'm one of your great devotees I'll kill for you Joe I'm one of your great devotees I I I really am too man I I feel like like legitimately honestly I I I I feel like I've been tested where I've been given an opportunity to help other people and uh I feel like it's uh there's no controversy in my mind my mind knows the right choice yeah man and so I've always tried to promote all these different comics and I think that that's what we should all do with each other I think I don't think we need to make all the money I think you need to make some money I need to make some money what do we need man we need barbecues and [\\xa0__\\xa0] Margaritas I've hugs I'm not a selfish person I've seen a lot of people be selfish I've never seen you be like this is the thing I don't care but here's how I'm selfish I'm selfish and that I'm not selfish cuz I know that being selfish is negative to you it's bad for you it's dangerous it's sloppy it's weak it's some [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] so I never I'm never selfish because I'm selfish because I don't want myself to be a [\\xa0__\\xa0] you discovered a like thing I figured it out when I was uh jealous I figured it out when I was younger I remember watching Comics who were better than me when I was like 21 and I was thinking like God [\\xa0__\\xa0] these guys how did he come up with that joke and then I and I I I don't remember when it happened but it was early like 21 22 I remember catching it and going oh I caught a bad pattern like I got this pattern where I'm jealous instead of like or I could be the way I was before I ever got into comedy which is inspired instead I was jealous and so it it made me realize like oh I've got a bad pattern that I'm I'm chasing this bad pattern do you remember that time Joe that we drank a bowl of blood in front of that m statue it was chicken blood we were dying anyway whatever look I feel like it's like I'm I I do is this the longest podcast ever look it doesn't matter where we we're done I got to pee again let's wrap it up wrap it up but what are we at and hours 5 and a half hours it's over we did it Kevin Smith was 5 hours we won Joe thank God you think you should do this in two podcast I think we should whatever you want to do care right listen Spotify don't get greedy we give you a 6- hour opening podcast 5 and half hour thanks my friends it gets better there's going to be actual scientists on this show if you keep listening uh I will talk Duncan Trussell into doing regular podcast either through Zoom Skype I have I I have thoughts I have ideas I want to help I would have this conversation if we were recording that's the funny thing I've I've only been I I feel like I've been extending it yeah just cuz I want to keep talking I know me too man we're going to help all right how they Kush that Jamie I'm sorry catch big kiss we should have done the blood ritual I would have cut myself we [\\xa0__\\xa0] up\""
