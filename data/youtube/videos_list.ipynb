XYZ and for/ Mina and here you will need to check your passport here you will need to connect your uh Twitter Channel and here you will need to post so this would be basically a tweet over here and then you can go ahead and mint this nft for 0.01 Bera now once you do that uh all you have to do is the next step is like uh you have to go to orbital Finance so this is like rinky B orbital finance and here you will need to select the chain as Bera and here you can swap some of the Bara for Sephia test net and simply click on send and it will execute the transaction for you now you can do this multiple times in order to get more interactions on the the barachan network now the next thing that you want to do is you have to go to m mina. marley.com and here you have to select uh baren so simply go ahead and search for baren over here and connect your wallet and you can deploy a new token on Minter so basically you can put like anything like uh B gods or something like a b God token and you can put the tiker as BG and simply click on deploy over here and then basically once you deploy the token you can start interacting with that token so basically you can mint more tokens or maybe if you want to go ahead and burn the tokens you can do it after deploying it and the last thing that you will need to do is you will need to go to bars.com over here and then uh you have to like actually select few memes and you can get a bar chain name over here so this is also absolutely for free so in order to Min this nft you don't need to spend anything this is free and I think the snapshot would be done in like uh two or 3 days and uh hopefully this should be a four to five figure airdrop although none of this is a financial advice do your own research before airdrop farming or investing into crypto and in case if you have any doubts and questions please feel free to leave a comment I would be more than happy to to help you hope you like my video thank you for watching\", metadata={'source': '2U_qF7zibdE', 'title': 'Complete Berachain Airdrop Farming Tutorial With $0 | Snapshot Soon', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 1601, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2U_qF7zibdE/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2024-03-31 00:00:00', 'length': 392, 'author': 'Crypto Insight'})]"

XYZ and for/ Mina and here you will need to check your passport here you will need to connect your uh Twitter Channel and here you will need to post so this would be basically a tweet over here and then you can go ahead and mint this nft for 0.01 Bera now once you do that uh all you have to do is the next step is like uh you have to go to orbital Finance so this is like rinky B orbital finance and here you will need to select the chain as Bera and here you can swap some of the Bara for Sephia test net and simply click on send and it will execute the transaction for you now you can do this multiple times in order to get more interactions on the the barachan network now the next thing that you want to do is you have to go to m mina. marley.com and here you have to select uh baren so simply go ahead and search for baren over here and connect your wallet and you can deploy a new token on Minter so basically you can put like anything like uh B gods or something like a b God token and you can put the tiker as BG and simply click on deploy over here and then basically once you deploy the token you can start interacting with that token so basically you can mint more tokens or maybe if you want to go ahead and burn the tokens you can do it after deploying it and the last thing that you will need to do is you will need to go to bars.com over here and then uh you have to like actually select few memes and you can get a bar chain name over here so this is also absolutely for free so in order to Min this nft you don't need to spend anything this is free and I think the snapshot would be done in like uh two or 3 days and uh hopefully this should be a four to five figure airdrop although none of this is a financial advice do your own research before airdrop farming or investing into crypto and in case if you have any doubts and questions please feel free to leave a comment I would be more than happy to to help you hope you like my video thank you for watching\""
