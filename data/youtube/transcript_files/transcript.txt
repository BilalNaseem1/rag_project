what are the best layer 2 token Investments going into this next bull market I've said I expect uh layer twos to be part of the Mania in the next when everyone gets crazy about crypto thousands of l2s launching is where the excitement's going to be and and then I'm going to make my next video talking about the scams to watch out for that also always comes with the crazy bull but in this video I want to talk about where the best places to put your money are now I've invested through eight bubbles I've done well but I'm not a trained financial advisor and I'm not corrupt enough for Golem Gensler so do your own research now before I even get into this I want to I want to explain my investment philosophy and I just I just tweeted uh my Twitter Dave LaVine zerom I just tweeted this because I saw a video with two of the biggest Tech Venture capitalists Brad gersner Bill Gurley made a video and and I tweeted that at 28 minutes and 20 seconds Bill Gurley says the largest companies have the highest growth rates and they talk about this for a little while and at 35 minutes and 12 seconds Brad gersner says no one feels smart investing in the big companies investors have been grossly underinvested in the big companies who have done the best and they talk about this for 10 to 15 minutes which is something that I have said for a long time stop chasing the tiny new everybody wants the shiny new and I've been saying this and to me it just seems like this old hardened rule that is so obvious and I don't understand why people don't see it however they talked in this video about how this is a bit of a new phenomenon I was like oh yeah you know it used to be that the big companies became large and slow and were always disrupted and and it was almost easier to find those and it was but a and you know for me it's not a new phenomena because I've always invested in the tech high growth Tech and I and I think you know why is this the phenomena why do the biggest companies seem to outperform and my theory is that do these internet-based businesses where Network effects are so powerful Network effects are even more powerful than we understand because we see it in in large things that totally suck they just still maintain their lead so imagine if you have good Tech and you're the leader like so my investment philosophy in this video one of the best investments no it's not going to be the tiny new things launching in six months that I you know no it is not yeah the small new it's also not oh let's buy a 100 and hope that one of them and I could make a whole video and go on on why that method I The Venture Capital method buy 10 one of them makes the whole portfolio that method most Venture capitalists don't make any money and they suck first of all so I don't even know that that method works but the they just pick the leaders it's just so easy and it wins That's My Philosophy you don't like it go find one of those guys drawing lines on charts telling you what's hot this week and buy their course okay so that being said you know okay so that makes me boring thus I have no followers but so what are the largest um the largest and established layer twos now let me also say did I make a video okay so okay let's reverse a little bit so the largest Network effect protocol is ethereum itself right which is eth which is not a layer two but in your excitement here don't go and dump don't forget about the king I think this should be 60 70% of your portfolio at least 50 and even our horrible Bitcoin at least 10% okay so you what you got left and you may have some other crazy ideas you want to do but so you know 10 to 20% of your portfolio in these layer twos your crypto portfolio that is okay and so for me it's like well who the leaders so boring right we've got now there's two types of layer twos you got the optimistic rollups and the ZK rollups bottom line is the ZK Tech long-term wins however it's brand new sort of just launching and they're not the biggest the optimistics has been around for a while and so they are the biggest and don't forget the possibility for example optimism is one of the large early optimistic rollups maybe they convert a lot of things to use this by the time ZK Tech is so much better optimistic sort of converts and adopts that Tech somehow right because it's not about the best tech it's not about the fastest and it's not about oh my God it's one tenth of a cheaper Network effects is so important okay so the fact that optimistic was first is a deal the fact that they're the biggest is important okay but keep your eye okay so as far as the optimistic rollups go we've got optimism I mentioned which is op and you've got arbitrum a RB these are the two biggest right now I made a video I just posted a video that talking about L2 beat you can go there to see who are the biggest l2s I mean just you know follow it that way now watch out for ones that they is they sell some stupid meme coin with a monkey wearing a hat and so the whole chain is huge for a week that doesn't mean biggest means actual long-term big right you know consistently not just big for week cuz that happens um so you've got those two now with OP they one thing you sort of want to do and and these things honestly also if you're just you know you're watching this because you're interested in crypto you like it you own some Bitcoin and ethereum and you're in coinbase I don't think you play this game I think you got to be on chain for this like maybe they sell these tokens in coinbase I don't even know but to me if you're not on chain it's just you're not in crypto and what are you doing here with the 10 to 15% of your portfolio I think it's and and so anyways but if you're on chain and op you want to lock this up in the governance where you're you delegate somebody to do your voting for you because they've done some aird drops I think they'll keep doing air drops and you get more op for free if you do that and you use the token on chain you're going to get free tokens uh AR I don't think arbitrum has been doing that now another thing to note both of these systems arbitr and optimism are issuing their software so that people can launch version chains optimistic chains arbitr chains that are all on their software so it's you've got you know EBAs layer goes to optimism you know and there's all these other layers twos but on the optimism chain they've got a bunch of chains going and one of their chains one of their biggest ones optimism is base which is coin bases Layer Two uh I don't know if you do like this or it's like this but whatever coinbase and and coinbase itself I all you know don't don't forget about coinbase as a crypto investment I think it's a little different it is a stock um and I don't know that I would buy it today it's up it was at 75 for a while it doubled it's come down a little ah watch that truck don't buy things when they're going straight up but I have like Bas partly and coin coin base partly because it's part and they're being very smart about the layer 2 strategy okay so we like those two then you know polygon okay so polygon and and I'm going to post a video I just listened to this video I think I tweeted it also I'll put it in the description below and maybe I'll put this other tweet that I mentioned at the beginning in the description as well polygon started they were early as a a side chain to ethereum and other words what it's not an official Layer Two thing about layer twos is they take the security they uh it's as when it's fully deployed it's as safe as being on the main chain polygon just launched like another chain it's like almost you could almost think of it like another L1 but they built it to was so integrated with ethereum they call it a side chain okay so it's not a layer two but they have they acquired the two best zero knowledge proof companies brought them in I built this thing and they're launching I don't know they call it polygon 2.0 the tokens going to convert from madic to P um and it's going to be I think the leading ZK rollup um now people have looked and I've had people comment to me oh you love polygon and it's not even on the list on l2b it's not even Layer Two why do you think it's the best it hasn't really launched yet their official Layer Two but when it does launch and again if you're interested listen to the video I put in the description below where it's going to have like a data availab it's going to have a version of um uh like a Celestia built into their Suite of uh products it's going to have an like an Igan L it's going to have the reaking it's going to have um it's just it's it's the best it's and and they have a huge it's probably it's one of the biggest chains out there and it's going to move to it so I believe you know I I don't I usually don't like to be early the before in the predict but polygon just keeps executing I have this is for me I made this 10% of my portfolio and it's probably less the 10 at this point because it hasn't moved this price nobody likes it because it's not the story of the week it hasn't launched yet that's when I like things I know I'm so boring go to a guy who's telling you go to another YouTube channel hurry to someone who's telling you what's going up tomorrow it's like my my mother every time she asks about a stock or Tesla you like it well you know do I like it if it doesn't go up tomorrow she doesn't want to buy it for 30 years I don't have that long I need to know it's going to go up tomorrow never buys anything okay so uh um polygon did I want to say anything else about that um no okay now oh another point about polygon and even the rollups in general there's an issue that people talk about you know you've got and I and I talked about this in my other video uh Solana against versus ethereum video that I just made I'm going to make a playlist on my channel YouTube Dave LaVine zom and I I'll do a tweet that has all of the videos in this L2 series The One solot versus ethereum which really was talking about one chain to do everything versus you know what we're seeing on ethereum and all the other chains really is this it's going to be chains like this you know it's it's it's a fractal right of of freaking chains right I can do this all day and but the but the concern everyone's head is well what if I got something here I I want to communicate with this one you know I got a I got a decentralized exchange and there's liquidity on all these well that's it's you're splitting up your liquidity or what if it's even on another one it's over here and here and here this issue definitely is solved in the long run I'm a little little concerned that it could be one of these things oh yeah we're going to solve it it takes long much longer than we expect however it's looking a little bit faster than I feared a while ago and polygon specifically their thing when they launched they he was talking specifically they're going to have a feature where if you go and you launch your own chain app built right in you can tap into liquidity and all the other polygon chains right and op their model of having their their all these other little opans I think they're going to have comp I I think the composability is going to be solved maybe the composability is not as easy as it is on salana you can watch that video for the for the pros and cons there um but but there was that okay next the other phenomena we are seeing with l2s is uh you know what they call an app chain now these are just simply applications that not only say oh I want to go to the new layer 2 Chain because it's faster cheaper and all that but they say we want to have our own chain and one of my one of my favorite tokens when I say favorite it's couple percent of my portfolio it's one of these small maybe hopefully you know shoot for the mooners uh fracks right uh which is the fxs token they are launching like next month I believe the fraxel train no fra fraxel like fractal but fractal they're launching their own chain now I I already recommend and have held forever fxs um so now they're going to launch their new chain first of all launch launching their new chain I am not going to be the first one to jump onto the new chain okay and I don't advise everybody you can understand if you're in Bitcoin now you're early to crypto you're early to bitcoin these things are longterm stories I remember when I built my website in 1995 I was like oh God I'm so late it was invented in '94 didn't get on for a whole year right you know cloud everyone's going to move to the cloud this was invented in the 90s it's still if you look at the stats it's like percent of computing that has moved to the cloud like 25 you know some percent 30% of the Computing has moved to the cloud and that's over how many years 30 years we got a long way to go you are early you do not need to get on the new chain the week it launches and I understand if it all works out you're a little early make a little more money I'd rather be right and and and and and and for that safety lose take a little bit off the table then be the first one but have risk andoss disasters right so anyways this thing's going to launch and I'm going to watch it and as usual you know if after three or six months everything looks good everybody's and I'm seeing people are moving there then I will do the schlep because I've got staked fracks there's you you got staked fracks you've got fxs I don't know I mean I mostly just have fxs however you could have lots of things and to move everything onto this new chain is a whole schap that you don't want to have to do if the thing ends up not working out but anyways that is also going to be another story where certain applications get their own chain and then that creates some there's an air drop and then whatever Shenanigans everyone gets exciting and on the side I I wouldn't go chasing all that stuff you know and trying to be the first one and these airdrops everyone's so excited for an air drop it is free money but again it's just not just be in the big if you're in the big leader and you hold it for 5 to 10 years you're G to beat all of these monkeys running around chasing the narratives of the week guaranteed okay now also there is a lot more going on than I've even mentioned here and things that I don't follow gaming there's a lot going on with gaming the leader probably polygon with is it I IM immutable IMX or whatever and I just I don't do gaming because if you want to do gaming you should be getting on and playing the games and trying you know and I'm just it's not for me and there's a lot of there's going to be thousands of player two's launching and yes some of them are going to be amazing my Approach and and and this is what I advise most people to do a new layer 2 is launching and it's going to take over the world you believe great write it down and at it's it's going to go to the moon and then it's going to crash and you buy it in the next bubble probably cheaper remember the new hot thing that launches during the Mania right we're going to have the M you got the Mania and then the crash and here and so we're like here the stuff that launches and this one we're going to see lots of stuff launching between here and here you buy it two years later here right which might be cheaper than here so when the new stuff is all launching every week just yeah I everybody body's thinking again all these people who are chasing what's going to go up next week what's The Narrative of the week they're here and they're like oh my God I'm going to make money when I do it here and you're all going to get stuck buying the most here and you're going to lose your money it's what H it happens every cycle I've been through eight bubbles I've seen it over and over eight bubbles in my life not eight crypto Bubbles and crypto bubbles are the most fun and fast um but anyways so I wait I wait and I buy it here and maybe it's here and two years later you buy it here but also when all the Press is is flying and everybody's chasing and everyone's excited about the new L2 it's very easy to believe a bunch of and predictions that don't come true and so when you're buying later it's not only it's probably the same price sometimes times lower often lower but you know it's actually good if you literally like it when it launches and you watch this thing and for two years and you still love it it's pretty good I had that with polygon I didn't get it at the I was like yeah we'll see you know and I didn't like cuz they didn't have in a layer two right chain link same thing chain link I mean everyone was yelling at me when chane link was here and here and here I said yeah you know what you're I just well some people said down here fine I was like I don't know then it got up it when it was expensive I was like oh wait I like and now you know what I like chain link fine I waited so I bought it here instead of buying it here I bought it here right I lost a little bit but it was a threeyear weight and you know what there's aund different things that you could buy around here but but after the crash you only like one or two of them again better to be right than a little early um okay so that's all I want to say I'm gonna make one more video on this topic next video will be about what to watch out for because the scams and the hopium that is going to come with all this stuff I think it's just you know we've seen it all before you know the types with the with the scams and oh my God and get rich quick and all that stuff that stuff also follows a pattern and I think we're going to see that come and I'm going to give you some warnings on what to watch out for all right but anyway so with this video again uh well comment below let me know blah blah you know anyways I'm Twitter at Twitter Dave LaVine Z the number zc YouTube Dave line.com thanks watch
