l_BXeR2tJAw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_BXeR2tJAw,could AI be the future of blockchain near protocol is among the projects making a push into AI since roughly a year ago now most recently near protocol's co-founder and CEO Ilia po zukin was part of a panel at nvidia's annual conference the transforming AI panel was hosted by Nvidia CEO Jansen hang and amongst the speakers invited Ilia was the only one involved with blockchain technology making this a significant move for near protocol leading up to the conference n's native token almost doubled since the beginning of March thanks to the hype surrounding the event alongside the frenzy that has floated the prices of a bunch of AI related tokens so if you're interested in learning more about near protocol and its efforts to bring crypto and AI together this video is for you like many other l1s near protocol is a proof of stake layer one blockchain that gives AA ERS a platform to build decentralized applications but did you know that in the beginning near wasn't even involved in blockchain in 2017 Ilia Pushkin a former Google engineer and Alexander skidanov a former Microsoft software developer founded near. a and were completely focused on artificial intelligence research and development the company was dedicated to AI related projects including machine learning and and the development of models and tools needed to advance AI then in 2018 near AI began to build the near protocol and launched the mayet in 2020 this pivot to blockchain was mainly driven by the company's need to overcome issues with traditional Financial systems and limitations in resources near protocol today is still being led by Ilia and Alexander Ila's vision for nearest Future is to become a fully Sovereign operating system with a personal AI assistant that can be optimized for users needs without revealing private information his vision also includes the ability to interact and transact with other user owned AIS together the team has an impressive funding history including raising 350 million in April 2022 just a few months after announcing a 150 million funding round prominent venture capit Capital funds involved include dragonfly Capital coinbase Ventures and tiger Global now let's get to the juicy part the technology behind near and exciting new features like I mentioned earlier the near protocol is a smart contract platform designed to improve upon ethereum by offering faster transaction speeds lower costs and higher transaction volumes all of this is achieved through n's sharding design called Nightshade Nightshade breaks up the blockchain into smaller parts known as subchains each subchain has different validators working on them which allows for more efficient processing and capacity with this design near protocol is able to scale linearly and continuously handle a growing number of transactions other than that near is focused on performance and usability for both developers and users users who are new to crypto will benefit from The userfriendly Experience such as human readable account names while developers can enjoy a range of pre-built building blocks and tools to easily integrate into their applications developers are also incentivized with rewards in the form of 30% of gas fees now n is taking a journey back to its roots by introducing near tasks an AI Focus feature built on the protocol and powered by N's blockchain operating system system which is the protocol's OWN decentralized operating system that allows developers to build on any chain without facing most of the complexity of swaps exchanges and multiple profiles near tasks is a gig economy platform designed for anyone interested in earning near tokens by completing simple tasks so these can include things like image labeling writing up commentaries or sharing photos to Twitter with specific tags then this output will be used to provide training data to optimize the performance of AI models with the introduction of near tasks the protocol is taking a step towards revolutionizing AI training through a platform that values and rewards human intelligence in the AI economy the long-term goal is to establish an interactive marketplace where various tasks are matched to users according to their abilities and where near tokens earned can be spent on new use cases to increase the tokens utility according to their documentation it seems a beta testing phase with specific user groups will be implemented sometime in Q2 this year before being launched to the public okay so then let's talk about the token a little bit so the native token of the near protocol is near and has a 5% inflation rate it is used for incentivizing validators and paying gas fees 30% of which is distributed to developers as mentioned earlier all collected gas fees are burned to promote scarcity leaving the actual inflation rate to be approximately 5% minus transaction fees on top of that near has established a protocol treasury that receives 0.5% of the total near Supply annually this treasury is dedicated to ecosystem development and supporting governance initiatives there are 1 billion near tokens created at Genesis which are allocated to community grants operation grants Community sale core contributors and more now at the time of shooting near has a total supply of over 1.1 billion and a circulating supply of just over 1 billion tokens near has over 284 million in tvl with lending protocol burrow and liquid staking protocols linear and metap pool making up about 85% according to the team 2023 was a year that saw 7 million monthly active accounts and an average of over 2 million transactions per day since then daily transactions have been steadily increasing on January 11th this year the near Foundation announced it would reduce its team by approximately 40% impacting 35 employees that primarily work in the marketing business development and Community teams according to Ilia this is meant to consolidate the core team to focus on narrower and higher impact activities in the ecosystem as a review of the foundation's activities found that it had sometimes been moving too slowly while trying to do too many things at once despite this the near Foundation treasury is reported to still be strong and well-managed with over 285 million Fiat 305 million near tokens and 70 million of investment and loans with a leaner team and big plans near protocol is looking towards an exciting year and while we don't have time to dive into the details in this video their rope map for 2024 is focused on a few features to improve the usability scalability and decentralization of the protocol some of these include stateless validation which improves on their original Nightshade sharding design making it more scalable and a plan to provide support for account aggregation which would allow users to control accounts on different chains with just one near account there's even a collaboration with polygon to build ZK wasm a ZK Prov for wasm based blockchains and on top of that in November last year the team also launched a data availability service called near da well that was a lot to cover and as you can see the near protocol has a lot to offer especially with the integration of AI and blockchain Technology well we'll be looking forward to seeing how they can deliver on these plants let us know in the comments below what you're most excited about in the meantime make sure to like this video And subscribe to stay updated [Music],Youtube video,NEAR Protocol

compounding on the rally of Q4 last year total crypto market cap rallied by 64.5% in q1 reaching a high of 2.9 trillion on March 13th while Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high it's worth noting that the total crypto market cap is slightly shy of that achievement in absolute terms the growth of the past quarter was almost double that of Q4 202 3 having grown by 1.1 trillion this was largely driven by the approval of us spot Bitcoin ETFs in early January sending Bitcoin to a new all-time high in March Bitcoin continued to be the main beneficiary of inflows as seen by its slight uptick in dominance however since the end of q1 dominance has seen another uptick and has broken up past an important level to levels not seen since April 2021 stable coins have seen continued inflow growing by 15% or 20.6 billion in absolute terms usdc has regained a bit of its market share which had been declining over most of last year newcomer usde entered the chat breaking into the top five Stables even

quarter has been fund flow watching of us spot ETFs with Traders looking to flose as an indication of bullish or bearish momentum us spot Bitcoin ETFs held over 55 billion in funds by April 2nd after the approval of us spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC on January 10th black rocks ibit ETF has accumulated over 17 billion in Bitcoin and cemented itself as the second largest Bitcoin ETF it also had the most trading volume amongst its competitors in q1 meanwhile gray scales converted gbtc ETF ended April 2nd with 21.7 billion in AUM it experienced 6.9 billion in net outflows due to early investors taking profit and its higher fees compared to its competitors despite this it remained the largest Bitcoin ETF in q1 over on ethereum the main developments were the denin upgrade and gaining traction of reaking with the denin upgrade successfully implemented on March 13th gas fees across layer 2os were significantly reduced to only a few cents per transaction this led to a surge in activity on l2s which was 40% higher than last quarter Linea also saw a boost in activity with growing rumors of an airdrop E3 staking on igen lay also took off in the past few months with the total number of restak eth rising 36% to 4 .3 million most of this restak eth 53% were held by liquid reaking protocols totaling 2.28 million eth ethery was the largest LRT protocol of q1 with a 21% market share or 910k eth held Solana remained in the spotlight in q1 being the beneficiary of the meme coin craze on the network despite facing a 5H hour outage on February 6th almost a year since its last major outage the

billion market cap within 2 days now one interesting development in the defi sector is points trading and pre-launch markets recent months saw the emergence and rise of points programs which were tied to a Project's eluded airdrop in typical crypto fashion a market has emerged which allows users to speculate on the future value of their airdrops by enabling points trading on protocols like whales Market Traders could also directly speculate on the price of the future token on protocols like Avo and Hyper liquid which started listing pre-launch markets for tokens which had confirmed their airdrops interestingly these have had relative accuracy in predicting the opening price of the airdrop tokens nfts saw some recovery last quarter where trading volume across the top 10 marketplaces stood at 4.7 billion now this was due to revived attention on bitcoin and Solana nfts blur remained the leading nft Marketplace in q1 with over 1.5 billion in volume magic Eden gained some market

9fRuGCeThDo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fRuGCeThDo,"this recent Market rally has not been short of meme coin Mania so in this video we'll take a look at some of the top meme coins from different ecosystems do keep in mind that some of these top meme coins have a small market cap and usually exhibit substantially more volatility than your usual crypto so please do not construe the information in this video as investment advice and of course Dy yes even on Meme coins without further Ado let's look at the OG meme coin Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013 to poke fun at Bitcoin the meme coin with a Sheba enu mascot eventually gained a cult following with wild rides fueled by Wall Street bet subreddit and Elon Musk in 2021 to the similarly to bitcoin Dogecoin runs on its own decentralized blockchain that uses a proof of work consensus mechanism Dogecoin miners validate transactions on the blockchain and earn Dogecoin as block rewards that's where the similarity ends as Dogecoin has no upper limit in its Supply compared to bitcoin's finite 21 million hard cap it's also faster than the Bitcoin network with a one minute block time instead of 10 doa's inflation might make it not be the best way to store your life savings but with the current market cap of 22 billion it puts Dogecoin at the top n crypto by market cap and the top dog of meme coins inspired by Dogecoin success shibba enu entered the chat in 2020 dubbed the Dogecoin killer sedon developer roshi created shibba Inu on ethereum to not only poke fun at Dogecoin but also as an experiment in community governance according to shibs woof paper on shibat token.com roshi avoided all all forms of pre-sales and influencer Shilling which is common in other crypto projects roshi also mentioned that he got help from a friend he met in the 2019 Osaka ethereum Defcon to help provide 10 eth as liquidity for shibs liquidity pool on Unis swap in which the liquidity tokens were then burned what a noble sacrifice to further ensure a Level Playing Field for its Community Shino is also created with no special token allocations for the dev team the team bought their tokens on the open market just like everyone else as the token is launched on ethereum this enables shibba enu to launch Sheba swap its very owned decks to enable users to buy and sell shib as well as providing liquidity on the decks to earn bone the governance token for shibba enu in 2023 shibba enu launched sharum a layer 2 blockchain on ethereum that lets users pay fees with ship tokens next up up we have the meme coin that is probably taking up the most mind chair at the moment dog with hat although it seems that the Hat Dawning dog is just getting fired up the origin of the iconic image goes back four years on November 6 2019 professional fortnite gamer Issa changed his Twitter profile picture to feature a shibba Inu dog sporting a cute pink knitted hat this caught on quickly as other users and even celebrities on Twitter changed their profile picture to the image of the dog fans of the meme even made edits to the image by changing the Hat that's worn by the dog spawning countless variations and memes featuring the dog now mysteriously the original dog with hat Twitter account was suspended for reasons unknown in December 2019 but the Hat stays on and the meme eventually made its mark on Solana last November doc with hat started trading on radium on November 20th 2023 and in Just 4 months it has reached a market cap all-time high of 4.5 billion inspired by its success this meme coin has spawned endless amounts of copycats as the xwi Y formula spurred many to throw money at them in hopes of capturing just a fraction of the original meme coins success so far we've covered the two household names in the meme space as well as the upand cominging dog with hat now in case you're tired of dogs let's head over to base and take a look at Brett Brett is inspired by a character named Brett from Matt Fury's comic Boys Club if you're unfamiliar with Brett he's a dear friend of the internet icon Pepe the Frog came up with Pepe and Brett two characters given their resemblance with each other Brett is sometimes called blee the Brett token went live on Bay just slightly more than a month ago and has already reached a market cap of 517 million at the time of shooting making it by far the largest and fastest growing meme on Base According to its Twitter it was stated that they have surpassed 60,000 holders on base and currently there seems to be no shortage of support coming from its Community many see Brett having a similar trajectory as Pepe which made a splash last year on ethereum and Rose to over 3 billion in market cap this year as it stands now Brett still has a lot of ground to cover in order to cement its Legacy in the meme coin space but the early Believers of Brett will tell you that it feels good man' with meme coins popping off on Solana in base lately it seems like the folks over at the Avalanche Foundation are feeling the fomo as an effort to Spur the meme action on the Avalanche ecosystem the foundation scooped up a bunch of avax meme coins last month well given their dedication to digital culture we will give the current Flagship meme coin on Avalanche a brief honorary mention currently sitting at 280 million in market cap is enu launched in December 2023 enu is a rooster themed meme coin with a total supply of 69,420 trillion Cox with a classy name and Crown wearing rooster as its mascot it's no surprise it came onto the scene with a bang reach a market cap high of 276 million on December 20th 2023 after an 80% correction the rooster rose up again to put in a market cap all-time high of 420 million on March 13 2024 marking a 4,794 increase in price since its arrival now as meme coins come and go it's wise to keep your risk reasonable and avoid fomo WI participating in meme coins remember meme coins are supposed to be funny and not to be

edXbBr-3Xks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edXbBr-3Xks,you probably know that Bitcoin made a new all-time high at 73k slightly over a month ago now it has since seen a couple of dips down to roughly 60k or so with the recent shed attributed to escalating geopolitical tensions by the time you're watching this video though we're knocking on the door of the having so who knows what the market has done by then nevertheless this is the first time Bitcoin has made a new all-time high prior to the having you may start to hear or think that this time is different due to the introduction of us spot Bitcoin ETFs and the inflow of institutional money not to mention Hong Kong has also just approved spot Bitcoin and eth ETFs on Monday this week and while these are undoubtedly major bullish catalysts which opens access for institutions and Retail alike to pour money into the asset it does not mean that these buyers will not sell to take profit rebalance portfolios or are immune to panic selling a recent analysis has even shown that the average trade size on black Rock's ibit is 13k suggesting that the main driver of ETF buys are actually from retail investors rather than institutions I it doesn't have to be a currency runes are also one of the latest developments in the growing Bitcoin ecosystem it's essentially a new protocol and token standard for fungible tokens on bitcoin which improves on the current br rc20 standard and is created by ordinals Creator Casey rmore runes will activate exactly when the having occurs after an impressive bullish run from as early as the start of 2023 is the market finally showing signs of short to medium-term weakness let's consider some of the potential headwinds US inflation ticked higher for two consecutive months now from 3.2% in February to 3.5% in the latest report for March this means that the FED will likely not be in a rush to lower rates though they are still sticking to the plan of three Cuts this year the next fomc meeting is in May and we'll just have to see what happens between now and then some investors believe that it would be impossible for the FED to get inflation under control without triggering a recession and the New York fed puts the chances of a US recession in the next year at 58.3% something that no one seems to be talking about now is yield curve which remains inverted historically inverted yield curves have correctly predicted the last seven recessions however it's worth noting that these things can take a long time to play out as for ethereum it's been an exciting past month both good and bad it successfully rolled out its dencon hard Fork on March 13th and as promised Denon has successfully lowered gas fees on top L2 networks like arbitrum optimism Stark net and Bas whose gas fees have mostly Fallen by over 90% to about a few cents per transaction this was followed however with some unwelcome news as headlines revealed that several companies that had dealt with the ethereum foundation were facing scrutiny from the SEC a news story that has apparently gone under the radar since late February based on a commit message posted to GitHub that stated the foundation had received a voluntary inquiry from a State Authority that included a requirement for confidentiality Fortune reported that the SEC was waging a campaign to classify eth as a security little else is currently known about the scope and focus of the investigation due to the confidentiality requirements from involved parties the news had dimmed hopes for the approval of spot eth ETFs in May though Black Rock CEO Larry fin has come out to say that ethereum could still get ETFs approved even if classified as a security with the US spot ETF deadlines fast approaching in miday we'll have to see if he knows something that we don't one major development that we've been watching for weeks now is eth's relative weakness to BTC at the time of shooting since our last update eth has not only given back the gains of its previous bounce against BTC but has broken down on its long-term support level dropping to levels not seen since April 2021 this has naturally coincided with a weekly breakout on bitcoin dominance which may be a forewarning of altcoin weakness across the board as many are also starting to break down on their BTC support levels regulatory Crackdown in the US intensifies not only with the eth foundation but Unis swap which was served a Wells notice by the SEC kucoin which was charged by the doj and terraform labs and Doan convicted of fraud but on the brighter side the space continues to see traction and capital inflow as shown by the fact that Global crypto investment products have crossed $100 billion in AUM and VCS in projects which continue to raise funds as you can see a lot has happened in the past month or so to say the least but that's all the time we have to cover in this video have your normally friends or family started asking you about crypto let us

DxaolQnV5Gg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxaolQnV5Gg,Manta or as the team describes it the modular blockchain for ZK applications has emerged as one of the most trending cryptocurrencies in 2024 so far and there are various reasons for it for starters it's layer 2 quickly grew to become the fourth largest ethereum scaling solution Just 4 months after launch also on January 5th they announced an air drop scheduled for the 18th of the same month then a few days before the scheduled air drop binance made a listing announcement on D-Day however things didn't go smoothly as the network faced a Dos attack and shortly after the team was hit with money laundering allegations so yeah it has indeed been an interesting start for Mana to say the least but before delving into all of that let's explore the project in more detail beginning with the team manta's story began in 2020 with its three co-founders Victor G shumo Chu and Kenny Lee Kenny with a background in the crypto space since 2013 when he started mining Bitcoin was pursuing his MBA at MIT Sloan Victor was studying for his MERS in economics at Harvard and schuma was working at elgrand as a system researcher the three came together and founded pox Labs the development company behind Manta Network their goal was to address the issue of lack of interoperability usability and especially privacy faced by blockchains they aim to achieve this by building an interoperable and privacy Focus layer one network on polka dot the vision began to materialize in 2021 when pox Labs held its first funding round raising over 1 million from pulley chain so far they have secured over 60.4 million across five rounds with participation from other investors such as coin fund climing Venture partners and binance Labs so what is Manta Manta Network currently comprises two networks Manta Atlantic which operates as a layer one on polka dot and Manta Pacific a layer 2 builds on ethereum so let's zoom in on Manta Atlantic their first product Manta Atlantic is a layer one para of chain in the polka dot ecosystem designed with a focus on privacy and identity using ZK or zero knowledge technology being a ZK layer one chain allows them to offer projects a foundational focus on privacy and confidentiality it enables them to build their projects without the need to develop their own cryptographic Solutions on top of that Manta Atlantic is powered by other key infrastructure components such as the ZK address system designed to safeguard sensitive information this includes details about the sender receiver asset ID and and the amount involved in transactions the project has also introduced a mechanism through a feature known as the proof key this enables users to selectively share specific credentials associated with the ZK address system without disclosing their entire zero knowledge identity the purpose of the proof key is to ensure that users can meet compliance requirements like KC's without the necessity to reveal more information than strictly necessary for the given context Manta Atlantic's uniqueness lies in its approach unlike privacy Solutions such as zcash and Monero which essentially create a privacy token mantis's primary focus is on Crafting technology aimed at enhancing the privacy of other projects in other words it serves as a utility provider for privacy through ZK technology this could be achieved through their proposed decentralized Anonymous p payment here users have the ability to privatize an existing public token such as Dot and use it anonymously for payments or they can engage in private trading through a swap platform on the network Manta Pacific the sister chain functions as an optimistic rollup layer 2 Solution on the ethereum blockchain like any rollup Manta Pacific eases the load on ethereum by executing transactions offchain what sets Manta Pacific apart is that it builds upon the groundwork laid by the Manta team in ZK technology and integrates it into the ethereum virtual machine to cater to applications that want to make use of these privacy capabilities but within the ethereum ecosystem also developers can now Leverage The Power of ZK technology within the familiar ethereum environment without the need to learn new languages making ZK app development more accessible another key feature of manta Pacific is its shift of the data availability layer from ethereum to Celestia a dedicated blockchain designed to efficiently handle data for layer 2 transactions this change was implemented in a December 2023 update it aims to reduce the data portion of transaction costs for end users and Advance the L2 to its second phase according to its road map okay so now let's discuss the ecosystems utility token Manta the total supply of manta at launch is 1 billion tokens and currently about 25.1% of this total Supply equivalent to 251 million Manta tokens is already in circulation as of shooting as for token allocation 21.9% is set aside for the ecosystem 13.50% for the foundation Treasury and 10% for the team the team's tokens won't be released for the first 18 months after which there will be a grad ual release over the next 48 months advisers receive 8.10% released monthly over 30 months stakers responsible for maintaining network security receive 2% private strategic and institutional investors collectively allocated 24.11% will not have token access for the first 12 months followed by a gradual release over 36 months bance launch pool gets 3% and the remaining 12.1% is allocated to airdrops that began in January 2024 so then what about its ecosystem the Manta Atlantic ecosystem currently has 47 million in tvl according to its website it only has a few protocols such as Manta decks and bifrost decks live on the Chain While others are still in development in terms of Partnerships the layer one has collaborated with projects like Linea Dora Factory and impossible Finance these projects leverage Manta for products such as nft private offering this privately mints nfts on ZK address and ZK soulbound tokens designed for privacy oriented digital identity Manta Pacific on the other hand boasts 39 daps and a tvl of 635 million though this doesn't seem to include the 1.1 billion locked in its new paradigm campaign this probably explains the discrepancy with tvl figures from L2 beat which reports its tvl at about 2.36 billion the campaign incentivized users with an airdrop to Bridge eth and usdc to Manta Pacific and earn up to 5% in fixed yield does that sound familiar well that's because it uses a similar Playbook to blast blast the L2 that has amassed over 1 billion so far in tvl from eth and stable coin deposits from users in return for up to 5% yield and airdrop rewards mantis's campaign also provided nft incentives unlike blast users were given the option to farm for yields in their ecosystem right away with liquid tokens received in exchange for bridging their eth and usdc thanks to this campaign Manta Pacific has become one of the fastest growing ethereum L2 Solutions currently ranking as the fourth largest by tvl trailing only behind arbitrum optimism and blast just a few months after its launch moving on here's what Manta got lined up for in the future according to the Project's road map Manta Pacific is set to transition from its current status as an optimistic rollup to a ZK evm this shift involves adopting an evm compatible rollup secured by zero knowledge proofs via poly chains chain development kit a tool crafted for deploying layer 2 Solutions following this transition Manta also aims to continue reducing gas fees and expanding support for additional used cases as for Manta Atlantic Manta has not outlined a detailed road map for the layer one but their website indicates there are products in development now it's worth noting that Kenny Lee one of the co-founders shared in an interview on January 25th 2024 that the project has undergone a strategic shift St staring away from its original goals due to regulatory concerns and technological feasibility issues the project had initially aimed to explore the Privacy aspect of zero knowledge technology but has pivoted towards a focus on zero knowledge enabled decentralized applications well there you have it an overview of the Manta Network what are your thoughts on the project well feel free to share them

filings by firms including Black Rock Vanek Arc and Fidelity in today's video we'll look at some of the price predictions on eth made by notable figures are you wondering how 2024 will turn out for ethereum well Standard Charter seems to have some thoughts on the matter drawing from the previous approved spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10th and that ethereum similarly to bitcoin has Futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Standard Charter expects a similar approval process for spot ethereum ETFs standard chartered's head of digital assets research predicts ethereum spot ETF applications to be approved by the SEC on May 23rd the deadline for the ETF ruling Kendrick expects eth to climb up to $4,000 by May 23rd 2024 following bitcoin's price action going into its ETF approval date this prediction however hinges on Market belief on approval being low and that the SEC approves multiple applications at once similar to the 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 10th what's interesting however is that Kendrick expects ethereum to avoid the post ETF approval dump as seen with Bitcoin Bitcoin dropped as much as 20% after the ETF approval when billions of shares of the grayscale Bitcoin trust or gbtc were sold as investors were looking for funds with better fees resulting in more than 3.3 billion in gbtc outflows because gray skills ethereum trust controls a smaller amount of e than its total market cap compared to gbtc Kendrick believes this makes ethereum more resilient than Bitcoin in the face of a post ETF approval selloff next up let's look at what the

eth valuations which is based on cash flow projections on ethereum's Revenue the report introduces the concept of ethereum as a digital Mall hosting businesses made with smart contract code where users interact through their crypto wallet as ethereum is not actually a business revenue is derived from transaction fees specifically the base fee and tip fee that users pay for a plethora of actions on ethereum the report also looks into transaction fees that users pay when interacting with daps spanning various sectors such as defi metaverse gaming and infrastructure after estimating the revenue that ethereum makes from the economic activity on its blockchain cash flow projections are made to predict ethereum's Revenue by the year 2030 after taking into account of eth's tokenomics and fully diluted valuation van e analysts were able to make three predictions on eth's price by the year 2030 the base scenario is $1,848 per eth by 2030 assuming ethereum becomes the leading global settlement Network hosting a good portion of of commercial activity from business sectors that benefit from blockchain technology the more optimistic 2030 bull case scenario predicts a 51,000 eth and conversely the 2030 be case calls for a $343 e JP Morgan's managing director Nicolas notes the upcoming Cancun upgrade as a major Catalyst for ethereum's performance for 2024 the Cancun upgrade which is scheduled bu on March 2024 implements Proto den sharding and increases ethereum transaction throughput and reduces gas fees JP Morgan's analysts predict ether to outperform Bitcoin in 2024 and reach $8,000 by 20126 crypto veterans will need no introduction to co-founder and former CEO of bidm Arthur Hayes in mid December 2023 Hayes admitted on Twitter that he had received a word from the Lord telling him to ditch his soul bags and profess his love for Archangel falic by loading up on eth while calling for a $5,000 e now this is interesting because Hayes has previously tweeted about his bullish stance on Solana at the beginning of December you would be right to think that $5,000 is too conservative of a price Target coming from a figure like Arthur Hayes in November 2023 Arthur Hayes tweeted that he received received a message from the ancestors in Easter Island that the bull market starts in November 2023 and then calls for not only a 1 million Bitcoin but also eth to hit 100K Arthur Hayes however is not the only person in town giving out bold price predictions for crypto known for her bullish outlook on crypto the CEO of Arc invest Kathy Wood predicts that the entire crypto sector will experience dramatic growth over the next 5 to 7even years we are on the threshold of uh an explosion in Innovation with its market cap going from 1 trillion to 25 trillion now it's also worth mentioning that arc's ETF arm 21 shares which has previously filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF that has since been approved has just amended their spot ethereum ETF filing on February 7th as for Kathy Wood's price target for E she calls for a 166k e by 2032 with its market cap exceeding 20 trillion now for reference bitcoin's current market cap is just North of 900 billion her reason for this bold projection is her belief that ethereum plays a crucial role in revolutionizing the finance sector through its Defi and nft ecosystem she also posits that ethereum could outperform Bitcoin over

qmw5DorMr6E,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmw5DorMr6E,have you already heard of dein while it's not exactly a New Concept the sector has lately been regaining some interest it might be because it's using crypto and blockchain to make technology and services more available to everyone in the real world so stay tuned because in today's video we're exploring deepin its potential its challenges and the future ahead if you're not already familiar with deepin let us break down for you so dpin is short for decentralized physical infrastructure Network it uses blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to encourage the building and upkeep of realworld infrastructure think of it like a ride sharing service where anyone with a car can sign up as a driver to earn cash except now it's on the blockchain with that there's a chance for better ways to motivate people there's more transparency and making things Easier by cutting out costly middleman some of these physical infrastructures include Wi-Fi hotspots solar powered systems cloud services and transportation networks individuals can deploy hardware and offer services to others in these areas the main driving force of deepin is to create a decentralized people- owned Network that provides a more cost effective and Innovative service than the traditional models that were used to tokens are used to encourage participation from individuals and organizations to collectively build a great product participants can pay for services earn for providing services and stake tokens to vote in the case where the token rewards also represent ownership and governance rights okay so when you look at deepin from afar there are two broad categories so the first one is physical resource networks prns so these are location-based physical resource networks in this type of network providers can contribute Hardware resources related to connectivity Mobility energy and similar sectors so these resources are location based and sometimes fixed to a specific location so think of wireless geospatial and sensor based projects they all fall under prns on the other hand we have digital resource networks so these rely on digital resource providers to contribute computing power shared bandwidth or storage facilities in comparison to prns these networks are not set to a location and can include cloud storage Geographic mapping and data sharing projects are you launching the next cuttingedge crypto project and in need of crypto Market data look no further coin gecko API is the world's most reliable accurate and comprehensive cryptocurrency data AP for Traders and developers why build price feeds from scratch when you can access crypto nft and on chainex data directly from coin gecko API get realtime crypto Market data such as price trading volume market capitalization metadata onchain liquidity data and more from 70 plus end points with just a few API calls help your end users discover the market momentum quickly and easily coin Geo API is used and trusted by by thousands of Industry leaders and projects including metamask ether scan chain link and more sign up for your one month free trial today apply code cgtv at checkout to redeem your complimentary month when you zoom in closer to the different categories of deepin projects can be classified into six categories which are Computing wireless energy AI services and sensing now you might be wondering what are some of these projects using dpin well let's dive right into it okay so the first one is filecoin so filecoin is a project that operates as a peer-to-peer Network that stores files users can pay for data storage and distribution services or get paid for storing other users files in their native token fil another deepend project that everyone's talking about is helium helium is a distributed network of hotspots that create public long range wireless coverage participants are compensated in h&t the native cryptocurrency of the helium blockchain if you're on the lookout for a new map of the world Hive mapper is here for you the project makes maps of the world by having participants use a dash cam to take images as they drive when members successfully contribute to making the map useful they are given honey tokens which can also be redeemed to access Hive mappers map data to round up our list of examples is fetch.ai a project that aims to democratize access to AI technology with a permissionless network anyone can build and deploy autonomous AI agents that can perform tasks like optimizing defi trading Services managing Transportation networks and facilitating smart energy grids the native token Fe is used to pay for services and transaction fees okay so it sounds like pin has a lot up its sleeve when it comes to providing real world applications but just how successful is it well according to a report by Masari and EV3 in 2023 the dpin ecosystem grew to over 650 projects across the six Subs sectors with more than 20 billion in market cap and over 15 million in Revenue because deepin revenues are anchored in utility rather than speculation the Eco e system is also more resilient when facing crypto Market fluctuations the same report noted that during the last Market cycle deepin onchain revenues fell between 20 to 60% while the rest of crypto fluctuated between 70 to 90% looking at this year the deepin market cap concluded the first week of February at 13 billion so what is the real potential of deepin with deepin horizontal scalability is easier to manage because networks can increase resources instead of the capacity of each resource this enables the system to easily scale in and out depending on demand other than that dpin is also decentralizing infrastructure systems and moving from corporations to a collective of individuals who can commit their resources with this system the facility's control is distributed to the different providers and everyone has control relative to their capacity by having individuals contribute their resources deep in networks are also more cost efficient and spend little to no cost in bringing the network to Life Services are delivered with high quality for the least possible cost of course deepin is not spared from challenges that might limit its progression first deepin as a concept could be hard to grasp with daunting technical asp aspects that might put off any potential participants projects will need to be able to effectively communicate with providers and users at different levels deepin is also still fairly new with only a small percentage of enthusiasts and Facility Owners as part of the system the ecosystem will need to design a system that can attract a sufficient number of providers and users to power the network so that brings us to the third challenge which is that deepin will need to attract providers by giving rewards that are at least equal to the running cost while also remaining profitable the future of deepin looks promising and many enthusiasts are already looking at what other Technologies can contribute to the success of the ecosystem AI technology and the use of deepen are growing in popularity as calls for the democratization of AI continue to rise other than that we might see deep in utilizing zero knowledge technology because this can enhance privacy and Security in the network especially in data sharing identity management and transaction privacy and then lastly we can also see gaming used as a way to incentivize participation in the network through gamified missions that allow players to earn rewards for participating all right that's all we have for you today on deepin be sure to keep a lookout for how the space will continue continue to grow and also of course subscribe if you want to stay updated on all things crypto [Music] bye,Youtube video,Crypto In The Physical World??

9wTyVKzXVm0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wTyVKzXVm0,"blockchains are finding their way into all types of use cases in our day-to-day lives zebu our generous sponsor for this video is one such project working on using blockchains to streamline the Telecommunications sector stay tuned to find out how it works and what it's all about zebu is a web3 Neo bang for telecoms creating a unified payment ecosystem focused on streamlining the settlement experience of Telecom carriers leveraging blockchain Tech and smart contracts users can deploy verify and pay invoices on chain while instantly obtaining Loyalty Rewards from each transaction but why do we need a blockchain for the Telecommunications sector to understand how Zebo works and the problem it aims to solve we first have to introduce a specific area of the Telecommunications sector which is the Telecom wholesale industry the Telecom wholesale industry industry involves the bulk buying and selling of voice data and messaging services between Telecom carriers and service providers this industry is the backbone which allows for Global Communication to be economical efficient scalable and seamless Between Borders as it enables Telecom carriers to expand their coverage without having to invest heavily in physical infrastructure or staff however the problem is that the indust indry is plagued by several challenges including inefficient processes involving intermediaries and manual interventions long remittance delays lack of transparency Revenue laws due to currency exchange and high costs all of these challenges lead to revenue loss for industry players the industry also lacks realtime data analytics which hinders carriers and operators for making datadriven decisions affecting their operational efficiency on top of that the industry is exposed to several security threats including fraudulent activities and cyber attacks leading to significant losses for businesses so zebu thus aims to be the secure unified settlement platform designed to address these challenges the zebu network is powered by its native token zbu a loyalty utility token based on ethereum and the binance smart chain that fuels the zebu plat platform for customers and Merchants but more on the zbu token later since zebo's beta launch in August 2023 the platform has settled invoices totaling over 750 million in value it has onboarded over 300 Telecom carriers and partnered with several industry leaders such as BBT voice limited Broadband Telecom Bridge voice slovenia's Novatel pyo Telecom aisal fze and katama so how do does zebu work under the hood and why are some Telecom carriers making the switch zebo's architecture consists of four layers the uiux layer the payment service provider or PSP layer the blockchain layer and the backend layer the function of the uiux layer is as you'd expect to create a secure visually appealing and intuitive application which combines the best of both web 2 and web 3 features next the PSP layer also includes four key components the wallet exchange or swap Gateway kyc and AML and invoice settlement the PSP wallet makes use of Industry standard 256bit encryption and multisig Tech to keep assets safe the exchange or swap Gateway is the core of the PSP layer to perform quick and secure settlement and Redemption of zbu in usct there's also a secure Fiat gate way for on and off ramping multiple Fiat currencies for zbu and USD allowing Merchants to easily accept payments in their preferred currency the kyc AML component ensures security and Regulatory Compliance for identity verification and fraud prevention lastly the invoice settlement layer is used to push transactions and settlements on chain and distribute Loyalty Rewards once transaction settlement is completed it's backend onchain infrastructure is developed to handle large volumes of transactions while being scalable and reliable next the blockchain layer forms the Bedrock of zebo's operations providing a decentralized and transparent infrastructure leveraging smart contracts for instant onchain invoice settlements the Zebo platform is built on BMB smart chain finally the offchain backend layer forms an equally crucial component now without getting too technical this layer ensures robust data security seamless user authentication with single sign on efficient data storage and retrieval and effective recovery and security measures for various scenarios such as transaction failures fraud prevention and backup and Disaster Recovery there's also features which allow for the automated and scheduled execution of recurring tasks enhancing the efficiency of the platform's operations zebu incorporates two parallel layers one on the blockchain and another on the backend database for transaction backup and Recovery the back end is fully encrypted ensuring the data is safe and not directly accessible by anyone this creates a unique blend of web 2 and web 3 technology the platform thus has the potential to solve the pain points of the Telecom wholesale industry by providing a secure transparent and efficient Marketplace for Telecom businesses the zbu Loyalty utility token is designed to introduce a businesso business loyalty program and revolutionized settlements for the global Telecom industry the zbu token is a multi-chain token built on ethereum as an erc2 and pegged on BNB smart chain as B20 allowing it to be interoperable between the two networks the primary use case of this token is to ensure a coste effective fast and transparent mechanism of transaction settlement and offer Loyalty Rewards to zebu ecosystem Partners zbu tokens are used by merchants and customers for invoice settlement it will also act as a payment processor fee roughly being 1% of the value of each invoice zbu will also be used as Loyalty Rewards for users of the platform for each successful invoice settled both merchants and customers each receive up to 1.25% of the invoice value in zbu aside from Loyalty Rewards zbu is also used to reward participation in governance acting as an additional incentive for token holders who contribute towards the Network's decision making as for its Supply and distribution zbu has a maximum supply of 5 billion 10% is reserved for the private sale 7.4% for liquid tokens on the market 6% to the team and advisors 4% for the founders 20% for zbu labs 25% for settlement and Loyalty Rewards 15% for the treasury 5% for zbu club and 8% for token Burns according to their white paper a total of$ 369 million tokens were released as the initial circulating Supply to supply liquidity on decentralized and centralized exchanges 2023 was a big year for zeu marking significant Milestones the platform had successfully processed over 6,000 invoices valuing over 500 million on boarded over 320 Telecom carriers and raised 25 million in their pre-sale funding in 2024 the team has already shipped new improvements such as an update to its PSP which includes the integration of the zeu PSP governance model this is one step towards its goal of decentralizing the platform as we look to the Future zebu continues to research and build with a focus on enhancing user experience forging new Partnerships and expanding their services to meet the evolving needs of Telecom businesses if you've learned something new

Tp6BpG8Ae5Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp6BpG8Ae5Q,"you may have heard of injective protocol thanks to its native token inj it has been on an absolute tear since the beginning of last year ending 2023 with a whopping 29 times gain it has not only surpassed its 2021 all-time high but also emerged as the best performing asset among the top 100 cryptocurrencies in 2023 well almost as it was outperformed by a dog on Solana so without further Ado Let's Get Down to What all this Buzz around injective is all about the project so far has raised 57 million over five rounds of funding from notable investors such as Finance Labs jump crypto panta capital and Mark Cuban besides that injective also launched its 150 million ecosystem initiative supported by influential players such as pentti capital c coin Ventures jump crypto and Deli labs this initiative is to bootstop developers to create a diverse ecosystem on the protocol inductive labs co-founders are no slouch either CEO Eric Chen from New York University and CTO Albert Chan a Stanford Graduate joined hands to work on injective for at least 2 years before they conducted their first major round of funding in 2020 which raised 2.6 million so what is injective well injective is a decentralized cosmos based layer one blockchain it focuses on powering defi applications it uses tender's proof of State consensus mechanism and because of that it's able to acheve achieve a blazingly fast block time of 0.8 seconds now this is supposedly able to handle 10,000 transactions per second while keeping transaction fees under a penny injective also uses the inter blockchain communication standard or IBC and IBC enables decentralized communication between independent blockchains this allows for various cross-chain applications such as bridging tokens deployment of cross-chain daps or iCal data fees and it does this while mitigating counterparty risk that comes with centralized Bridges as a result injective is highly interoperable with other blockchains like Cosmos Solana polygon as well as ethereum after implementing an erc20 token bridge but the two main things that sets injective apart from other leo1 blockchains are a decentralized onchain order book and auto executing smart contracts at its core injective features is a decentralized Mev resistant onchain order book so maximal extractable value is a prevalent issue in the blockchain space usually associated with ethereum now to briefly explain me refers to Miners and validators taking advantage of pending transactions in a blockchain's menol they can do this by including excluding or reordering transactions and this can lead to unfair Fair trading conditions average blockchain users are then at risk of front running and sandwich attacks but injective bypasses this by implementing an onchain order book that uses frequent batch auction or FBA FBA is a novel order matching mechanism that promotes tighter spreads eliminates front running and so improves liquidity provisioning because of this it creates a more Equitable trading environment as the order book is built into the blockchain As A Primitive applications built on injective can tap into the liquidity of a shared onchain order book and this resolves many problems faced by dex's one such is fragmented liquidity across various platforms which causes market inefficiencies and poor exchange rates the order book is also flexible supporting different types of trading markets like spot Futures and options injectives unique implementation of C os's km WM smart contract framework enables Auto executing smart contracts now without getting into the weeds with its technicalities Auto executing smart contracts allow smart contract functions to be triggered automatically at every block without external intermediaries such as users or external oracles this opens up the possibilities for new use cases for smart contracts such as black panthers automated trade in strategies that are executed entirely on chain so considering injective technology and the 150 million ecosystem initiative how is their ecosystem shaping up well according to defi Lama tbll on incus climbed up to 81 million at the time of shooting with 14 daps making up for this TV almost 90% of this tvl is from three daps Dojo swap an amm Dex Helix an order book Dex developed by in labs and black panther an automated yield farming protocol as promising as injective seems to be its current 81 million tvl ultimately pales in comparison with that of other leading dexes such as dydx which currently has a tvl of 375 million or Solana tvl of 4.7 billion comprising over 100 active dos in the recent couple of months daily trading volume ranged from 3 to 43 million compared to chains like Solana arbitrum or dydx which are easily doing several hundred million up to 2 billion volume per day evidently injective still has a lot of ground to cover in order to be the leading D5 Focus layer one and has a lot of competition now let's take a look at the token powering injective inj so at Genesis inj Supply starts at 100 million inj with an inflation targeted at 7% that tapers over time to 2% inj acts as the network utility token used to pay for fees staking for network security and is also used for onchain governance for things like protocol upgrades and New Market listings on exchanges injective is also offering its token as an incentive for early users participating in trades on the protocol on top of that users stand the chance to earn additional inj based on how profitable their trades are one distinct feature of inj as a utility token is capturing revenue generated from any dexes operating on injective which collect an exchange or swap fee dominated in inj for every trade executed for instance 0.01% to 0.02% on Helix there are two ways for anyone to capture this Revenue targeted at developers the first first way is by hosting an exchange relayer node so this essentially creates a new exchange that routes trades into the injectives shared order book to cater to a specific local or niche in the market this is meant to incentivize different exchanges to compete in order to provide new and better user experiences for users expanding the ecosystems reach by serving more defi users as a result as an exchange relayer one could expect to earn a large share of the exchange fees that goes through their application at 40% the second way to capture the remaining 60% of the exchange revenue is for any inj holder to participate in exchange fee auctions where the 60% of Revenue accured by injective daps is used to buy back and burn inj tokens on a monthly basis basically collected fees are auctioned to the public every month where they can bid inj tokens to buy The aggregated inj Exchange fees essentially allowing people to buy inj at a discount the proceeds of the auction will then be burned this Burning mechanism is a contributor in ij's potential deflationary tokenomics ij's deflationary potential is heavily tied to the traffic on exchanges on injective through the aformentioned exchange fee auctions while injective claims that this will produce one of the largest burn ratios in the crypto space inj will still need sustained demand for injectives ecosystem in order to achieve and maintain deflation this alone doesn't guarantee a deflationary token but it would have a decent chance of getting there if the network continues to grow over time as for in J's token allocation fundraising from seed binance Launchpad and Private Sales account for 32% of the token Supply 20% is allocated to the team and the rest 46% goes towards ecosystem growth it's worth noting that all inj tokens are unlocked and in circulation with the last 4% vested inj tokens unlocked recently on January 21st overall injective has a solid core team decent backing from key players a product with a proven use case a modest but growing ecosystem and robust tokenomics now while it looks poised to be one of the more promising projects within the space it is still important to keep in mind the hype surrounding the project and remember that the market can turn any time so what are your thoughts on injective do you think it will emerge as a top trading and defi focused L1 or will it be its other competitors let us know down in the comments if

6M5yOCPO4oU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M5yOCPO4oU,"right before the turn of the Year vitalic graced the crypto Community with the long awaited road map for ethereum in 2024 now before you get your hopes up too high he did preface by saying that the road map remains pretty much the same from last year still there are some very interesting tidbits ahead now no matter if you're an eight brained Jen or a DieHard eth Maxi trust me you'll want to stick around and find out what's next for our beloved Mother Ship now before before we dive into the nitty bitty details let's refresh our memories on the six core components of ethereum's upcoming Focus so there's the merge The Surge The Scourge The Verge The Purge and the Splurge a large part of the merge as we know already happened in September 2022 when the ethereum main net finally merged with the beacon chain and fully transitioned from proof of work to proof of stake since then the focus has shifted to single slot finality but more on this later the surge as its name suggests aims to hit a throughput of 100,000 transactions per second and Beyond this will be one of the key components to making the network much more scalable and Speedy The Scourge focuses on mitigating centralization and other risks associated with meev previously vitalic has called for a more credibly neutral consensus layer as miners have been known to front run and exploit transactions to their favor validating blocks should be super simple and The Verge aims to make this a reality making this process easy for validators opens the door to a wider variety of network participants making ethereum more decentralized scalable and healthy The Purge is designed to improve the usability and functionality of ethereum by eliminating technical debt and limiting Network participation cost last but not least the Splurge serves as the catchall for the other five road map components ensuring that all other elements critical to ethereum's growth are covered okay so now that we're familiar with the ethereum RO map on a high level let's take a closer look at some of the key updates in 2024 though we won't be diving into anything too technical in this video since eum's transition to POS single slot finality or ssf have has been the main focus to strengthen ethereum's consensus design currently ethereum now takes between 64 and 95 slots to finalize blocks making it vulnerable to potential reorgs and other me risks so ssf enhances the efficiency of ethereum's consensus mechanism by enabling blocks to be proposed and finalized within the same slot reducing transaction latency are you launching the next cuttingedge crypto project and in need of crypto Market data look no further coin gecko API is the world's most reliable accurate and

code cgtv at checkout to redeem your complimentary month now Under The Surge significant process has also been made on EIP 4844 as well as rollups themselves EIP 4844 also known as Proto sharding will drastically reduce the cost of posting L2 rollup data to ethereum main net via blobs using this new transaction type allows rollup sequencers and potentially others to post data to the main net more cheaply than currently possible moving forward cross rollup standards and interoperability are highlighted as the key areas for long-term improvements according to vitalic this area is where the denen upgrade comes in which we'll talk about more in just a bit then the scourge has shifted its focus somewhat compared to the previous year currently instead of just focusing on me risk it also includes fighting economic centralization from General Stak pooling issues meanwhile as for the Verge significant process has been made according to vitalic veral trees are close to being ready validating blocks will involve downloading only a few bytes of data and this process will also include performing some basic calculations and verifying succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge or snark all this will help make ethereum more compatible with a ZK evm future now let's get back to denin the ethereum Cancun denb or dankan upgrade is a much anticipated hard Fork that is expected in the first quarter of 2024 though the different phases of the road map are somewhat independent and being worked on simultaneously the ethereum denin is the current focus it marks the beginning of the surge era which aims to introduce several important eips to scalability security and usability this includes EIP 4844 or Proto sharding like I mentioned before EIP 2322 which introduces an upgrade to the POS consensus algorithm which makes it more robust and efficient and then EIP 1153 which is designed to introduce a new mechanism for handling temporary or transient storage during the execution of smart contracts and many more now at the time of shooting the denan upgrade has been successfully deployed on all ethereum test Nets including gurly sepolia and heski this also marks gle's final inclusion in the testing program as the network is set to be retired as the denin upgrade is now scheduled for March 13th it'll probably be out by the time that you're watching this video now there are several other upgrades for ethereum in 2024 that are set to make the network faster better and cheaper some of the most anticipated proposals that I didn't mention yet include ERC 4337 and ERC 6900 which deal with account abstraction or smart accounts when this is completed it will be a massive quality of life Improvement for the end user and it'll reduce transaction costs and ensure security of social logins then there's also EIP 478 8 which proposes to integrate the beacon block route into each evm block this allows it to obtain realtime accurate Updates this helps to minimize the need for trust and potential points of failure in external oracles next is EIP 5656 which introduces a new OP code named M Copy to dictate various operations it'll optimize the process of copying data in memory during the execution of smart contracts 2024 promises to be a big year for ethereum and its road map update highlights the blockchain's adaptability and a strong Vision that focuses on

73qwetYEwtU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73qwetYEwtU,"today we're holding up the magnifying glass to another optimistic layer 2 rollup that's been catching a lot of interest the mantle network with all the layer 2 projects popping up nowadays let's take a look at what differentiates it from the rest first let's take a quick look at the Project's early days mantle was started by bid Dow a dow launched by the centralized exchange by bit with the vision to support and Empower builders in February 2023 a proposal was was submitted by the mantle core team on bit Dow's governance Forum aiming to establish a 200 million fund 100 million from bid Dow Treasury and the other 100 million from external investors including panta Capital Spartan qcp capital and dragonfly Capital this fund is to be deployed within the mantle ecosystem over the next 3 years to contribute towards ecosystem growth in May 2023 a proposal for the mantle network and bitow to re Rebrand under mantle was passed with an overwhelming 235 million bit voting for and only 988 bit voting against the goal was to apply the one brand one token principle and produce a unified ecosystem brand with a product Focus through the Rebrand the initial rollup component of the ecosystem became officially known as the mantle Network while bitow rebranded to mantle governance the core team behind mantle is a group of dedicated individuals including key members Ben zauo the CEO and co-founder of bybit and Jordy Alexander Chief Alchemist of mantle like all other optimistic l2s mantle Network seamlessly integrates with the ethereum virtual machine allowing transactions to be offloaded from the main net what's different about mantle is that it features a module or architecture that combines optimistic rollups with an enhanced data availability solution through igen layer as you probably already know optimistic Roll-Ups group trans transactions into batches to be submitted to the ethereum main net reducing load and gas fees if you need a refresher on rollups well then check out our previous accer on them right here are you launching the next cuttingedge crypto project and in need of crypto Market data look no

gamechanging feature here is Igan da the first service built on igen layer it's a decentralized hyperscale data availability layer secured by ethereum instead of posting transaction data straight onto the ethereum main net posts it on Igan da simply explained this reduces the computational load on ethereum Main net by separating out the data portion of the transaction which is then secured by ethereum validators securing Igan da8 this approach enables it to inherit ethereum security while at the same time offering significant gas savings that'll make your transactions up to 70% cheaper aside from that mantle also features another core product their mantle liquid with staking protocol but we'll get more into this later mantle was hard at work in 2023 with a few key updates and expansions happening in July the mantle Network main net went live we're launching our main net so that's a very exciting event giving developers and users access to an ecosystem of mayet daps and tools including the mayet bridge explore and safe multi- the launch of mantel inaugural nft collection titled citizens of mantle in collaboration with internationally renowned visual artist Chen man gave approximately 38,000 users the chance to acquire their mantle compion towards the end of 2023 mantle rolled out the mantle liquid staking protocol this permissionless non-custodial eth liquid staking protocol on ethereum L1 lets you earn some serious yield by staking your eth the protocol made waves at the time of filming boasting over 521 million in total value locked and a whopping 26,758 e Stak now let's talk about the one token of mantle the MNT token is an erc20 token that's used as a governance and utility token within the mantle ecosystem giving holders voting rights to actively participate in Dow voting as well as pay for gas fees on top of that it can also serve as a second collateral asset for ethereum validators who are powering Igan da adding to the security and and stability of the network MNT has a maximum supply of just over 6.2 billion tokens and at the time of this video over 3.1 billion of these are in circulation with a market cap of 2 billion then there's mantle staked ether meth which serves as the value accumulating receipt token of Mantle's liquid staking protocol the team aims to have meth become the most widely adopted and capital efficient eth staking token which is why it's being adopted Ed and integrated across multiple mantle L2 defi applications and core technology Partners as well as centralized exchanges the concept for meth came from Jordy Alexander drawing similarities to Lido's liquid ethereum staking Alexander knows that the mantle liquid staking protocol is a lighter weight more modern Lio and hopes to attract users who are concerned over excessive Lio centralization how is it different than Lio I would say like the the design is first of all um simpler more modern we need to look at where Lido came from they came from a a pre proof of stake World a lot of the designs for things like rocket pool and and Lio they had to take into consideration you know this previous world and then merge and I know it's a very complicated difficult design I've seen all the diagrams and and and it's kind of intense me eth will work just fine on the ethereum mayet and Alexander stressed that it is an independent product from the mantle Network the other recent L launched token is musd which is an exclusive rebasing wrapped version of Ono finances yield bearing stable coin usdy that is meant to maintain a consistent Peg to $1 the introduction of musd and usdy on mantle network is a collaborative effort between mantle and Ando Finance to provide users with direct access to realworld US Treasury yield with interest being distributed through the rebasing musd token as we journey into the new year mantle has quite a few exciting things lined up for us mantle has introduced the new mantle Network V2 testnet sapoia users and developers can now access the sapoia testnet to check out the new network bridge Explorer and faucet in action it has seamless compatibility with optimism's OP stack and enjoys the benefits of the Bedrock upgrade such as enhanced stability new security features and performance impr improvements in mantle V2 the MNT token has changed from an erc2 based scheme to one that uses ether gas as a way to move closer to ethereum's Native design allowing for a more natural integration into the ethereum ecosystem mantle V2 is also introducing meta transactions to facilitate the payment of transaction fees and provide a more flexible and smooth experience this lets users interact with daps without paying for gas fees or waiting for transaction confirmations next up mantle intends to continue developing new offerings and use cases for the MNT me and musd tokens to include more options for staking and more the network is also preparing to welcome Athena's delta neutral synthetic dollar usde which doesn't rely on traditional banking infrastructure and can leverage liquidity from centralized and decentralized exchanges this will be Athena's first cross-chain deployment and a said to be widely adopted across mantle L2 applications well there you have it an overview of the mantle project how it's started and what lies ahead if you enjoyed this

6fzBZHaj59Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fzBZHaj59Y,"the Bitcoin having event is right around the corner estimated to happen on April 21st 2024 and historically prior having have coincided pretty closely with when Bitcoin kicks off on another Bull Run and this expectation of bitcoin's price increase after a having is perhaps one of the main reasons why the having event gets so much attention with another having fast approaching what can we expect in terms of bitcoin's price movement okay let's first have a quick refresher on the importance of the Bitcoin having if you don't know what a Bitcoin having is we suggest you to pause this video watch our quick explainer on it before continuing but simply explained every four years or so the Bitcoin rewards that miners receive for maintaining and securing the blockchain is slash by half hence the name the having is important because it brings forth the reduction in fresh Bitcoin Supply this has a major impact on miners as their Bitcoin Revenue gets literally cut in half barring the event that electricity costs dropped to zero this means that the price of Bitcoin has to be high enough to continue supporting profitable mining forcing miners to evaluate the viability of their operations now while prior to acknowledge that the having simply results in less Bitcoin being issued and does not directly cause Bitcoin to increase in price for that to happen demand for the asset has to stay the same or increase now while no one knows what's going to happen after the 2024 having there may be some clues that we can look for from the previous Bitcoin having events so far there have been three Bitcoin hings which at a glance have all coincided with a rally in price besides that that each market cycle had found its bottom around 11 to 15 months before each having and a cycle top around 1 to two years after the having now let's take a closer look at how bitcoin's price performed around the first having which occurred on November 28th 2012 we'll first start by looking at how Bitcoin performed 365 days before the having and the subsequent rally to its cycle high after the having 365 days before for the having bitcoin's price was at 2.54 pretty much the bottom of the 2011 downtrend as the having approached bitcoin's price recovered and reached a peak of $15 on 17th of August 2012 putting in a 56% gain from a year preab this is immediately followed by a Swift and dramatic 50% correction before price Consolidated into the having event a month after the having Bitcoin embarked on a rally lasting about 365 days topping out at $1,242 on November 29th 2013 marking a whopping 10,0 58% gain since the having event it's worth pointing out that Bitcoin had also experienced a painful 81% dump in the better earlier half of this post having rally and spent most of the time afterwards consolidating before the final runup to the 2013 cycle top are you launching the next cuttingedge crypto project and in need of

having which occurred on July 9th 2016 365 days pre having bitcoin's price sat at $269 followed by a crash on August 18th 2015 where the price of Bitcoin fell by 37% in just one day marking the bottom of the 2014 to 2015 bare Market its price then recovered and rallied before reaching a local top on November 4th 2015 which was followed by a 40% correction over the next 2 weeks after that Bitcoin Consolidated for more than 6 months before rallying again as the having Drew near forming its 2016 yearly high at $790 before experiencing a near 30% correction this marked a$1 193% increase from a year before the having shortly after the having Bitcoin further corrected by another 31% over the next month before rallying for a year and a half eventually Bitcoin put in a cycle to top of $1,847 2017 a $2,869 increase 526 days after the having though not without numerous 30% plus Corrections along the way okay on to the third having which took place on May 11th 2020 a year before the having bitcoin's price was at $7,250 while rallying from the bare Market low since since December 2018 in June 2019 Bitcoin made its preh having year high rather early at $ 13,871 which is a 115% gain from a year preh having at $ 7,215 this is Then followed by a downtrend that lasted into 2020 the year 2020 started with a relief rally but as Co developed into a crisis across the globe Bitcoin fell by 62% about 3 months before the having after that Bitcoin had mostly recovered from the co Black Swan event by the time the having took place posst having Bitcoin had mostly moved sideways before rallying in the later half of 2020 like the last having the rally had numerous Corrections though less steep with most Corrections wiping out no more than 30% of gains there is however one notable correction that is perhaps memorable to some of you where Bitcoin tumbled 50% in May 2021 after Bitcoin recovered it rallied again in the later half of 2021 eventually putting in its cycle top and all-time high of around $69,000 in November 2021 a 687 gain for a rally that lasted 548 days post having looking at the previous in the preh having year and subsequently rallies within the year after the having however correlation does not imply causation it would be wise to remember that demand is key for Bitcoin to Rally after the reduction of Bitcoin Supply as a result of the having event besides zooming out we can also observe that bitcoin's historic performance is also correlated with other risk on assets When comparing bitcoin's performance with the S&P 500 Index the two can be seen rallying in tandem with one another in fact the last three Bitcoin combined with the approval of numerous us spot Bitcoin ETFs has the potential to elevate demand and interest in Bitcoin as a credible investment however we should keep in mind that the fed's decision on interest rates in the near future will be pivotal to bitcoin and other risk assets performance as it impacts how risk on or off investors are inclined to be so far the FED has yet to announce a rate cut after pausing its rate hikes in June last year though the FED expects at least three raid cuts to start sometime in 2024 and even so it's worth noting that rate Cuts don't immediately indicate that a bullish rally is to immediately arrive as rate Cuts have historically coincided with short to medium-term downtrends as it signals a weaker economy and the effect on markets typically lack behind changes in monetary policy and remember don't bet the farm on bitcoin just because of the having as past performance is not indicative of

o_uvcmVXLAE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_uvcmVXLAE,a new year means new opportunities new projects new tokens and new ideas the year is full of possibilities but of course some will stand out more than others in today's video we're taking a look at some of the narratives and Trends to keep an eye out for this year 2023 was a big year for layer 2s but it looks like 2024 might be the year for them to really shine with the ability to improve speed reduce transaction costs and scale transaction processing and overall throughput l2s work in different ways to bring a smoother crypto experience for everyone among the l2s that are continuing to gain traction and attention mantle polygon arbitrum and optimism might be the ones on everyone's lips ethereum is set to see a crucial upgrade the EIP 4844 also known as Proto dank sharding which aims to make L2 transactions as cost effective as possible for users by introducing producing a new transaction type and further improvements the new transaction type will allow for the integration of a few features like expiring transactions batch transactions and meta transactions as an integral part of ethereum's ongoing development and transaction to a more scalable and costeffective infrastructure Proto sharding is setting the stage for l2s this year we can never have too many airdrops now can we some of the upcoming airdrops to keep an eye on on are scroll Network Stark net ZK sync and rabby wallet we might also witness a surge in airdrops in the Solana ecosystem from protocols without tokens yet many are expecting air drops from protocols like margin fi Camino and drift with more airdrops anticipated for the year we will likely see an uprise in activity on the different blockchains as users carry out transactions and interact with protocols to try and qualify for the airdrops this this is another big one to anticipate in 2024 reaking with staking tokens are locked for a set period and essentially just sit there collecting yield but that also means you lose out on your liquidity reaking wants to put liquidity back in your wallets through an Innovative solution liquid raking tokens were introduced by Igan layer to represent an eth or eth liquid staking token and the corresponding rewards think of it as a pyramid where the top layer represents your initial staking amount the second layer is the LSD which represents your staked amount and its rewards and the bottom is the LRT which is what you receive when you stake your LST and can get more rewards the value of your assets grows in size as it trickles down the pyramid the most prominent and well-known reaking protocol is Igan layer which has integrated with ethereum and is used for reaking by other protocols including hendle Finance Renzo protocol and swell network scalability is a problem that has challenged the crypto space for a long time especially as more new users explore the world of crypto modularity and data availability are new solutions that Protocols are using to improve scalability Celestia's mayet launch in October last year marked the arrival of the first live modular data availability Network as the first of its kind it focuses on providing data availability services for rollups to verify transactions at lower costs this year we'll likely see the birth of more networks focusing on modularity and data availability to combat scalability problems other similar projects worth watching might be Dimension or a veil project which will be launching their May Nets soon will 2024 be the year of Solana well it could be because the Solana ecosystem has a few things lined up for the year which you can look forward to token extensions will bring new features to make building an open and customizable token program easier several validator clients are being built as alternatives to the original Solana Labs client making the Solana Network more resilient stable and secure fire dancer is one of these clients and is expected to launch sometime in the first half of the year thanks to the launch of game shift a new gaming API that integrates blockchain features into games we might also be looking at a surge in web two friendly games on Solana the Resurgence of the Solana ecosystem at the end of last year is expected to continue this year with more projects choosing to launch on Solana in 2021 there were a lot of game five projects that promised AAA quality blockchain games but until now some of them haven't exactly delivered but after 2 years of development could 2024 be the year that these games come to see the light light of day some of these games include star Atlas alivium Metal core and shrapnel next up there may be a ripple effect across the Bitcoin ecosystem thanks to some interesting events Bitcoin having is projected to happen in April and will bring more attention to the ecosystem it is likely that ordinals the Bitcoin nfts will receive their fair share of the spotlight Stacks protocol is also anticipating its Nakamoto release before the Bitcoin having which will bring the Bitcoin Network faster transactions and pave the way for sbtc to round up our list is the combination of dpin and AI an interesting narrative that's worth exploring this year dpin stands for decentralized physical infrastructure networks and is essentially networks that use crypto incentives to coordinate the development of physical infrastructure like telecommunications systems the systems use digital tokens to incentivize the supply side to build and expand the Network's capabilities dpin isn't A New Concept but it's been gaining more traction recently among the deepin projects gaining traction are helium Network Hive mapper and file coin deepend projects have also started integrating AI to promote decentralization and improve efficiency with AI these projects have access to a suite of tools like Advanced threat detection and crowd Source data collection the integration of AI and dpin can benefit both Technologies and lead to a more efficient secure and decentralized physical infrastructure some of the upcoming projects that are combining deepin and AI are AI Oz Network fetch.ai Kudos flux and render Network Foundation and there you have it eight crypto narratives to keep your eye on in 2024 but don't forget to always do your own

the $3,000 Mark a level it hasn't seen since tera's collapse in April 2022 this may be in part due to excitement following Franklin Templeton spot eth ETF filing on the 12th of February Standard Chartered has also put out a bullish price prediction on eth speculating that it could double in price following an eth ETF approval in May others however are not so optimistic that an approval will come at all this year aside from that the denune upgrade has successfully Gone live on the sapoia and heski test Nets leaving only the main net launch which is currently scheduled for the 13th of March the much anticipated denune upgrade will bring about Proto dank sharding which is expected to significantly lower the cost of layer 2os we also see that eth BTC has seen another bounce so it's probably worth keeping an eye on this chart outside Bitcoin and ethereum projects continue launching a number of them coming with airdrops for their Community among the popular projects which launched with airdrops include two modular blockchains Dimension and ALT layer both projects aiming to ease the deployment of app chains or roll apps daps also continue to take on the points Playbook with many launching campaigns for users to interact and earn points on their platform to be converted into an airdrop in the future drift protocol on Solana is among the latest to implement this and plans to launch its token shortly after its points campaign wraps up in March you could say that the point system has evolved into a market of its own with some projects like kelp issuing tokens for igen layer points and protocols like whales Market making points available for peer-to-peer trading meanwhile users who have traded nfts on Magic mag Eden in 2021 are eligible to claim diamonds which will convert to rewards in the future Saga and upcoming gaming focused L1 also announced recently that it would offer playto airdrop rewards to players of games on other chains like Solana Avalanche and polygon in the leadup to its Saga token launch which is planned for quarter 2 this year many web 3 gaming projects have launched in the past couple of weeks the most notable ones were mavia a mobile online multiplayer base Builder strategy game and pixel a farming game on Ronin both projects rewarded their players with airdrops in the form of mavia and pixel tokens Stark net has also finally aird dropped its governance and gas token Stark to the community however many people were disgruntled about the eligibility criteria which seemed to favor developers over regular users optimism also announced their fourth airdrop worth about $41 million to almost 23,000 addresses check to see if you're eligible via their official channels in the last couple of weeks AI related project tokens such as worldcoin render fetch.ai and more have also seen a runup following open ai's announcement of Sora its latest text to video model this was probably further bolstered by nidia's latest earnings report which beat expectations well that's all for this update check out our other videos for more and remember to like And subscribe to our Channel",Youtube video,"Crypto’s LATEST: Bitcoin SURGE,

0ZZLs8hSu4g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZZLs8hSu4g,"if you've been keeping tabs with the crypto space for the past year you'd notice that projects have been picking up the pace when it comes to airdrops after a relatively quiet time after the arbitrum airdrop last March Aptos blur Celestia Mand jitto py Manta Jupiter Dimension and ALT layer are among the higher profile projects to airdrop tokens to their community in just the last few months fret not as it's looking like there is more to come in 2025 for starting with number 10 on the list is ambient an amm Dex on ethereum scroll and Kanto that hosts all its markets on a single smart contract resulting in lower gas fees on transactions as ambient tweeted back in December 2023 if ambient were to perform an airdrop the likely criteria would be for users to become liquidity providers for liquidity pools on ambient besides that users can also perform swaps set limit orders as well as getting a chance to qualify for a potential scroll air drop by performing tasks while on ambient through the scroll Network which brings us to our next potential airdrop scroll scroll is a layer two built to scale ethereum by using ZK rollup technology it also implements layer 2 mining that separates transaction batching and Mining to protect users against negative Mev while the team has not confirmed the release of a token it's likely the team will eventually release a token for protocol governance as seen with other layer 2os such as optimism and arbitrum to be eligible for this potential airdrop users will likely need to First Bridge tokens to scroll using the official Bridge after that explore scroll's ecosystem by interacting with daps on scroll one of which is ambient as mentioned earlier moving on to number eight it's ZK sync another ZK roll up with a highly anticipated airdrop zync has long confirmed the launch of a token in their documentation so an airdrop is likely a matter of when and not if like other layer 1 or layer 2 air drop strategies eligible recipients will likely need to bridge to ZK sync and interact with the various daps on the chain on to number seven on the list it's igen layer a protocol which enables users to restake their eth to secure other applications and earn additional rewards although there's no official word on an Igan layer token yet Igan layer is running a restak points Campaign which suggests a future token for early and active users to qualify for a potential igen layer airdrop users can interact with igen layer by staking re eth or sth on Igan layer's test net or on the main net when there is an opportunity to do so since reaking directly with igen layer is often unavailable due to their deposit caps this brings us to the next airdrop on the list to watch for Renzo protocol a liquid reaking Hub built on Igan layer Renzo enables users to restake eth without worrying about Igan layer's liquid reaking caps while handling reaking strategies for its users while there is no word on an airdrop Renzo has similarly implemented a point system where users can earn easy points as well as igen layers restak points by reaking their eth to Mint easy eth besides that users that hold easy eth in their wallets will receive one easy point every hour as well as earning additional points for referring other users to participate in Renzo similarly kelp Dow is also a reaking platform built on igen layer which enables users to restake their eth without having to wait for igen layer to raise deposit caps while earning Igan layer restak points it is also running its own campaign which allows users who interact with the DAP to collect kelp miles which is likely to be an eligibility criteria for any future airdrop up next we have layer zero an omni chain messaging protocol which enables interoperability between different blockchains we' previously made a video on layer zero and it's long awaited potential airdrop so we'll be brief about it here layer Zero's team recently confirmed that they will release a token sometime in the first half of 2024 though has not mentioned the specific criteria to qualify for an airdrop or that the snapshot date has already passed so you can still try your hand at qualifying for it by interacting with projects on layer zero next on our list is Rabbi a multi-chain wallet by dbank that supports 129 networks aside from its vast support of different blockchains rabby claims to deliver a smooth multi-chain experience by Auto switching between different networks as well as a suite of security features for users that interact with smart contracts although a rabby airdrop is only a speculation at this point rabie recently launched Rabbi points to Spur users to switch over to Rabbi initial Rabbi points are given to every evm wallet based on the Wallet balance at a snapshot date users can earn extra points by using the wallet's swap feature gas top up feature and referring others to use Robie wallet it also seems like Robie is taking on metamask head-on as up to 12,000 Robie points are up for grabs to users that have used metamask swap in the last year to claim these points they simply have to import their metamask wallet into rabby while it isn't clear what users can do with their Robie points Robbie stated that there are plans to further build on the program and that a rewarding future awaits its users it's also worth mentioning that metamask has has confirmed their intentions in launching a token as the competition in the wallet space develops it seems metamask is increasingly pressured to perform an airdrop to prepare for this we have made a video covering everything you need to know about a potential metamask airdrop furthermore there are also rumors about the company behind Rabbi debank to perform an airdrop for users using its D5 portfolio tracker and web 3 social feed check out our video to find out more about a potential dbank airdrop finally for a couple of airdrop opportunities in the Solana ecosystem we have margin fi a decentralized lending protocol on Solana margin fi enables users to lend their crypto to earn yield or take out over collateralized loans the DAP also offers a token bridge and swap although margin fi has not confirmed an airdrop the protocol launched mrgn points to reward its users for Interactive AC ING with its dap both lenders and borrowers can earn daily points for the length of their deposits and Loans there's also a referral program where users can earn 10% of the points earned by the referee similarly another dii protocol on Solana started implementing a point system for rewarding its users Camino which you can also experiment with and perhaps become eligible for an airdrop it's also worth mentioning a number of other projects mentioned in our previous video which haven't completed their potential airdrop yet such as shardan Qui Network and more as a bonus another opportunity that you could be looking out for is on the cosmos ecosystem Cosmos is a blockchain network architecture that hosts a network of numerous independent blockchains some notable blockchains built on Cosmos include injective osmoses and Celestia Cosmos has long been known for the numerous airdrops it rewards stakers of its native token atom or other ecosystem tokens though due to the attention from higher profile Cosmos based projects such as sa Celestia injective and more this may warrant it more attention in 2024 to provide an airdrop guide for the cosmos ecosystem would require a whole other video on its own though so subscribe to our Channel if you don't want to miss out also remember to catch our other airdrop videos where we give more detailed guides on how you could potentially be eligible for [Music] them",Youtube video,Top 10 Crypto AIRDROPS You Must Not Miss in 2024!!

yUV3NvfyEMI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUV3NvfyEMI,liquid staking derivatives or liquid staking tokens have been the biggest talk of crypto town in 2023 today liquid staking is by far the largest dii category with over 27 billion of TV the premise is simple you stake e with one of the LSD protocols like Lio or rocket pool and in return you get a liquid receipt token that earns you yield over time but now that you've got these lsds acre yield on your behalf what do you do with them well introducing LSD fi so you've probably guessed by now that LSD f is a combination of LSD and fi for finance more specifically it's a branch of defi that focuses on the utilization of lsds pre yield strategies to help users maximize Returns the wide adoption of lsds saw a rush of protocols building on top of this new primitive first you had eth holders and stakers who wanted to put their asset assets to work and liquid staking was born now that you have all these liquid assets ACR staking yield what good is having all this liquidity if it's not going to be put to use and so LSD fi emerged you can classify LSD F protocols into five broad categories lending is one of the core pillars of finance and that includes both traditional and decentralized finance with the emergence of lsds a new dimension has opened up for Lending compared to naked eth yield bearing lsds are much more attractive collateral since they get to earn staking rewards on top of the deposit interest similarly they also make good loan assets since the staking yield is able to offset the borrow cost partially and in certain cases entirely lending giants like a compound and Banky have all embraced lsds as collaterals whereas newer entrance like Silo and radiant have also carved a name for themselves within the LSD f space collateralized debt positions or CDP stable coins are created by depositing and locking collateral in a smart contract which in this case are lsds and getting newly minted stable coins in return the concept was pioneered by maker Dow with its die stable coin which used eth as collateral now that support has been extended to lsds too and already we have protocols like Libra Prisma finance and gravita in the frontier for LSD backed stable coins Libra has further added a new twist to the idea by redistributing staking rewards from the LSD deposits to the holders of its stable coin e USD making it an interest bearing stable coin this means that by simply holding e USD holders can earn a yield derived from E staking over the past year LSD back stable coins have grown tremendously in adoption but still lack behind competitors such as usdt and die for context the largest LSD back stable coin from Prisma MK USD only ranks number 15 out of all the stable coins in market cap still a far cry away from the top Market leaders usdt and usdc it's clear that these new contenders will still need to withstand the test of time that it's competitors have undergone before it can win the trust of users this segment of lsdy addresses an important question that weighs on the mind of every single def user how can I earn more you want more money in principle all of these earning platforms operate similarly providing tempting apis but they employ various mechanisms to achieve the same goal Pendle for instance lets users split the yield and principle from lsds to trade them separately similar to how interest rate swaps work in traditional Finance suo offers automated vaults that are designed to boost rewards for lsds inap on the other hand helps users maximize yield by leveraging SD in various protocols like a compound and Moro there are many other platforms that can help you get the most bang out of your LSD Buck such as asymmetrics CN tkem and more it all comes down to a matter of each individual's risk tolerance needs and preferences okay so then an index LSD offers exposure to a basket of lsds providing an easy way for users to have a diversified yield and risk exposure depending on the protocol this basket composition can be vastly different origin ether or OE for instance and employs liquidity provision strategies on top of LSD such as SD and re e to deliver a higher yield instead of just holding St or re e you can hold o e instead which will passively generate yield for you from various sources there are many other index protocols like Stak Stone y e by urine and index coupe with their own unique blend of LSD baskets just like traditional ETFs or index funds these indices offer investors a convenient solution to access a diverse range of lsds through a single asset okay then last but not least we have reaking a reimagination of how eth or lsds can be utilized on the Forefront of this is igen layer which through the use of smart contracts is able to allow stakers to repurpose their LSD assets to also secure other networks or protocols essentially earning additional more yield on top of ethereum staking rewards many have touted reaking as the next big thing in defi with the transformative potential to disrupt the entire space following in the footsteps of igen layer several other protocols have also ventured into reaking there's tenet a L1 which utilizes lsds as collateral to secure its own network as well as reaking pools such as asterid finance and puffer Finance like its brother LSD lsdy has been one of the fastest growing sectors this year but despite this the latest data estimates that the LSD F market accounts for only 1.1% of defi this is particularly surprising considering that LSD is the largest segment in defi amounting close to $30 billion in liquidity if anything this only shows the large addressable Market that lies in weight for this corner of defi now it's also worth mentioning that while we've only talked about ethereum lsdy in this video the sector is also emerging for other chains such as Solana and while the earning opportunities presented by LSD can be tempting it's important to also bear in mind that depositing your assets into these platforms means you're exposing yourself to another layer of risk so remember to take care and a responsibly geckos if you want to

E-57_i1HG70,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-57_i1HG70,ever wondered what it would be like to split yourself up into multiple 's working 5 10 20 jobs all at once and earning just as many paychecks well the bad news we're not quite there yet for humans but the good news you can already do this with eth thanks to a little defi magic called reaking so we're already familiar with how liquid staking tokens or lsts work you can think of staking as the next evolutionary step from this the idea of raking is simple we've already got all these staked eth securing the ethereum blockchain so why not repurpose what we already have across multiple venues to secure multiple protocols and earn multiple yields all at the same time with reaking e staking can be outs source to secure other new protocols or ecosystems and users will be able to tap into these platforms to earn additional fees and rewards on top of what they are already getting from staking e so reaking has the potential to reshape the defi landscape as a new emerging primitive overhauling how cryptoeconomic security should be approached and offering greater accessibility trust assurances and income opportun unities at the Forefront of this is none other than the Pioneers themselves Igan lay Igan layer was founded by streim Cannon who was previously a tenur associate professor at University of Washington where he directed the UW blockchain lab focusing on designing new blockchain infrastructure protocols in fact all of Igan layer's first team members came from the same lab Ian layer essentially provides the infrastructure and blueprint that enables reaking without getting too deep into the weeds users who have staked their eth natively or in liquid staking protocols can participate in Igan layer smart contracts to restake and secure other platforms creating a sort of pooled security which leverages ethereum the largest POS Network by value of staked tokens usually creators of new protocols need to bootstrap a new trust Network to get security including spinning up a whole new blockchain network with its validators native tokens building Network effects and so forth with reaking new protocols or actively validated Services can tap into the pulled security of ethereum stakers instead making this process a lot more Capital efficient AVS are also called igen layer modules and can be anything from a side chain a bridge or Oracle Network keeper network data availability layer and more in the traditional Silo model attackers could succeed by simply compromising one of the AVS with Igan layer's pulled security everything will be anchored in ethereum and attackers will need to attack the entire pulled stake instead which is worth $13 billion at the time of shooting now bear in mind however that opting into Igan lay smart contracts also means that you may be subjecting your staked EAS to additional slashing conditions for stakers this pool security means they'll be able to earn more by securing all these other AVS by simply reaking eth instead of using separate tokens in order to facilitate this service Ian layer has introduced an Open Marketplace a place where aspiring ABS will be able to woo the favor of e validators in this system validators will have the power to pick and choose which igen layer module to support this would of course mean that modules must offer appealing incentives to these wouldbe validators with the combination of pooled security and an Open Marketplace for it Ian layer effectively functions as an intermediary layer between ethereum and other blockchain applications as of January 2024 igen layer is in its second test net phase although the igen layer team has given no indications of a token release at the time of writing several users have rushed to interact with this guarded launch with hopes of qualifying for an airdrop during this test net period liquid reaking with rocket pool re e Lido St and coinbase CB e will be limited in the testnet period while native eth reaking will be uncapped with a tbll of 1.11 billion igen layer is already a top 50 D5 protocol logically the concept of reaking should appeal to users due to the seamless integration of multiple yield streams for lsts while this may be true it is also worth noting that vitalic bin has openly expressed concerns over reaking exposing ethereum validators to more work and duties complicates their primary role of securing the ethereum network and may introduce risks that could potentially jeopardize the security of the main net especially when these validators face slashing in third-party protocols Canon the founder of enan lay also echoed the same sentiment and agreed with vitalic but reiterated that reaking can still be used for lowrisk scenarios such as highly attributable misbehaviors such as double signing or forgetting the decentralization benefits of ethereum without without slashing meanwhile many other protocols have also started venturing into reaking there's puffer finance a liquid raking pool that allows users to restake their eth or lsts these puffers stake eth for puff eth a liquid raking token or LRT that will let its holders earn both staking and raking rewards in a sense puffer Finance is acting as a broker to restake all the e deposits into igen layer on behalf of its users other projects include tenants a ler one blockchain which utilizes lsts as collateral to secure its own network and ASD Finance another reaking Pool similar to puffer finance reaking and igen layer seem primed to emerge as the next defi primitive offering numerous benefits to developers and Market participants alike just like LST and LST 5 it won't be long before other protocols start tapping into the L Market thanks to reaking e staking is now a more attractive yield Avenue which could encourage more users in liquidity to hop on board ethereum St ratio is still one of the lowest across other POS chains like Solana Cosmos and polygon but the combined M of LST lstf and reaking could very well be the force needed to this number up so that's it for reaking if you want to learn more about e staking and LST 5 well then check out our

OP0UIzdVIR8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP0UIzdVIR8,"we've completed another revolution around the Sun so what has crypto done in that span of time we'll find out in this video as we cover the most important insights from our 2023 annual crypto industry report as usual we start with our review of the overall crypto Market which has climbed 108% in 2023 or 869 billion in absolute terms most of these gains 607 billion came just in Q4 average trading volume in Q4 was almost double that of Q3 however is still 32% down compared to 2022 average over 2023 Bitcoin dominance has soared to 47.8% up from 38.6% this has eaten away at the market share of all other top seven cryptos except for Solana which also saw a significant growth in market share from 0.4% to 2.5% flipping xrp and usdc at number five and number six respectively at one point Solana even flipped BNB briefly to take the number four place of cryptos by market cap stable coins which saw a decrease in dominance also indicates an inflow of fiat currency into the market most of this going into Bitcoin interestingly others saw a slight increase despite Bitcoin dominance increasing and this may be explained by the various new tokens like Tia say ARB and more which popped into existence sometime in the year and are already in the top 50 by market cap taking a look at stable coins the top 15 stable coins saw a 6% decline in market cap compared to the end of last year the predominant narrative here is certainly that usct has solidified its position as the number one stable coin with its market share climbing from 49 % to 71% over the course of 2023 usct benefited from the decline of usdc which lost 45% or 20 billion of its market cap as holders lost some confidence after its brief deeg incident during the US banking crisis in March BD has also fallen out of the picture as its phase out is almost complete on slide nine we have a new inclusion into our report which is the top trending coin gecko category as measured by web traffic to our coin category Pages the top 15 categories commanded 72% of our web traffic with the top three in 2023 being Ai gamei and meme coins Solana ecosystem came in fourth place while BRC 20s rwa and dpin or decentralized physical infrastructure networks which were new categories in 2023 also made it into the top 15 the next slide notes down some of the highlights and low lights of 2023 bankruptcies and a slew of legal action against crypto businesses were among the low lights of the year however we also saw important developments such as the launch of ordinals on bitcoin the ethereum chapella upgrade Black Rock and others applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs regulatory wins secured by grayscale and ripple and mount goau initiating repayment to its creditors 2023 was also a year filled with new project launches with countless l2s l1s like seu Aptos and modular chains like Celestia entering the scene this video is brought to you by Bing x a leading crypto exchange with over 10 million users worldwide Bing X offers spot derivatives copy trading and asset management in 2024 Bing X proudly became Chelsea FC's principal partner then we also have a dedicated slide for notable bugs and exploits where at least least 2 billion was lost to 463 exploits in 2023 66% of these losses came from just the top six hacks multi-chain which lost 231 million uler Finance which lost 196 million pully next 123 million Bon Dow at 120 million and atomic wallet with 115 million lost one pretty scary exploit was The Ledger connect kit exploit and the December which injected malicious code into daps that were using the open-source software which connected daps to wallets fortunately the exploit was quickly spotted and patched and the losses only totaled about 600,000 Low by crypto exploit standards as for the number one crypto Bitcoin saw an almost up only year in 2023 with a 155% increase as a rally at the start of the year was dowed with more more fuel with the shock announcement of spot Bitcoin ETF filings from the largest asset manager Black Rock with other big names following suit bullishness could also be due to the expectations of interest rate cuts by the FED in 2024 since the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10th Bitcoin made another leg up to top 48.5k before retracing to about 42k at the time of shooting as for Bitcoin mining this chart will be looking pretty similar for anyone that has been watching it since Q2 of 2022 this is because hash rate has continued to see continuous quarter on quarter growth since then with a 105% or over two times increase in 2023 miners continue to expand in anticipation of the next Bitcoin having in April with new site and Asic purchases by big names like Marathon digital bit origin Riot Cipher And Hive public listed Bitcoin mining company stocks have also been on a tear with Cipher Marathon clean spark and Riot recording gains of 65 556 425 and 343 respectively outperforming Bitcoin compared to other major asset classes though Bitcoin was still by far the outperformer of the year though the NASDAQ and S&P 500 also posted strong returns with a 42% and 24% gain respectively gold also climbed by 13% while The Biggest Loser of 2023 would be crude oil which saw its first annual decline since 2020 this could be sparked by fears of oversupply from production outside the OPEC countries though recent escalating tensions in the Middle East could serve as a supply disruptor the global economy could enter a recession inscriptions also deserve a highlight in in 2023 as it has brought the frenzy of nfts and meme coins to bitcoin nfts are making a corporate comeback and the trading of inscriptions has led to a boom for miners as transaction fees Skyrocket December 17 saw the highest ever daily total transaction fees paid to bitcoin miners at 23.7 million and total inscriptions on the Bitcoin Network reached 52.8 million at the end of 2023 as for ethereum it saw a 91% return in 2023 though compared to bitcoin and even many other altcoins it has been lagging behind it rallied alongside Bitcoin at the start of the year however saw a long consolidation from Q2 to Q3 before rallying again in Q4 alongside the rest of the market however now with the spot Bitcoin ETFs approved eyes may now turn to the next expected in line in case anyone has forgotten Black Rock has also filed for a spot e ETF back in November delays its decision on Black Rock Spot ethereum ETF the network also saw the dkan upgrade that would see EIP 4844 or Proto Den sharding scheduled for the first half of this year this is expected to reduce gas fees and Boost network efficiency aside from that it's worth noting that eth also posted its first deflationary year with a net burn of 1.09 million e in 2023 layer 2 adoption has also continue to climb with over 1.3 billion cumulative transactions in 2023 with arbitrum taking the lead processing almost the same amount of transactions as the ethereum main net Solana's Rise From the Ashes also cannot be ignored with the soul token climbing over 10 times in 2023 and trading volume surging along with it in Q4 the Resurgence of interest can be attributed to a number of bullish narratives going for it such as its resilience post FTX oppos or only possible on Solana referring to its unique abilities as a performant monolithic layer one and a proliferation of popular meme coins like Bonk whiff and also an uptick of airdrops by projects in its ecosystem like jup pyth and more incoming its blazing speed cheap fees and friendly daps also make for a great ux which promotes on boarding of new users defi also saw a Resurgence climbing by about 129% which meant it outperformed the overall crypto Market which only climbed 108% appetite for leverage has also spurred an increase in yields for stable coins which have now surpassed the trafi risk-free rate of short-term USD bills which sits slightly under 5% currently overall tvl and defi has grown by 56% % with ethereum remaining uncontested yet again Solana has unsurprisingly seen a major Revival in 2023 growing its tvl by 441 or 447 million though largely going under the radar Tron is now the second largest chain by tvl outpacing B&B chain taking a look at the different D5 sectors liquid staking had risen to the top in Q4 2023 while tvl on yield Farms had risen by a whopping 74 times despite them taking up only about 1% of overall tvl market share nft trading volume across the top 10 chains saw an 80% increase however remains less than half of what it was in 2022 while ethereum continues to be the main nft chain in 2023 capturing 72% of overall trading volume it has lost significant market share to bitcoin and Solana particularly in December I wouldn't believe it if someone told me this one year ago but Bitcoin actually emerged as the top nft Network in December fueled by the ordinals and brc2 craze as for crypto exchanges the tldr of it is that there was recovery across the board in 2023 with spot and Perpetual trading volumes and open interest seeing a significant increase in both decentralized and centralized exchanges this indicates revived interests and appetite for speculation in the crypto markets that was a lot to cover but that's crypto in 2023 for you you can find the link to read the

dMeJcKFRvLY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMeJcKFRvLY,"2024 is set to be a huge year for crypto with many heralding the return of a bull market sometime soon we'll take a Peak at 8 reasons why you should pay attention to crypto in 2024 from groundbreaking news to regulatory shifts we've got the inside scoop on why the crypto Market might be gearing up for a meteoric rise so let's get right into it in the number one spot we have the biggest talk of crypto Town Bitcoin has seen a 155% rally last year driven by expectations leading up to the historic moment on January 10th when all 11 spot Bitcoin ETF applications were approved by the SEC it finally happened how many years 11 years we've been waiting for this by the next morning 10 spot Bitcoin ETF products made their debut in the US markets and cumulative trading volume topped 4.5 billion in their first day the grayscale Bitcoin trust let the pack with 2.3 billion in volume after its conversion into an ETF followed by black Rock's ey shares Bitcoin trust which saw 1 billion in trade volume and Fidelity's wise origin Bitcoin fund with 700 million in volume in case you needed a refresher on how this is a pivotal development Bitcoin ETFs will greatly lower the barrier of Entry to bitcoin ownership opening the floodgates for both institutional and Retail money to flow in these asset managers have trillions of dollars worth of assets under management and if even a small portion of this flows into crypto the effect could be very significant of course this Capital won't be invested overnight but having the ETF as a Gateway certainly paints a Rosier future arguably one of the most important bullish catalysts is the expected start of rate cuts by the fed the Federal Reserve kept the FED funds rate steady at 5.25 to 5.5% for a third consecutive meeting in December 2023 in line with expectations but also indicated 75 BPS Cuts in 2024 so why is this good news for us when interest rates fall there is more liquidity in the market as fixed income instruments become less attractive leading to more flow of capital towards risk on asset classes such as stocks and crypto this is the basic gist of it but of course more factors are at play here the economy could strengthen or weaken geopolitical Strife could worsen all of which could affect the broader market and yes that includes crypto too then one of the most pivotal events in crypto history is repeating this year every four years or so the rewards for Bitcoin mining is cut in half and the next having is expected to occur in April 202 4 which is when the reward will fall to 3.125 bitcoin per block now historically this has always indicated the start of a bull run with many citing The increased scarcity of Bitcoin as the Catalyst behind the price hike want to keep your eye on the price well then keep track or learn more about Bitcoin having from coin gecko's dedicated page sometime in May last year Hong Kong Securities and Futures commission confirmed that retail invest vors could begin trading major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and ethereum in June 2023 under its new regulatory framework the move is part of Hong Kong's efforts to establish itself as a digital asset help while ensuring investor protection but also another indication that China and Hong Kong have turned around on their approach towards crypto all crypto transactions are illegal and how we can expect even more adoption soon 2023 was a huge year for defi with liquid stake tokens and real world assets leading the charge in revitalizing this sector along with a slew of other developments in l2s Dap chains and modularity novel Dex mechanisms and more as these continue to grow alongside new Innovations such as reaking and fixed yield derivatives def's yield opportunities are set to lure capital inflow and will be a pivotal game way for big institutional players to come on chain after a dry spell money is finally making its way back into crypto glass noes data reveals the 90day change in stable coin supplies amongst the top four usdt usdc bosd and D flipped positive for the first time since teras collaps in May 2022 historically stable coins have fueled crypto purchases and this uptick suggests a potential surge in buying power and also a recovery of a lost faith in crypto when in doubt follow the whales it would seem that the new influx of stables have indeed been put to good use long-term holders remain bullish on the prospects of a Bitcoin Bull Run and continue to accumulate Bitcoin Wheels with 1,000 Bitcoin or more have also been showing signs of accumulation which is normally preceded large rallies one of these is of course famous Bitcoin Maxi Michael sailor's business intelligence firm micro

dipping their toes or continuing to increase their efforts even in the midst of the bare Market this video will cover some of the most notable Ventures into web 3 in the past year or [Music] so when Lambo in late February 2023 we had none other than Lamborghini launching their latest n collection in collaboration with the VV nft Marketplace the latest drop includes the hurricane stto with different Rarity traits the lambo Collectibles can then be displayed in the VV app's virtual showrooms and shared on its social feeds and even be viewed and driven on real world streets via augmented reality features this isn't Lamborghini's first foray into web 3 having released earlier collections in January 2022 SpaceTime memory which comprises of a series of five exclusive photographs and from mid 2022 onwards there's the Epic Road collection which grants holders special privileges or merchandise aside from Lamborghini McLaren and Alfa Romeo tested nfts last year while Porsche also released their nft collection in January 2023 though that was met with a fair bit of criticism from the crypto Community next we have payments giant v integrating with popular layer one Solana to settle usdc transactions Visa had already begun testing use of usdc way back in 2021 and publicly signaled its belief in the web 3 Space by purchasing Punk number 7610 in August 2021 later on Visa launched an nft Creator program to support onboarding small businesses into the digital economy viewing nfts as a new form of E Commerce Visa is not the only player in the digital payment space to dabble in web 3 with MasterCard recently following suit with their own web 3 music accelerator program which provides budding artists with support like AI Tech and Educational Tools are any of you fans of Rick and

T6elMvzuWsg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6elMvzuWsg,"2023 was a great year for crypto considering the market has been in slump throughout 2022 having endured high-profile collapses like Tera and FTX since 2023 began Bitcoin seems to be the tide that has lifted many Al boats as it had managed to make a gradual recovery early in the year rising to 30k before picking things back up in full swing in Q4 making a yearly high of 44.2k in December as the year closed out with a bang let's look at the top 10 gainers we had in 2023 to be sure that our list doesn't contain every single meme coin that flew off the rails recently we chose to only include coins in crypto's top 50 buy market cap let's begin by starting at number 10 on the list near protocol a layer one blockchain prioritizing on speed and cheap transactions defined by its use of shards near has practically exploded in the last quarter and put in a high of 4.30 in December producing a yearly return of 190% likely driven by the release of nearest data availability layer which they claim to be 11,000 times cheaper than ethereum and 30 times cheaper than Celestia it might also have helped that near launch the blockchain operating system in early 2023 BOS is a developmental stack for web 3 developers to create and distribute daps next up is internet computer which pretty much was stagnant for most of 2023 then started climbing in November and eventually took off in the middle of December and put in a yearly High during New Year's Eve at 12.40 a 215% increase since the year began since internet computers may not launch launch back in late 2020 it has seen some major developmental goals reached in 2023 internet computer aims to offer a decentralized internet for developers to build and host applications from ICP is the token used to pay for transactions storage computation and other services on the network number eight is the graph a data indexing protocol that organizes data from various blockchains to enable developers to query and access blockchain data in other words a Google for blockchains what Google does for the web the graph does for blockchains the graph's utility token GRT was seen to have spiked to 0.21 in February before grinding back down for the most part of 2023 as October came around GRT rallied back up to about the same level eventually reaching a high of 0.20 before the year closed out at seventh place is another layer one blockchain Avalanche as layer one blockchains made a comeback in Q4 2023 the community seemed to have turned to Avalanche as they looked for the next winner in this domain perhaps thanks to the vestages of the so laon avax meme from the last bull cycle Avalanche put in an impressive rally since October topping out at 4336 producing a 262 % increase since the year started other than increased attention on layer one blockchains among other Tailwinds include the Avalanche foundations's 50 million investment in real world assets tokenization and major banks tokenizing rwa on Avalanches subnets number six on the list is optimism while ethereum has been taking a backseat during the recent market-wide rally its layer 2 rollup optimism is no slouch like propelled by The increased adoption of optimism super chain initiative and its open- source layer 2 developmental op stack optimism had rallied since October and managed to put in a new all-time high of 3.96 before the year closed out which marks a 294% gain in fifth place is immutable X another ethereum layer 2 rollup but with a focus on web 3 gaming immutable X seem to have captured some of the growth that came with web 3 gaming as the sector saw some Resurgence and interest earlier in 2023 immutable X climbed to a high of 1.55 before cooling back down as November came around immutable picked it back up and put in a new yearly high of 2.49 right before the year closed a 48% increase since the year started up next in fourth place is stocks a smart contract blockchain built on the Bitcoin Network by using it as its data settlement layer as the year began Stacks was at 0.23 before rallying to 1.18 in March around the same time Bitcoins ordinals protocol launched and gained momentum since then stocks has mostly sold off and declined until October came about by then the crypto Market as a whole picked up steam again and ordinals was once once again among the Hot Topics in the space if you've not looked into ordinal it's like something you should should look into likely fueled by the continued ordinal frenzy stocks made a new yearly high of 1.63 in December putting in an impressive 57% climb for 2023 moving on to the heavy weights taking the top three Gainer spots our next winner will in no doubt be one that is already living rentree and most viewers Minds snagging third place on the list is none other than the leader in the alt layer one space Solana despite receiving a massive 95% Beatdown after the collapse of FTX in 2022 Solana has pulled off a dramatic recovery early in the year where its price more than doubled to about $24 in the first quarter from 9.96 even with major Partnerships with big boys like Google visa and circle alongside a slew of technical upgrades this is all perhaps overshadowed by the unrelenting meme Fest that has been happening on Solana since October Solana has torn up the price chart putting consecutive new yearly highs until it topped out at 12145 on December 28th resulting in a spectacular 923 yearly increase however this is far followed by a precipitous drop to 101.33 by New Year's Eve the runnerup on this list is yet another layer one blockchain Caspa built based on the ghost dag protocol which could be thought of as a more scalable version of the Bitcoin consensus Casa aims to deliver High block rates while retaining the security and decentralization offered by proof of work consensus Caspa started the year at 0.008 and embarked on a rally that began around March but eventually sent it to an all-time high of 0.039 in April before cooling off as the community gets excited with the launch of testnet 11 which features an upgrade that increases kaspa's block rate to 10 blocks per second the project went on another rally that brought its price to roughly 0.05 in September before consolidating for 2 months then in November Caspa went on a rampage resulting in a new all-time high of 0.15 and a whopping 280% yearly increase before a correction ensued let's give it up for 2023 is best performing Gainer injective injective is a def5 focus layer one that is tackling the me issues prevalent in evm environments while featuring Auto executing smart contracts injective was SE on a steady uptrend up since the year began reaching a high of 9.32 before consolidating for more than half of the year as injective announced in evm an evm compatible layer 2 developed in collaboration with Caldera and the volan upgrade the project took off since October and eventually printed a new all-time high of 4352 on December 26 2023 beating every project in in the top 50 crypto by market cop with an incredible 2,851 rally what a year 2023 was for crypto well that's all for the top 2023

which can cost you therefore when the market is showing you signs of strength it's wise to be on your toes and be ready to adopt a different mindset having the appropriate outlook on the market will help you make the right decisions with your funds after all if you're still here I'm still here hasn't the reason for following a 2year bare Market been to ensure that you are well positioned for the next Bull Run simply being bullish in a bull market is probably not enough however and you'll need a plan to navigate the market this tip is important enough to be worth repeating it doesn't really matter if you are day trading swing trading buy holding or dcing a wellth thought out plan should detail your investment or trading strategy and ensure that you have a good reason for every action you take in the market and then developing the discipline to stick to your plan is just as crucial as making one don't just abandon your playbook whenever a meme coin pumps 20% in a day now while crypto Twitter and like-minded friends can be valuable for identifying opportunities it's important to maintain a healthy level of skepticism and always Dy R you should also be careful to not let social media and peers influence your decision making in the market which brings back the point of sticking to your plan in fact having a plan is so important that it's worth zooming in on two specific specific aspects risk management and profit taking while there's no guarantee that your plan will make you the gains that you expect managing your risk or losses is one thing that you must nail down if you're hoping to have any chance of succeeding in the long run now you might be tempted to beted Big on a shiny new altcoin in expectation of huge amounts of profit but you must also be mindful of the losses that you're able to take this is because like compounding returns losses can compound quickly if you are careless for example if you experience a 10% loss on your portfolio you will need an 11% gain to get back to break even a 25% loss takes a 33% gain to recover if you lose half of your money you will need to make double that just to break even and if you somehow manage to lose 80% of your Capital you will need a whopping five 100% gain just to get back to where you started now that being said I'm not trying to scare you so don't be overly afraid to experience some losses in the markets especially in a bull market but you simply have to identify your risk tolerance as well as how much returns you can expect from your strategy and manage your risk accordingly now some people may prefer a steadily appreciating portfolio While others may prefer a more aggressive approach and can handle more downside and volatility regardless of your strategy having a solid risk management plan ensures that you will always stay in the game regardless of what the market throws at you besides risk management you should also have a plan for taking profits when we're experiencing an uptrending Market it can sometimes feel like the market just keeps going up and up and up only then you wake up one day and all you see on your screen is a of red you get upset as you watch what was big amounts of profit diminish dramatically you might even hold on to your bags hoping for prices to recover but there's no telling if or when that would happen now this could have been easily avoided if you had a plan for taking profits the reason for taking profits is twofold first taking profits permanently locks in your hard-earned gains and secure WI it is the only way to ensure you make money in the markets there's nothing more heartbreaking than seeing what could have been a great win turn into a loss which leads us to the next reason for profit taking by taking profit even partial profits you are less likely to be affected psychologically by market volatility it ensures that you will be less frustrated if the market pulls back with of course the added bonus of having spare cash to buy the dip if you wanted to however there is such a thing as taking profit too early typically out of fear that is why it is important to plan your takeprofit targets early on and stick to them our next tip is to manage your emotions even with a plan you would still feel powerful emotions such as fear greed and impatience and if you're not careful and indulge in these emotions too much much they can Cloud your judgment and lead you to make emotional decisions fear can cause you to be frozen out when it is time to buy during a dip which can then lead to fomo if a large move happens after you've sidelined yourself greed can cause you to have unrealistic expectations about your Investments which in turn makes you risk too much or hold on to trades longer than you plan to and impatience can lead you to jump in and out of Trades and and Investments out of boredom costing you fees and progress if you don't get a handle on your emotions they will put a toll on your well-being which could snowball easily into making significantly worse decisions and financial losses in the long run your discipline and how well you manage your emotions can dictate your level of success great success if you ever struggle to feel grounded do yourself a favor by by logging off and touching some grass okay our last tip is to consider measuring your portfolio in BTC or eth terms rather than just in USD or Fiat terms these are the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap have the largest Network effects and are generally considered the least risky while it may be nice holding various altcoins when their prices Skyrocket it's also important to remember that their potential for higher returns also comes with higher risk therefore when considering an altcoin holding it's important to consider their risk adjusted returns simply put if your much riskier altcoin is underperforming Bitcoin or ethereum over the long term well then why are you even holding that altcoin well hopefully this video has offered you some important insights on not just making the best out of a crypt bull market but costly pitfalls to avoid as well so good luck and if you want more tips on being well prepared for a crypt bll Market well then be sure to check out our previous video right [Music] here,Youtube video,Incoming BULL RUN?? 6 Crypto Tips You Must Know in 2024!,2024-01-15

Dr6Hlh_2Vxs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr6Hlh_2Vxs,in this video we will talk about some of the smart contract wallets that you can check out today you're probably familiar with how cumbersome the web 3 experience is today approving and confirming transactions needing different tokens to pay gas fees on different blockchains long and difficult to read wallet addresses and not to mention possibly losing all your funds if you lose your seat phrase well smart contract wallets promise to make these problems a thing of the past if you need a refresher on account abstraction which enables smart contract wallets check out our explainer on it here before continuing on this one first up we have Argent a smart contract wallet that works with Stark net and ZK sync Argent provides users with readable addresses through Stark net ID as well as a unique third-party recovery Factory through their Guardians program instead of relying on a seed phrase users May assign one or more wallet addresses as their Guardian to help recover their their wallet in the case of losing wallet access if more than one Guardian is assigned to a wallet users will need a majority vote from trusted wallets to approve a recovery another neat feature from Argent is batch transactions which allows users to save gas fees and time in the process for example when providing liquidity on Unis swap pools one would usually have to pay gas fees and wait for three different transactions to be confirmed by batching all three trans actions into one the user will just have to pay gas fees and wait for one single transaction that accomplishes everything next up we have PL of Finance for Mobile Wallet users it currently supports major evm chains such as polygon BSC Avalanche and Phantom to enable wallet recovery without a seed phrase users can create their smart wallet using a third party login such as Google Facebook or Twitter pla's free pla naming Serv service allows users to chat with and receive funds from other planet users using only Plana names removing the need for the long confusing ZX wallet addresses that we're all so familiar with it also features batch transactions flexibility in tokens used for paying gas and ability to pre-approve transactions on selected D apps up next we have amby amby allows users to create smart contract wallets from Anem email address existing web 3 wallets like metamask or even Hardware wallets like treasure and Ledger with the email option users can even recover their access to the wallet without the need of a seed phrase the wallet currently supports over 10 evm networks including ethereum Avalanche polygon arbitrum and optimism and furthermore its gas tank feature enables users the flexibility to pay gas fees in any erc20 token on any Ed blockchain this means that a user can deposit usdc on optimism and use it to pay for gas on ethereum users who want more security for their wallet can also enable two-factor authentication and add a separate Hardware wallet as Aigner key to verify transactions amby is available as a web-based wallet on browsers as well as a mobile app on App Store and Google Play coming up we have avocado by instad apppp avocado is quite different to other smart contract wallets featured on this list as it also features Network and gas abstraction when using a wallet such as metamask users will have to switch between different networks when they're performing actions across different networks with network abstraction avocado users would simply have to connect their pre-existing wallet like metamask to the avocado network via wallet connect and not only will they see their balances across different networks but perform transactions without switching networks besides that avocado also acts as a gas station where users will only need to use usdc as the gas token to transact on every Network supported by avocado avocado is looking to add more features in the future to further improve user experience such as batching smart contract actions social recovery and gasless experience aside from ethereum avocado Cur currently supports a wide range of evm blockchains and ethereum l2s there's also a wallet that is made for organizations safe also known previously as nosis safe safe is a multi- signature wallet that runs on over 12 networks including ethereum polygon arbitrum and optimism it's used by Major players like a polygon stripe and even vitalic butterin organizations can create smart contract wallets owned by multiple owners to ensure there's no single point of failure as every transaction from the multi-sig wallet will require confirmations from the majority of owners safe also has a host of other features for one it provides the option to customize an existing wallet's ownership by adding or removing owners safe also supports batch transactions and allows its owners to set specific spending limits for any individual involved with the wallet and even set a onetime allowance or a spending allowance that will automatically refill after a defined time period finally there is a wallet built for web 3 gaming sequence sequence allows users to sign in using email Google Facebook and more it supports nine evm networks such as ethereum polygon optimism arbitrum and Bas the wallet enables users to pay gas on any supported networks using eth we madic usdc and D besides that sequin has good support for various types of nfts the wallet also displays the artwork and metadata of nfts stored in it which could come in handy for web 3 Gamers game or daa developers can sponsor transactions with sequence so that their users won't need to pay gas therefore if your favorite web 3 game happens to sponsor your transaction via sequence using this wallet might save you a couple of bucks the wallet is available to users through the web wallets and browser extension for Google Chrome they don't have a mobile app but sequin has mentioned that the web wallet works perfectly with mobile web browsers so that'll be it for today's list but there are also so many other projects working on Smart contract wallets that we couldn't cover in this video such as beam and obvious which we'll have to save for another time do you want to learn more about how account abstraction Works be sure to watch our video to understand how this could be the key to

gd8xfxXeVHo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd8xfxXeVHo,today we're going to be breaking down polygon's exciting new road map for polygon 2.0 their so-called endgame which you don't want to miss fair warning it may all be a bit complex at first so make sure you pay close attention if you're new to all this let's start with the basics the original polygon POS blockchain formerly known as madic Network launched in 2017 as an ethereum side chain which serves to increase the scalability of the eth May net similar to ethereum it uses a proof of stay consensus mechanism for processing transactions on chain and currently uses madic as its native token in March this year they also launched another layer 2 Chain polygon ZK evm an ethereum ZK rollup then in June the announcement of polygon 2.0 detailed the next phase in polygon's evolution polygon 2.0 is envisioned to be a vast network of ZK power powered L2 chains with unlimited scalability and seamless interoperability the goal is to create the value layer of the internet where you can safely and seamlessly exchange digital assets just as the internet enabled the exchange of information soon after this announcement the polygon team began a discussion around upgrading the polygon POS chain to a ZK evm validium a validium is simply another type of scaling solution for ethereum now this is different from the polygon ZK evm chain a ZK rollup which will still coexist as a public network in the polygon 2.0 ecosystem now you might be asking what's the difference between a rollup and a validium while ZK powered validium submit validity ZK proofs to the L1 they do not publish transaction data onchain like ZK willips instead this data is made available offchain giving the iium the advantage of being lower cost while offering higher scalability since its throughput is not limited by the amount of transaction data ethereum can store the upgrade of polygon POs to a ZK evm validium is not only to enable it to inherent higher security and scalability but also to fit the OG chain which has gained significant adoption over the last few years into the larger ZK powered polygon ecos system of the future so now here's the polygon POS chain which will be upgraded to a ZK evm validium and the polygon ZK evm chain so that's two chains so where does the network of ZK powered L2 chains come into the picture well that's where the polygon chain development kit or cdk comes into play which was introduced by the polygon team in August this year the polygon cdk is an open source modular code Bay that anyone can use to launch their own customizable ZK powered L2 on ethereum this is actually an evolution from their previous polygon supernets Vision which was announced in April last year which simply put served the same purposes but was not powered by ZK Tech the implementation and Adoption of the polygon cdk will transform polygon into a supernet of ZK networks working as an interoperable system and exchanging valuable resources via a shared Bridge aside from the polygon cdk and the theoretically unlimited chains it enables there's also another upcoming chain called polygon miden this is a ZK rollup running on the maiden virtual machine which will prioritize ZK friendliness over evm compatibility and where Builders can write and deploy DS to bring all these different working parts of a future polygon 2.0 ecosystem together a number of significant technical upgrades to the existing Network are necessary from protocol design to tokenomics and governance at the protocol level polygon 2.0 will Implement four layers that operate together to deliver a compact system of networks with mutual communication these four layers are the staking layer the interop or interoperability layer the execution layer and the proving layer first up is the staking layer this is where polygon's Native token will be staked to provide security and decentralization to all polygon chains tasks like maintaining the validator registry processing staking and unstaking requests and slashing happen here additionally every polygon chain can also customize their desired level of decentralization by specifying the required number of validators each chain can even opt to Define any additional requirements Rewards or specific slashing conditions for validators next the interop layer will facilitate secure and seamless cross-chain messaging within the polygon system users will feel like the whole polygon network is a single chain for example with near Inson bridging and shared access to Native ethereum assets I.E no need for synthetic or WRA tokens on different chains the execution layer enables any polygon chain to sequence transactions from the men poool and produce blocks similar to how transactions are processed in networks like ethereum and Bitcoin lastly is the proving layer which is a flexible high- performing ZK proving protocol it is in charge of efficiently generating and aggregating proofs for all executed transactions across all polygon chains aside from protocol architecture upgrades there's also brand new tokenomics to be implemented which is where the new pull token comes into play pull token contracts went live on the ethereum mayet on October 25th signifying a major Milestone so what does this mean for polygon's current madic token pole is set to power the polygon 2.0 ecosystem eventually taking over over maddox's role as the native token of polygon it's going to be used for governance gas staking and other utilities as the polygon ecosystem continues to develop the pole token will be a key component empowering the security of all the chains that operate under the polygon supernet structure which the team calls a third generation hyperproductive token which supersedes Bitcoin a nonproductive asset and ether a productive asset this is because validators on the polygon Network can also validate and earn transaction fees from any polygon chain and earn extra rewards depending on the specific plans of the network they validate according to the poll white paper the initial poll supply of 10 billion tokens is meant for the migration of madic to pull at a one:1 swap in order to ensure the success of pull as the new native token after the initial Supply pull will be released at a predefined rate of 2% per year for 10 years after which it can be decreased through governance if desired out of this 2% 1% goes towards incentivizing and retaining validators and the other 1% towards supporting the development of the polygon ecosystem the team believes that after 10 years transaction fees and other incentives will be enough to generate a return for validators and then finally the last component of polygon 2.0 is the re-imagined governance framework so this will be separated into three main pillars with differing governance models first up we have the protocol governance which relates to the decentralized maintenance and development of the polygon Tech stack then we have the system smart contracts governance relating to upgrades of protocol components which are smart cont contracts and then lastly Community treasury governance which concerns ecosystem growth and public goods funding it's worth noting that not all of this is currently set in stone with possible changes to be made based on ongoing discussions with pogon validators users developers and other ecosystem participants well it looks like polygon has quite the journey ahead to polygon 2.0 but we're excited to see what's next let us know in the comments what you think about polygon 2.0 o drop a like if this video helped you understand it a little more and if you want to know more about polygon's role in ethereum scaling

StxKobibNuc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StxKobibNuc,data is everywhere and this is especially true in the world of blockchains transactions and public blockchains are available for all to access which allows anyone such as yourself to perform onchain analysis and help gauge market trends investor sentiment and much more so this video dives into the most useful free onchain indicators that could give you valuable insights and help you stay one step ahead in the crypto Market first up on our list is active addresses active addresses refer to blockchain addresses that have received or sent out funds within a certain period as you might guess the count of active addresses is an indicator for the amount of active users or activity on a blockchain since addresses are not only tied to one individual the number of active addresses has been trending up as bitcoin's user base grows over its lifetime however there are numerous periods of sharp Rises and drops in between correlating with Rises or declines in price during periods where active addresses spiked significantly it also has marked the tops of previous Market Cycles followed by a steep drop off in active addresses while a bare Market sets in this occurs as speculators who were initially hopeful about a rise in bitcoin's price lose their short-term interest in it naturally leading to a reduction in use next up hoddle waves the hoddle waves indicator displays the market Trend and age range of a specific cryptocurrency which is Bitcoin in this case this indicator shows the duration for which an asset has been held for instance a yellow color in the hotle wave represents a holding period of 6 to 12 months while purple signifies a holding period exceeding 10 years this indicator is useful to determine how the amount of short versus long long-term holders is changing it essentially mirrors the trading patterns and potential future movements of Bitcoin for example take a look at the red and orange bands which indicate short-term holding periods we can see that short-term holders tend to increase significantly as a market cycle top forms this is because a lot of new participants tend to enter the market when Bitcoin is rapidly rising in price likely experiencing fomo new participants would buy the older coins sold to them by investors that have held the coins for much longer and thus resulting in smaller yellow green and blue bands historically this would have been a good time to be taking profits rather than buying new coins on the other hand when green and blue bands thicken it means that more Bitcoin is being held for longer which could be a decent period for accumulating more coins now let's look at at net unrealized profits and losses or NL this indicator is based on the combination of market value and realized value breaking things down market value is the same as market capitalization that is the current price of Bitcoin multiplied by its circulating Supply realize value or realize capitalization on the other hand calculates the price of each Bitcoin at its last transaction summing and averaging these out then multiplying that by the total circulating Supply unrealized profit and loss is then determined by subtracting realized value from market value this estimates the total paper profits or losses held by Bitcoin investors finally this value is then divided again with the market value in order to get net unrealized profit and loss this indicator essentially tells you the degree of Bitcoin holders and unrealized profits or losses the higher Bitcoin holders are in profit on their positions the higher the nupl value goes when a majority of Market participants are significantly in profit the Blue nupl Line enters or goes near the redband indicating potential greed in the market this is often a good time for strategic investors to take profits by assessing Bitcoins and UPL value in various stages of the market cycle long-term investors can better understand Market sentiment and make informed decisions with their bags moving on we have market value to realized value or the mvrv Z score so the mvrv zcore helps to determine periods when Bitcoin is significantly overvalued or undervalued compared to its fair value on the chart market value as explained earlier is indicated by by the black line realize value which we have just learned about is indicated by the blue line which can be interpreted as bitcoin's fair value and then there is the zcore which is indicated by the Orange Line This is a standard deviation test that makes extremes between market and realized value stand out on the chart historically the mvrv zcore has been great at picking out Market tops where market value is unusually high above realized value you can observe these periods on the chart where the zcore or orange line enters the pink box which marked previous Market cycle tops within 2 weeks furthermore when the zcore enters the green box it indicates a period when marked value is significantly lower than realized value marking bottoms which have historically made for great buying opportunities for an indicator that's related to the hoddle waves that we mentioned earlier we have our hodle realized value hodle ratio this indicator uses a ratio of realized value hoddle waves similar to hodle waves realize value hodle waves are different age bands of coins weighted by the realized value of coins within each band as explained earlier realized value can be thought of as the fair value for Bitcoin this metric looks at the ratio between the r hodle bands of one week and 1 to two Years also factoring in the age of coins in the market influenced by long-term hodling or long lost coins when the onewe value considerably exceeds that of 1 to 2 years it indicates an overheating Market this is due to an unusually high amount of new coins acquired at elevated prices which signals fomo in the market as a result the r hodle ratio will approach the red BAS and signaling a frothy Market historically such periods have been good times for investors to realize gains during each cycle like mvrv our hodle ratio is good for identifying periods where bitcoin's price is at the extremes it can signal cycle tops when the r hodle ratio line approaches the upper red band and indicates an incoming rally after bitcoin's price has spent time in the lower green band The R hodle ratio works on high High time frames and could be more suitable for long-term investors compared to mvrv last but not least we have the pel multiple this indicator examines bitcoin's Supply aspect focusing on Miners and their earnings it analyzes Market Cycles through the lens of mining income Bitcoin miners are often considered for sellers due to the need to offset the constant cost of equipment and operational costs in a fluctuating Market their revenues can impact the price over time the peel multiple is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of Bitcoins and USD by the 365-day moving average of daily issuance value at times the quantity of newly mined Bitcoins entering the system is either excessively high or low compared to historical Norms when the PE multiple line reaches the upper Red Band on the chart minor revenues are significantly higher than historical norms and vice versa over most of bitcoin's Lifetime these periods have been confluent with bitcoin's Market cycle tops when the value of the PE multiple dips into the green box it has historically rewarded buyers in this Zone with outsized gains in contrast when the value is high and enters the red box above it becomes a cell signal well that was it are there any other free onchain indicators that you like to use well if you want to learn more about other types of Bitcoin

GMO4Stv749k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMO4Stv749k,"are you on the lookout for an airdrop well we might have one for you but it does come along with some concerns so make sure you stick until the end to find out what people are saying today we're looking into blast a new ethereum layer 2 solution all right let's get into it so what exactly is blast well it's a new ethereum optimistic rollup that setting itself apart from others by offering native yield for both eth and stable coins like usdc USD and D most ler two chains that we know of have their sight set on scalability but blast wants to let your assets also generate yield on their own the process behind the platform's yield involves eth staking and realworld asset protocols to promise users the enticing automatic returns of 4% for eth and 5% for stable coins currently we'll be diving into the details in just a bit first let's take a look at who's running the show blast is founded by Pac-Man the founder of blur which is a leading nft Marketplace aggregator that recently surpassed open CA in market share not a small feat joining his team are members from Top tier institutions like Fang yil MIT nanyang Technological University and soul National University blast also claims that the team members have worked on some of the largest protocols in Def and web 3 on chains like ethereum and Solana altogether contributors successfully raised 20 million from Paradigm standard crypto eirl Capital primitive Ventures Andrew Kang Larry surmac Jeff low and other crypto natives so how is blast promising native yield on your eth and stable coins well it's rather simple actually when you deposit your tokens to other layer twos the equivalent tokens are escro and smart cont contracts on corresponding layer ones these tokens are not utilized but that's exactly what blast is trying to change by converting deposited eth and stable coins to St eth and die to earn yields from staking rewards and treasuries basically blast puts assets deposited on its L2 platform to work auring yield for their holders when users Bridge eth into blast the tokens are staked with the liquid staking protocol Lio Finance which provides stakers a yield of about 4% of users though this could change in the future when it comes to stable coins they're automatically deposited in onchain treasury bill protocols through maker Dow these work similarly to traditional T bills by offering a return over a set period and in this case thanks to all the rate hikes roughly a sweet 5% yield depositors will receive blast Auto rebasing stablecoin usdb which can be redeemed for usdc when bridged back to ethereum this approach by blast aims to provide users with a new passive income stream like other l2s blast also provides evm compatibility and cheaper gas fees it is also trying to set itself apart by offering 100% of gas Revenue back to developers and additional incentives for users currently you'll need an invitation to use blast which is in its Early Access phase its Early Access phase began in November 2023 with a community airdrop program that's divided equally between Early Access members and developers users who want to join the airdrop program will need an invite link to access the blast platform and then connect their Twitter and Discord accounts an initial set of points will be given to them based on their wallet's historical activity and they can start earning blast points through a few ways like bridging assets staking and referring other others once users are onboarded they will be given invite links to let their friends join blast too here's where things get a little bit interesting every person that you invite will give you 16% bonus points on the points they earn and from these direct invites anyone they invite will earn you an additional 8% in bonus points on the points they earn so it's supposed to be like one big chain of of bonus points the blast token airdrop is scheduled for May 2024 and members can redeem their blast points as a measure of their contribution to the platform the more points you collect the higher your airdrop allocation developers will sadly need to wait a little longer for the developer airdrop that is set to go live in January when the blast test net launches it aims to incentivize developers to build and innovate on the blast platform it sure seems like there's some excitement around blast because within just 1 week of Early Access blast reached 570 million in total value locked with over 63,000 community members since then the figure has grown to 913 million at the time of shooting but hold on before you start running over to blast you should know that the network isn't actually live yet instead they've deployed a multi-sig wallet for users to be a able to prefunds deposited by Early Access members are locked in a bridge contract until February 2024 when the full mayet is set to be launched and anyone can start accessing blast now let's get a little serious and talk about the concerns that people are expressing when it comes to blast one of which is the exclusive collaboration with maker da and heavy Reliance on Lio Finance some users have pointed out that this dis poses a potential single point of failure and that relying on Lio Finance for eth staking yield also raises concerns about centralization especially since Lio Finance dominates the eth liquid staking derivatives Market with almost 33% of all staked eth and remember that referral program that they're running well some folks have raised concerns about the referral system comparing it to a per pit scheme since each direct invite will give bonus points down the line on top of that and most importantly there's no actual layer 2 Chain yet instead funds are being locked in a three out of five multi-sig wallet this means if three of the signers are compromised or conspiring together user deposits could be drained Dan Robinson from Paradigm took to Twitter to express the investment firm's disappointment with BL decision to launch the bridge contract before the layer 2 and not allowing withdrawals for 3 months saying that it sets a bad precedent for other projects blast marketing tactics were also described to cheapen the work of the team before he ended the Tweet by saying that they don't endorse these kind of tactics and take their responsibility in the ecosystem seriously blast founder Pac-Man has also gone to Twitter to address some of these concerns and clarify that Paradigm had zero involvement in Blast goto Market strategy and had in fact asked for changes as well as why the referral system exists to reward users stating that a city is nothing without its people overall blast presents an exciting opportunity to earn passive income on your ethereum and stable coins but remember to do your own research because due diligence is always key so there you have it an overview of blast and its road map how Native yield is possible and some of the concerns surrounding it if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up and let us know your thoughts in the comments and if you want to know if ethereum is safe from attacks well then check out

yVl8m5WLVuE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVl8m5WLVuE,if you've not been caught up Celestia's mayet has gone live making it arguably the first modular blockchain Network in the space Celestia's mayet launch has managed to Garner itself a decent amount of hype not to mention Celestia's token Tia's recent jump in price likely means it's not going to get any less attention for a while but what is a modular blockchain anyway how does celestia work and why is it important well if blockchain Innovation pequs your interest you don't want to miss this video before we get into the tech and explain modularity let's introduce Celestia's impressive founding team first Celestia's lab's CTO is Ismael coffee a former senior engineer at tender Min and interchain Foundation second Chief research officer John Adler was previously a scalability researcher at consensus and known for creating optimistic rollups last but not least the Mastermind of Celestia Labs Mustafa alasam also the co-founder of chains space which was acquired by Facebook he is also a security researcher and hacker in fact at 16 years old alasam was actually the co-founder of hacker group lazac Infamous for numerous high-profile breaches such as Sony Fox FBI and even the CIA back in 2011 we were banned from um encrypting stuff for about 5 years now fast forward to this day he now has a PHD in blockchain scaling and is the CEO of Celestia Labs besides what is a strong lineup at the helm of Celestia the project is by no means lacking in funding the recent funding round in October brought its total funding at about 57 million including backing by numerous notable firms such as Galaxy Bane Capital crypto binance labs and coinbase Ventures now having a solid team and funding is great but what exactly is Celestia doing to address the challenges that most blockchains face today well to understand we first need to recap some blockchain Basics so blockchains are made of several components execution which deals with processing transactions settlement which deals with dispute resolution validity of blocks and acts as a bridging layer consensus which orders transactions and data availability which ensures data is available and published on chain note that execution settlement and consensus all require da pay attention to the data availability part as it's important to understand later on in monolithic blockchains a single blockchain performs all of these functions on its own in a single layer examples include Bitcoin ethereum or Solana that is excluding the layer twos and other scaling Solutions built on top this classic monolithic design is the reason for the infamous blockchain trilemma which describes the problem where Builders can only pick two out of the three main properties of a blockchain and sacrifice the third I.E security decentralization and scalability since blockchains cannot compromise on security the most common choice is between scalability and decentralization for example increases in Block size to increase throughput leads to more expensive Hardware requirements for nodes to validate the blockchain resulting in a more centralized Network as less people can afford the hardware to secure the network this creates problems with scaling while keeping the blockchain secure and decentralized let's look at where modular blockchains come into play modularity refers to designs which split a system into smaller exchangeable or replaceable Parts allowing for more flexible and customizable designs whereby monolithic blockchains need to do everything which reduces efficiency modular ones can choose to spe initialize and optimize on only a few functions instead an example we are all familiar with are ethereum rollups which are modular blockchains which Focus only on execution while offloading settlement consensus and data availability to the main net now what's different with Celestia however is that it focuses only on consensus and data availability that is ordering blocks and ensuring that block data is really published on chain Celestia provides a solution to this by introducing and implementing a new feature data availability sampling or Das a concept formalized by alasam back in 2018 as mentioned earlier increasing block size in traditional blockchains compromises decentralization due to higher Hardware requirements with the help of a data protection technique called eraser coding which we won't get into in this video Das provides a solution to this by allowing light notes to randomly sample small amounts of block data in order to verify data availability as a light note repeatedly samples block data it increases the confidence that data is available once the light note hits a particular confidence level say 99% % it then confirms the availability of the block data furthermore when the number of light notes involved in sampling grows so does the Network's capacity to safely manage larger volumes of data and thus enabling increases in Block size without increasing the cost to secure the network now this can all sound a little vague and confusing so we've linked a tweet by Celestia coo Nick white which explains the process with a simple coin flip analogy now all this provides a decentralized and secure way to publish and store blocked data ensuring that the data is available for anyone to read and verify which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of a blockchain Celestia's modular approach also allows different DS or execution environments to run on top of it without being limited by the constraints of the underlying blockchain this means anything from App specific chains or even general purpose layer 2os which run on different VMS or programmed in different languages can be built on top of Celestia and benefit from the data availability provided theoretically the modular design inherently addresses scalability issues since Celestia only handles data availability and consensus it can process and store large amounts of data more efficiently than traditional blockchains Celestia's native token Tia will be used by rollup developers to pay for data availability on the network besides that Tia can also be delegated to a validator to secure the network while earning staking rewards as well as voting in Celestia's decentralized governance proposals Celestia has established a total supply of 1 billion Tia tokens at Genesis with an inflation schedule of 8% in the first year decreasing 10% per year until reaching an inflation floor of 1.5% annually as for token allocation 17.6% is allocated to contributors of Celestia Labs 35.6% is allocated to seed and early investors 26.8% is allocated for R&D and ecosystem and 20% is reserved for public initiatives such as celesia Genesis drop although Celestia's mayet went live not long ago on October 31st its ecosystem is already hosting an abundance of apps and services Celestia's ecosystem web page currently features 57 apps and services with notable mentions such as optimism's op stack and Cosmos SDK as rollup Frameworks considering that Celestia's mayet has only recently been launched the full extent of innovation and possibilities enable abled by its modular blockchain remains to be seen in the unfolding future do you think modular blockchains like Celestia is the answer that we need to solve the blockchain trilemma perhaps you would like to refresh your understanding of how nodes in a blockchain work well then check out our explainer on

cvla5V0PPog,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvla5V0PPog,how do you keep track of your defi positions if you manually note them down or maybe rely on your memory well then you have to start making use of defi portfolio trackers these platforms provide a convenient centralized view of all your onchain assets across different daps and networks which comes in super handy if you have parked funds in various pockets of web 3 so let's look at some of the most popular one starting with one of the earliest di5 portfolio trackers in the market Zion xerion supports 12 networks including ethereum B&B chain Avalanche and Solana it's available both as a mobile app for iOS an Android and a web platform when you connect a wallet to xerion you will get an overview of your portfolio and this has details on asset values 24-hour changes and transaction history on top of that zeron has a feature enabling inapp trading and a bridge for transferring tokens between different blockchains another notable feature is known as perks which allows you to discover what specific opportunities your address may be eligible for like airdrops for example xerion also introduced what they call a dynamic nft Avatar or DNA this nft evolves with each action taken in the connected xeron wallet basically serving as an onchain footprint its appearance reflects the networks you use assets you hold and even the gas you spent plus they can also be sold on the secondary Market next up we have nanson portfolio previously known as a board before its acquisition by nanson the portfolio tracker is only available as a web app and supports 48 chains including ethereum Tron Solana and the B&B chain when you access the platform you'll be met with an overview of your assets here you can see metrics like the total value of your Holdings accumulated rewards and even outstanding debts across different platforms and chains next to the portfolio tab the transactions tab gives a record of your transaction history then there is the analytics section designed to help you keep tabs on your portfolio's performance over time and even allows you to compare your portfolio against Market benchmarks like Bitcoin and ethereum rounding it off is the wallet profiler section which gives detailed insights on any wallet address covering everything from token Holdings to transaction history however do note that if you want to unlock its full capabilities you'll need a nansense subscription which starts from $100 a month moving on we have zapper which supports 12 networks including ethereum BC Avalanche and base zapper like the other platforms on the list tracks your crypto tokens across multiple wallets and allows you to see your tokens real time value on top of that if you wish to move assets the platform offers a bridge and a swap feature to facilitate transactions within the platform when you're swapping your tokens the platform scans several decentralized exchanges to ensure optimal pricing plus active users in the platform can earn badges which are basically nfds that can be traded in the secondary Market the platform also comes with an address book useful for storing multiple wallet details or even tracking the portfolios of other investors you can access these features either through the mobile app for IOS and Android or via their web platform up next is De bank which supports 67 chains including ethereum B&B Avalanche and Phantom with the Bank you can track your assets via the mobile app or the web app first you'll have to log into the platform with a web3 wallet and once there your profile displays an aggregate of all assets linked to your wallet from there you can navigate to the transaction section to access your most recent transaction data or the approval section which showcases the protocols authorized to access your tokens and further provides the option to revoke such permissions the DAP also has a stream tab which functions similarly to pop popular social media platforms like X and it rewards users based on their contributions to the platform similar to zapper debank also issues nft badges to users who meet certain criteria it's also worth noting that the bank announced that they will be introducing paid features to their platform next on our list is coin stats a platform accessible across Android iOS and on web browsers which supports over 10 chains including ethereum Bitcoin BC polygon and Avalanche at the heart of coin stats is its portfolio tracker by connecting your wallet or sex Exchange accounts like binance coinbase and crypto.com you can gain an overview of your Investments showcasing details like portfolio value individual coin metrics and profit or loss data on top of tracking assets coin stats offers a built-in swap feature that facilitates inapp crypto trading while coin stats earn integrates with select dii protocols such as urine finance and Lio offering you opportunities for staking and yield farming it also offers integration with the coin Ledger app to assist in tax report generation keep in mind that while coin stats provides various features for free accessing its full Suite of capabilities requires a subscription priced at a minimum of $7.49 per month as an honorable mention we have llama folio by defi llama llama folio was just launched to support 15 blockchains including ethereum Phantom B&B and Avalanche upon connecting your wallet it provides an overview of assets inclusive of debts and claimable rewards within specific protocols in the transaction section you can dive into the transaction history of your connected wallet the other feature is known as the wallet book which allows you to track multiple wallets lolio has announced plans to further improve its platform promising more

BqEI-lGEiLs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqEI-lGEiLs,"in case you missed it we have a new layer 2 in town squirrel's highly anticipated mayet has just gone live since it's Bridge deployment on October 8th over 15,980 e has been bridged onto scroll according to Dune analytics not to mention that scroll has raised 80 million back in March from investors such as pulley chain Sequoia and Bane Capital crypto just to name a few although there is no official word on Scrolls valuation it is estimated that it sits at around 1.8 billion in this video we'll explain all about scroll and how it Stacks up against other similar l2s scroll is an open-source bite code compatible ZK evm layer 2 that focuses on Native level compatibility with existing ethereum daps and tools scroll is founded by mathematician yay Chong systems engineer hen and web 3 researcher Sandy who wanted to use ZK rollup to tackle ethereum scalability issues if you've watched any of our previous videos on l2s you're aware by now that there are two main types of layer twos optimistic Roll-Ups and zero knowledge Roll-Ups which are being developed to tackle E's scalability issues optimistic rollups are generally more evm compatible and execute smart contract code in similar ways as ethereum's virtual machine however it takes about a week to bridge out of optimistic rollups and receive your withdrawn funds and depends on a fraud proof system to report any invalid transactions on the other hand ZK rollups have the validity of their transactions mathematically proven and have much quicker withdrawal periods about 24 to 48 hours however Z rollups are less evm compatible as they tend to be complex and inflexible resulting in smart contracts being more difficult to implement at the same time Time Zero knowledge proofs also demand a lot of computing power to generate to enable Smart contract functionality ZK rups use a ZK evm which is a virtual machine that is able to execute smart contract transactions while being compatible with ZK proof computations this however adds more challenge to generating ZK proofs due to the increased complexity of smart contract transactions to build a ZK evm that is compatible for adapts while efficient at generating proofs scroll utilizes a hierarchical zero knowledge proof system the system contains two separate layers adopting different zero knowledge proof systems the first layer generates proofs for a different dap to ensure fast proving with short proving keys and high scalability by using low complexity proofs the second layer then generates proofs from the proofs made in the first layer essentially this layer acts as a wrapping layer this results in shorter proofs and a more evm compatible proving system scroll also claims that their ZK evm is bite code compatible which allows developers to deploy pre-existing smart contracts from ethereum directly on scroll without modifying the underlying code this helps scroll to achieve an identical development and user EXP experience to ethereum's Virtual Machine besides this scroll implements a permissionless layer 2 mining mechanism basically scroll outsources the second layer proof wrapping to miners which is similar to bitcoin's proof of work mining in this case miners on scroll are incentivized to generate zero knowledge proofs for transactions as quickly as possible this helps scroll to get it its computational power from miners for proof generation since transaction packing is separate from mining this mitigates maximal extractable value risks otherwise known as meev which you can learn about in our video which will link in the description below let's look at how scroll Compares with another ZK rollup such as ZK sync era ZK sync era prioritizes speed in its proof generation over evm equivalence this means that while ZK sync era tends to be faster in finalizing transactions it requires developers to make tweaks to their code in order to deploy daps on ZK sync era scroll on the other hand focuses more on evm compatibility and decentralization with bite Cod level compatibility scroll makes for a more friendly ZK rollup for developers to work with additionally scroll's novel implementation of its mining for its proof generation helps distinguish itself as one of the more decentralized L2 protocols out there all this however comes at a cost for Scrolls proof generation speed and transactions would take longer to finalize as compared to other speed oriented ZK rollups such as ZK sync era currently Scrolls ecosystem is hosting notal projects like kyber swap dodo isumi finance and more according to defi Lama scroll currently has in total 16.86 million locked on its defi daps this figure is much lower than other ZK rollup ecosystems but it is understandable given how new this ecosystem is as Scrolls mayet just went live not long ago it will just be a matter of time before big players like a and Sushi start deploying their DBS on scroll as they are already deployed on testnet at the moment so far the network has seen over 57,000 transactions made by over 52,000 unique addresses if you wouldd like to start AOS depositing into scroll to participate in its ecosystem go to scroll. and hit the big button at the top and it will take you to Scrolls portal to get started add Scrolls configuration to your wallet by clicking on add to metamask then scroll down and click on bridge to get started with bridging simply connect your wallet to the bridge select a crypto and simply confirm the transaction and you will be receiving your crypto on Scrolls mainnet moving forward scroll aims to be more decentralized and censorship resistant as scroll has designed a proof generation system powered by miners their next step is gradually decentralizing their sequencer which is the component that puts transactions into a batch to be rolled up as one and sent to layer one to date every single rollup runs on a centralized sequencer decentralizing the sequencer allows the community to run their own sequencers so that transactions cannot be censored besides this scroll has been an open-source project from the start and is committed to stay public and open inviting the community to work on scroll's development openly in fact scroll is actually in collaboration with privacy and scaling Explorations a research and development team supported by the ethereum foundation scroll also claims that they will be adding experimental new features to expand their evm capabilities to enable developers to create Fuller user experiences while there is no official announcement on a token yet a scroll token is probably a question of not if but when while there has already been quite a bit of airdrop speculation for using Scrolls test net none has been announced so far so it may still be worth experimenting with now that its mayet is launched squirrel's team was asked about a token during an interview and simply said that they couldn't answer for legal reasons as to what that means I will leave it up for you to decide as for now scroll's value proposition lies in its composability and ease of development for ethereum Native developers while it may not be the fastest ZK rollup it aims to deliver a seamless developing experience for Builders looking to deploy their daps on a ZK evm so what are your thoughts on scroll do you think that scroll has what it takes to be a Cornerstone project in the ZK evm space well perhaps you would like to learn about another ZK evm project by metam mass developer consensus

qDDbr_jDfkA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDDbr_jDfkA,"do you know Bitcoin is currently up over 100% since the year began with how the markets are looking lately you might start to think if a new bull market is on the horizon but where can you expect Bitcoin to go if the bull market is back well in today's video we'll look at some bitcoin price predictions from notable figures and institutions let's start things off with a $445,000 Bitcoin prediction by JP Morgan analysts at JP Morgan mention that Rising gold prices could mean a 45,000 Bitcoin as their price movements are correlated and seen as similar alternatives to investors besides that JP Morgan is expecting Bitcoins next having around April 2024 to double miners production cost to 40,000 per Bitcoin which would establish a new price floor for Bitcoin JP Morgan also acknowledges that in the past bitcoin's production costs have acted as a price floor for the asset and that previous Bitcoin since then standard charted has renewed its prediction to $120,000 per Bitcoin now this is because miners are expected to keep more Bitcoin as they anticipate its price to increase and at the same time can sell less Bitcoin to cover their operational costs when bitcoin's price is higher back in July standard charted estimated that miners have been selling 100% of their new coins however if Bitcoin gets to 50,000 by the end of 2023 the bank is expecting miners to sell only 20 to 30% of their newly mined Bitcoin if this is true this would significantly reduce the supply of new Bitcoins entering the market and cause Bitcoin to appreciate in price assuming all other factors are still in play now to most Bitcoin Bulls a $100,000 Bitcoin is not a matter of if but when but what about a 100,000 Bitcoin by the end of March 2024 in August blockstream CEO and crypto OG Adam back tweeted that he agrees with the sentiment on bitcoin reaching $100,000 albeit much earlier than most would believe what's more is that he agreed to bet a million with another crypto Twitter user that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by March 31st of 2024 now whether you're excited on seeing Bitcoin run up to $100,000 early next year or shocked at the size of the bet just know that they agreed to bet a million SATs which is just about $354 at the current bitcoin price crypto hedge fund pantia Capital dove into bitcoin's performance around its having events and found a bullish forecast by comparing bitcoin's previous performance around its having events bitcoin's price bottoms about 477 days prior to a having steadily climbs and rallies for another 480 days after the having now based on this data Bitcoin should have bottomed on December 30th 2022 but pantia claims that the actual low occurred on November 9th of 2022 during the collapse of FTX using the framework around bitcoin's having event Penta states that Bitcoin would reach $35,000 before the having and eventually hit1 48,000 for now the first part of the prediction has come true with Bitcoin hitting 35,000 recently but we'll just have to see if panta is right about a 148,000 Bitcoin in 2025 by now you should be no stranger to Black Rock surprise spot Bitcoin ETF filing this year and the amount of Buzz that it has generated Chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management Mark yuso seems to be pretty excited about black Rock's ETF filing and made a prediction on bitcoin hitting $150,000 one of his reasons is the potential inflows that Black Rock Spot Bitcoin ETF could bring yuso estimates that there's only about 100 billion worth of readily available Bitcoin in the market he notes that black rock has about 30 trillion of capital and that if 0.1% of these funds goes into the ETF that is 30 billion Bitcoins purchased from a supply of 100 billion coupled with the reduced supply of newly mined Bitcoin after the next bitcoin's having event yuso believes Bitcoin would get a parabolic rally sending its price to $150,000 although a spot Bitcoin ETF by Black Rock seems increasingly likely to be approved it will still be anyone's guess until it's here if you've been in crypto for a while you will know Arthur Hayes former CEO of bitmex that frequently publishes controversial takes on the macroeconomic environment around financial markets on a podcast Episode by Tom billu Arthur mentioned that a combination of the upcoming Bitcoin having and the FED possibly cutting rates to float the financial Market could send the price of Bitcoin to its all-time high at about $70,000 by the end of 2024 however he is also expecting Bitcoin to continue rallying in a parabolic fashion potentially reaching $700,000 to a million dollar per Bitcoin well if if this price prediction isn't bald enough Arthur also shared that given the current macroeconomic and geopolitical situation he believes that a depression as severe as the Great Depression comes after Bitcoin and other assets hit their tops Now call this prediction crazy but that's Arthur Hayes for you and now the final prediction on our list is by Arc invest CEO Kathy Wood Kathy Wood has made bold predictions on numerous assets over the years including Bitcoin this time however Kathy seems to be just as or perhaps even more bullish than ever on bitcoin compared to her prediction in 2020 Kathy Wood believes in the importance of Bitcoin as the world's first decentralized Global digital and rules-based monetary system it is a very big idea while the current total crypto market capitalization is at about 1.2 trillion Cathy wood believes that the crypto Market as a whole will reach 25 trillion with more than half of its valuation represented by Bitcoin this puts bitcoin's market capitalization at over 13 trillion which is more than 19 times what the Bitcoin Market is currently valued at at around 688 billion so her reason is the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC driving up the demand of increasingly scarce Bitcoin due to bitcoin having a fixed supply of 21 million BTC over 90% of which has been mind Kathy Wood believes that the institutional inflow brought on by approved spot ETFs will bring forth a notable increase in demand for an increasingly restricted supply of Bitcoin she believes that institutions will have no choice but to buy up Bitcoin sending the price of Bitcoin and its spot ETFs higher with all this wood made two predictions on bitcoin's price a bare case of $682,000 and a a bull case of a whopping 1.48 Million by the year 2030 now 1.48 million per BTC may seem a lot but it's worth noting that 7 years is a lot of time in crypto terms and Bitcoin has been known to defy expectations one way or another so whose prediction do you agree with or perhaps do you have your own well let us know in the comments below

so you know what's happening let's start by taking a look at Solana's underlying Tech Solana was once notoriously plagued by outages with 14 incidents of downtime in 2022 alone this was mainly caused by congestion and a series of bugs some of which were the result of growing Network usage however the devs have been hard at work and Solana hasn't seen a network outage since February 25th 2023 an all-time high in days online for the chain this network uptime is thanks to various technical upgrades that were ruled out in the past year such as a new data transfer protocol known as quick a stake weighted quality of service that guarantees validators always have a right to transmit transaction packets to the leader and local Fe fee markets that allow users to send Priority fees to validators resulting in less spam and more efficient block space markets Solana has also made improvements in client diversity clients are software implementations of the blockchain which enable computers to participate as nodes in a network diverse clients are important for blockchain resilience and decentralization as it minimizes the risk of bugs in any single client compromising the entire chain not long ago ethereum was the only major L1 with multiple clients for instance polygon Avalanche and Cosmos only run on a single client Solana also only ran on one validator client developed by Solana Labs before jto Labs released an meev optimized fork in August 2022 currently there are two other upcoming clients in the works fire Dancer by jump crypto whose launch is expected in the first half of 2024 and Sig by crypto infrastructure company syndica both these clients are expected to bring about more performance improvements in terms of throughput and reliability not one to shy away from innovative solutions Solana Labs has unveiled solang a new compiler that's designed to smooth the transition for ethereum virtual machine developers into the Solana ecosystem Solana is well known for using rust or C to write smart contracts but with with soang developers can use solidity the primary programming language for ethereum smart contracts to write test and deploy smart contracts on Solana some key highlights of solang is its compatibility with ethereum solidity 0.8 ability to call on other Solana smart contracts the integration of SPL tokens with solidity and access to Native Solana built-in functionality did you think the day you see a web 3 smartphone would come so soon back in April Solana unveiled Saga its very own Android flagship phone that features a 50 megapixel Main and 12 mapel Ultra wide dual camera system plus a 16 megapixel selfie camera it has a 6.67 in fhd plus AMOLED screen runs on Android 13 and has a rear fingerprint scanner The Saga also offers web 3 Integrations like a seed vault as the native custody solution to secure your wallet seed phase and a native store for your favorite decentralized apps sadly the Saga was met with negative reviews with popular YouTuber MKBHD stating that the features didn't justify the $1,000 price tag we've covered a lot already but there's more coming the strong performance of the Solana virtual machine and Solana's overall Tech stack has caught the eye of Outsiders driving up adoption Solana nodes are now available for deployment on Amazon web services or AWS using blockchain node Runners an open-source Initiative for deploying selfservice blockchain nodes this unlocks an easy way for Enterprises and businesses around the world to be able to deploy their own salana validators other than salana ethereum is the only other blockchain supported by AWS so you know this is no small feat early in September Visa announced it was expanding its usdc settlement pilot to Solana the Visa crypto team stated they believe Solana can help power mainstream payment flows thanks to its cheap and predictable fees parallel transaction processing fast transaction finality its large number of nodes and multiple validator clients but Visa isn't the only mainstream payment platform that wants Solana at the end of August Solana pay integrated with Shopify allowing Merchants to accept salana native usdc

Creations but not all that Glitters Is gold geckos behind those shimmering jpegs lie a few that are nothing but soulless rug pooling projects so buckle up and prepare to have your eyebrows raised cuz we're taking a stroll On the Dark Side of nft our first stop on this roller coaster of cash grabs takes us to the Curious incident of the old Roost Club brace yourselves because this one is a real doozy picture this old Roost are flying off the Solana shelves like hot cakes but just as the frenzy reaches its peak one of the projects Founders apparently dies though the crypto Lord must have pied old Roose Club because shortly after the nfts started pumping and lo and behold the founder was miraculously brought back from the dead 16 minutes after the holy resurrection of the founder magic Eden announced a transition to an optional royalties model which also meant that old Roose club would be making a lot less money now this saddened the founder so much that he simply keeled over and died again will we ever find out if the founder gets to come back to life again only time and perhaps the price of old Roose Club can tell it was supposed to be the Pokémon of nfts the next big AAA project to Grace onchain gaming with $70 million raised it certainly had the budget to match and the various teasers they put out certainly had all the investors on the edge of their seats Shut Up And Take My Money Pixelmon was supposed to be the very best like no one ever was but fate had other plans for it on February 26 came the reveal the big day for Pixelmon and its entire Community many investors had spent more than $9,000 but the art that the holders got was so bad that they became an instant Meme and it gets worse turns out a lot of the pixelmon art was literally just bought off the unity store the same art that investors had just spent obscene amounts on floor price of the nfts plummeted but out of this big Cesspool of bad art and angry mobs a superstar was born Kevin Kevin was so lovable and infectious that despite all the fud his fans decided to launch his own separate collection called the lives of Kevin these days pixelon seems to be looking better after the fix came in but this should serve as a cautionary tale to all of us here when it comes to spending hard-earned money on jpegs next up on our list we have the man the myth the absolute Legend Ty Lopez for the uninitiated Tai is known for his flashy marketing campaigns that flood our YouTube sessions you know the guy who proudly showcased his Lamborghini in his here in my garage business class promo here in my garage just bought this uh new Lamborghini here inspired by his iconic video Lopez decided to venture into the world of nfts and introduced a collection actually named the OG original garage Social Club these exclusive gems came with extraordinary perks like cozy movie Nights Unforgettable dining experiences and even private mentorship sessions for basketball fans you can even challenge Lopez to a round of horse and stand a chance to win $110,000 for just the price of $50,000 so far the original garage Social Club has only sold out around 10% of its total Supply still this didn't stop Lopez from declaring that he crashed the whole damn blockchain we crashed the whole damn blockchain ah crypto zooo another nft blockchain game fashioned after the popular Pokemon franchise The Man Behind crypto zoo is none other than Mega influencer Logan Paul unfortunately the fun game Logan Paul promised never launched oh and also the handmade art that apparently took half a year to make turned out to just be Photoshop stock photos all hell broke loose when a series of expose videos by YouTuber coffeezilla got published and along with it some serious allegations and evidence of how Logan Paul has been scamming investors Furious Logan Paul threatened to sue coffeezilla but this only stirred more hate towards Logan the very next day Logan had a change of heart and announced that he wouldn't be pursuing legal action against coffeezilla anymore in fact he was so grateful for the wakeup call that he pledged to pay back $1.3 million to all of the poor investors but the Saga didn't stop there on February 2nd 2023 a bombshell lawsuit was Unleashed against cryptozoo and Logan Paul accusing them of fraud breach of contract and a laundry list of other offenses except this time it seems it's going to take more than an apology and a million dollars to make it go away another juicy nft drama this time our main character is none other than Nicole Benham a web3 influencer and former journalist you may have seen her name in the Los Angeles Business Journal and The Hollywood Reporter but most recently she found herself smack dab in the middle of a classic pump and dump Fiasco benam had been hyping up blocky Doge 3 all over Twitter when the public mint went live benam received 250 blocky Doge 3 nfts in her wallet but instead of holding on to them like a loyal supporter benam was quietly dumping the nfts all while hyping them up at the same time caught red-handed the influencer took to Twitter to issue an apology there were mistakes made in a wallet that I controlled filled with regrets she signed off with listening learning moving forward many people started calling her out and pretty soon the memes of her non-apology started rolling in in the end CT went out because the wallet which sold the nfts decided to sweep the floor with the earnings and donated all the purchased nfts to the community wallet guest benam did listen learn and move forward after all and there you have it folks the top five worst nft cash grabs to date do not be fooled by some of their cuddly appearance geckos before you know it poverty strikes and the rug is pulled out from under you

dsgDE97i9A4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsgDE97i9A4,is ethereum as safe as most think it is it's understandable that ethereum striving to become a global permissionless and credibly neutal smart contract platform could be perceived as a threat for the powers that be so how is ethereum protecting itself any party which might want to see ethereum fall or manipulated for their own gain could launch various types of attacks against the network however we'd be very wrong to think that ethereum doesn't have any defenses of its own some people might think that an attacker can make new eth appear out of thin air or randomly drain eth from any account but this is not the case as transactions still need to satisfy basic criteria to be approved by the network or otherwise they would simply revert so in reality there are three main things that an attacker could hope to achieve first there is something called reorganizations or as the techies call it reorgs this little maneuver lets attackers play around with ethereum's blocks either including or excluding specific blocks this can lead to Mischief like double spending or extracting value by manipulating transaction orders so that they could benefit by being a step ahead or behind others a reor could also be used to stop certain transactions Al together essentially censoring them from the record next is double finality which occurs when two forks or versions of the ethereum blockchain finalize at the same time think of it as two separate timelines of event both declare to be the real deal the other possible outcome might be finality delay in the ethereum world finality is like a seal of approval confirming that transactions are set in stone and can be changed so this type of attack messes with that very Foundation by stopping the network from reaching the necessary conditions to finalize sections of the chain since many applications running on ethereum especially Financial ones depend on this Swift seal of approval to function smoothly it puts a wrench in the whole system now that we've talked about what attackers might want it's time to explore how they can attack ethereum's proof of stake mechanism most attacks typically require an attacker to not only have considerable technical expertise but to have accumulated large amounts of eth in order to gain influence over the network the more e the attacker owns the more powerful the possible attacks there are a few important thresholds of eth an attacker must own in order to carry out certain attacks the first important threshold is 33% of the total stake 33% is important as it represents 1/3 of staked eth and an attacker with this amount of eth can prevent the chain from finalizing without having to finally influence the actions of other validators for instance rather than voting maliciously they can simply go offline this is because ethereum requires 2/3 or a super majority to come to consensus for finality to occur the ethereum protocol's defense for this is called an inactivity leak where inactive or offline validators will have their staked eth slowly bled away until they no longer represent 33% of the validator set this mechanism ensures that inactivity comes at a cost to validators and even if many validators are inactive the chain can eventually move forward the second threshold is slightly higher at 34% or more with a complex Attack under specific conditions which we won't go into detail here an attacker with 34% or more of the total stake could also double vote with all of their validators causing the blockchain to fork and both chains to finalize the defense against this is inbuilt into the protocol as double voting is a slash offense and the attackers 34% of total stake which is close to 15 billion today would be burnt after which the Community would need to coordinate and face the Dilemma of which Fork to continue building on what about if an attacker controls 50% of the total stake if a group controls exactly half of the staked ether they have enough power to create two separate versions of the blockchain they can then use their stake to consistently vote against the rest of the honest validators which would prevent both forks from finalizing this would lead to inactivity leak and eventually finality on both both chains the only option here is for the ethereum community to intervene and select which Fork to continue building on with that said maintaining a precise 50% stake is tough since the number of validators can change and unpredictable network issues can shift voting Power Plus even if a group could achieve this the financial and operational cost of keeping such a balance is enormous however things change if an attacker tips the scales by controlling more than half of the total stake that is 51% or more with this power they effectively have a majority vote in ethereum's decision-making they can block specific transactions and even rearrange them to benefit themselves honest validators would have no choice to follow suit as their consensus algorithms would see the attacker's chain as the heaviest or longest therefore enabling the chain to finalize the defense against this would be the inherent risk to the value of the attacker's majority stake of eth 51% of staked eth today would roughly amount to 21 billion or so which would be dramatically devalued if the community steps in and chooses an honest minority Fork the final important threshold is at 66% so at this point imagine the attacker gaining control over The Infinity Gauntlet and all Infinity Stones okay maybe not quite but you get the idea with this super majority they can unilaterally dictate the blockchain's direction without needing any backing from Anna's validators Beyond influencing future transactions they can also reverse past ones essentially having the ability to rewrite history however amassing such a huge stake comes at an enormous cost making it an impractical move also as mentioned the ethereum community can't always collectively choose to follow follow a different version of the blockchain rendering the attacker's efforts futile it's worth noting that attacks with small amounts of eth below the first thresholds are also possible but they require extremely sophisticated and finely coordinated techniques which are likely infeasible in real world conditions and not worth the trouble now you might have notied by now that for many of these extreme scenarios the last line of defense is not any Hightech code but instead people the ethereum community of developers users and enthusiasts is often referred to as the layer zero which you can picture as the Beating Heart of ethereum the community can buy Time by ejecting attackers out of the network choose to impose heavier penalties such as destroying an attacker staked eth or revoking earned rewards as a last resort the community can also decide to ignore a dishonest chain which is what happened in 2016 during the Dow exploit which remains a contentious event till this day for those who believe code is law ultimately while it might not be the most popular choice for everybody the community can endorse what they deem the honest chain and guide validators and projects to continue building on it therefore not every attack targets the code and instead can go straight for this layer zero heart attackers could spread misinformation about ethereum what it is or its future they could threaten key developers or bribe influential figures in the community to sway decision making these aren't your typical hacker attacks and don't need vast sums of money or technical skills but they can be incredibly effective at fragmenting and destabilizing the community to thwart layer zero attacks the ethereum community ensures that the public has easy access to high quality accurate information platforms like ethereum.org play a vital role by translating in-depth articles into multiple languages ensuring misinformation has fewer places to hide it's also important that the community maintains an open and inclusive culture to avoid creating avenues for Us Versus Them narratives ethereum also leans heavily on its mission statement and governance protocols by consistently returning to its core principles decentralization security scalability and sustainability the community can more easily identify and repel Bad actors well that wraps up our Deep dive into ethereum's potential attacks and defenses and also don't miss our video on me one of ethereum's most

fdtx0MG0Xgo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdtx0MG0Xgo,you know how you're always told to write your seed phrase down on a piece of paper and keep it somewhere safe or get a hardware wallet but how do you actually keep your seed phrase safe even if you do get a hardware wallet what really matters is your seed phrase anyway which is supposed to be written down on a nice little paper card few people ever really talk about the options for seed storage or the obvious problems of paper as the storage material for your crypto fortunes people have been extremely creative with seed phrase Storage Solutions but there are two security criteria and trade-offs to think about when making a decision in regards to data loss and data theft for instance where to use story or seed phrase and who other than yourself could have potential access to it is the storage medium you've chosen for your seed phrase resilient against the elements well we've looked it up and here are a few ways that you can use to potentially store your seed phrase more safely solid steel this type of storage is probably one you've heard of and understandably so as many people have noticed the glaring shortcomings of paper as a storage medium as a result there is no shortage of solid steel seed storage options out there ranging from tens to hundreds of dollars fireproof acid proof bulletproof shock proof you name it they've got approved for it if this is a tad pricey you can take the same idea for a solid steel storage and do a DIY approach there are tutorials out there of how you can make your own metal seed phrase storage device which can be cheaper plus could end up being a fun weekend project you also get the added benefit of privacy Remember The Ledger data hack sensitive customer data was leaked to Bad actors and with just a low-key DIY solution you could avoid that stone paper now this is a relatively budget-friendly and low complexity option Stone paper is a pretty Niche product on the market and it comes with the benefit of being more physically resilient being greaseproof waterproof and tear and fire resistant to some extent tamper-proof bags this is another other simple security measure keeping your seed phrase on exposed pieces of paper or somewhere where others can access means You're vulnerable to having your keys compromised and copied without your knowledge tamper evident bags make it impossible for your seed phrase to be seen by prying eyes at least not without making it obvious to you that someone has been snooping these are the type of security bags used for banking hospitals and the education sector to make sure that no one has seen or modified the contents of the bag a simpler budget-friendly alternative is simply to use shipping pliers or even sealed envelopes which are among the most common tamper evidence Storage Solutions you can find safe deposit Locker or home safe another obvious solution would be placing your seed phrase not somewhere exposed but in a safe or vault which should ideally be permanently installed and hidden this is probably more secure than those who opt to hide them and easily accessible but inconspicuous places like in books or kitchen containers of coffee flour or sugar if you're using a security scheme like shamir's secret sharing whereby a seed is split up into multiple shares of which you need a certain number to access your crypto one option is also to place one of the key shares into a safe deposit Locker which is offered by Banks or private providers as well though if you only have one seed phrase you might not want your only copy sitting remotely in a bank safe deposit where it could fall prey to a rogue Bank employee or even be legally confiscated by authorities as it presents a single point of failure using a past phrase this isn't exactly a storage method but is an additional security measure that can be used alongside physical storage to keep your funds safe in the event your seed phrase falls into the hands of others some wallets like trezor or Ledger allow the option of adding an additional passphrase which acts like a 13th or 25th word extension to your seed phrase this is different from say the password you type to unlock your metamask with this feature you could create multiple or even decoy wallets with just one seed phrase but different passphrases however we'd only recommend this for advanced users as losing your passphrase will result in losing your funds even if you have your seed phrase so it is essential that your backup plan also includes any passphrases or seed extensions that you may use brain wallet the last option is to Simply memorize your seed phrase this could be one of the riskiest options is our brain and memory is not invulnerable to time injury or disease it's worth noting that all options have their own set of benefits and trade-offs custody Solutions are highly personalized and any of the options provided can be modified or used in various combinations with each other so pick and choose which suits your individual needs most bonus safety tip you're less likely to be a Target if nobody knows you own crypto so maybe keep those stories of your wild meme coin gains to yourself and remember make sure that whatever you decide on that it's not so complex that you end up protecting your keys from yourself and if you're like me at this point you might be thinking damn how on Earth can regular people be expected to do this well there's something called account abstraction which could allow us to do away with pesky seed phrases completely

haJmC4tTMbc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haJmC4tTMbc,"can you believe that it's November already time flies and the crypto Market has been flying along with it if you haven't heard we just released our quarterly crypto industry report for Q3 covering the most important developments in the space from July to September so in this video we'll be covering the most important points and highlights that you won't want to miss starting off we have our overview of the overall crypto Market which fell by about 10% to 1.1 trillion in Q3 a significant Market downturn in mid August split the relatively boring Q3 into two parts recently however the market has surged on the back of excitement for black Rock's Bitcoin spot ETF however Bitcoin is the main beneficiary for this rather than the entire Market overall as we'll see shortly meanwhile the dominance or market share of top cryptos remained relatively unchanged though the dominance of Bitcoin was slightly down in Q3 what's not captured as measured from the start of July to the end of September was that Bitcoin dominance had back tested the 2-year range from which it broke out from last quarter evidently this was significant as Bitcoin dominance has continued to Rally along with bitcoin's latest price pump to slightly over 51% at time of shooting stable coins saw some outflow falling in market cap by about 4% despite outflows usdt increased its market share from 66% to 69% % by in September notable newcomers in this quarter include FD USD which binance has been supporting via its ongoing zero fee trading campaign curves CRV USD and PayPal's py USD on slide nine we listed some of the notable events of this past quarter some regulatory related ones to take note of include the Court ruling that xrp is not a security and GRE scale winning its SEC lawsuit to review its application to convert its gptc trust in into a spot Bitcoin ETF meanwhile SBF and suzu are also in jail turning our attention to the king of Crypt Bitcoin fell slightly lower than the overall Market being down about 12% a few notable events that could have negatively affected bitcoin's price in Q3 include the reports of SpaceX selling its Bitcoin Holdings and Chinese property developer giant igrand going bankrupt meanwhile in a move that surprises all of us does the SEC has postponed all spot Bitcoin etm decisions at the time of writing the report bitcoin's yearly High stood at $ 31,44 however that has been absolutely blasted past by its recent move which brought its price to slightly over 35,000 on many exchanges roughly 12% higher than its previous High despite sideways is price action throughout Q3 hash rate continued to climb as per usual developments in the mining industry also continued a notable one being that Vanguard the world's second largest asset manager only behind Black Rock has bought another 6.6 million shares of marathon digital and 2.7 million shares of Riot blockchain bringing its total investment in Bitcoin miners to 560 million despite the growing adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin in the trafi world countries continue to take diverging paths in Q3 Oman has opened a 350 million Mining facility while Kuwait has banned Bitcoin mining and crypto Al together as for how Bitcoin fared against other major asset classes all assets saw declines except for crude oil which was the clear winner with a 29% gain and dxy the US dollar Index which gained 3% PTC and TLT I.E long-term US Treasury bonds saw the largest losses the Fed aggressive rate hikes have led to long-term bond yield soaring and as a result their price has plummeted by 28% as of end September as a reminder bond yield and price are inversely correlated and higher yields also explain the strengthening of the US dollar moving on to the second largest crypto by market cap eth is down slightly more than Bitcoin in Q3 declining by about 14% it reached its yearly High earlier than Bitcoin back in April and has not broken it even in the recent Market rally this has not stopped the eth layer 2 space from getting busy however with l2s like mantle Linea base and shivaram all having been launched just this past quarter aside from eth l2s sayu and op BNB also launched their main net in the past quarter other trends that have caught the crypto community's attention in the past quarter include telegram Bots and social F platform FR Tech passing fad or no they have both achieved notable Milestones with telegram Bots amassing 3.2 billion in trading volume while frch has accumulated 49 million in tvl we've made videos on both telegram Bots and frch so be sure to check those out defi was not dead in Q3 having actually outperformed the overall crypto Market with only a 5% decline overall however it did go through quite a bit of a roller coaster to get there and its valuation was mainly held up and boosted towards the end of Q3 by only a few defi projects like maker and oracles chain link and Teller eth tvl dominance remained uncontested noal wins include base which accumulated 370 million tvl in about 2 months and Solana which increased its tvl by 19% following a couple of bullish developments such as Integrations with Shopify and Visa meanwhile be DC polygon and Avalanche collectively lost almost 1 billion in tvl a notable development in defi is probably realworld assets or rwas where tokenized T bills that is short-term US Government debt take the spotlight and driving the growth of this sector as of nq3 tokenized treasuries have reached a market cap of 665 million if you want to learn more about rwas we have a recent video on that which will link in the description below moving on to nfts now things are not looking too good for the nft space yet as training volume has continued to plummet by 56% in Q3 itself a continuation of dwindling volumes since February however trading activity aside there are still noteworthy developments in the space including pudgy Penguins releasing their realworld plushies on shelves and retailers across the globe Crafton publisher of GTA entering the gamei space and Pokemon trading cards now being available on chain as for the exchanges spot trading volumes are also not spared having dropped by 20% on centralized exchanges notably binance's market share which was as high as 66% earlier this year has fallen to about 44% now this is probably caused by all the fud that binance has has received recently from multiple top Executives jumping ship to it exiting from multiple markets the situation is similar on dex's where spot volumes have fallen by about 31% with Unis swap maintaining its dominance as usual notably though Sushi swap which has been a staple of the top 10 has fallen out in Q3 well that's about all that we can cover for this video be sure to read the full report Linked In the description below to get fully up to speed on the market developments of Q3 also drop a like if you found this summary and highlight useful

ztbRt8PINfk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbRt8PINfk,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, 
decentralized exchanges, or DEXs,   are constantly evolving to offer 
more than just simple spot trading. In this video, we’ll be talking about the 
top perpetual DEXs. Perpetuals are simply   a type of futures contract with no expiry date,   whose design allows for trading 
of cryptocurrencies with leverage. Before we dive right into the current top 6 in 
the market right now, remember that leverage   can both amplify potential profits and 
losses - so manage your risk accordingly!  First up, we have the most dominant perpetual DEX,   dYdX . It offers up to 10x leverage 
on most assets, with 20x available   on select pairs like ETH/USD and BTC/USD, 
and charges a fee of up to 0.50% on trades. Unlike many decentralized platforms that 
use the automated market maker or AMM model,   dYdX opts for the order book method 
common in centralized exchanges,   as the team believes it's more 
efficient. dydx’s order book   combines both on-chain and off-chain 
methods to match trades accurately. The protocol incentivizes users through its native 
$DYDX token. Liquidity providers are rewarded with   5.2% of the total token supply, while active 
traders on the protocol are allocated 14.5%. In June 2022, dYdX revealed plans to move 
from StarkEx, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution,   to its own standalone chain in the Cosmos 
ecosystem by the end of September 2023,   citing the need to further decentralize and scale.  Next up, we have GMX, which is built on 
Arbitrum and Avalanche. GMX allows perpetual   contract trading with up to 50x leverage on all 
available pairs and charges a 0.1% fee on trades. The DEX works using multi-asset pools which 
allow users to provide liquidity in exchange   for GLP tokens which represent their stake 
in the pool. They are then rewarded with 70%   of the protocol's revenue, generated from 
the fees paid by the users every time they   make a transaction. Additionally, they 
receive esGMX, short for escrowed GMX,   which can be staked for rewards or be converted to 
the protocol’s native GMX tokens through vesting. However it’s worth noting that GLP holders, who 
are the liquidity providers, are essentially   in a counterparty relationship with traders. 
This means that if traders on GMX are winning,   GLP holders lose out as trader profits 
are paid out from the liquidity pool. There is also the GMX token, which gives holders 
voting power and 30% of trading fees generated   from the platform in the form of ETH or AVAX 
depending on which chain you’re using GMX on. GMX rolled out its beta V2 in August 2023, which 
introduces new features such as new markets,   multi-collateral types, faster 
trade execution and reduced fees. . Moving on, we have gtrade, a product of 
Gains Network that operates on both the   Polygon and Arbitrum network. The 
DEX offers high leverage of up to   150x for cryptocurrencies and 
charges a 0.08% fee on trades. For liquidity provision, users deposit DAI 
into the gDAI vault to receive gDAI tokens,   which allows them to earn a piece of the 
trading fees. Winning traders receive their   gains from this Vault, while the losing side's 
losses funnel back into it to grow the vault. On top of gDAI, the DEX has a utility token 
known as GNS. The token is meant to enhance   the DAI vault's stability and offers 
inflation protection, plus, will serve   as the protocol’s governance token in future.
Next up, we have Kwenta, powered by the Synthetix   protocol. As you may already know, Synthetix is 
a protocol on Ethereum that creates 'synths',   which are synthetic assets on the blockchain 
that mirror the value of other assets, mainly   various cryptocurrencies, but also commodities 
like gold, silver, and even fiat currencies. Kwenta enables up to 25x leverage on most pairs 
and up to 50x on select pairs like BTC/sUSD,   ETH/sUSD and USDT/sUSD. The sUSD token, central to 
these pairs is a synthetic USD token issued by the   Synthetix protocol, but instead of being backed by 
actual dollars, it's collateralized by SNX tokens.   This ensures that Kwenta has liquidity, as it 
draws from SNX token holders staking on Synthetix. Kwenta charges a 0.02% or 0.06% 
fee on trades and has its own   native token known as KWENTA which can be 
staked to earn rewards and voting power.  Up next is Level finance, which is built on 
the BNB Chain and Arbitrum. The DEX currently   lets users enter trades with leverage of up to 
50x on BTC, ETH, or ARB and charges a 0.1% fee. Its liquidity model is similar to GMX’s 
except that it separates its liquidity   pools into tranches depending on 
the level of risk to the traders. LLP tokens, akin to GMX’s GLP tokens, are given 
to users who provide liquidity to the platform,   which grants holders 45% of 
the protocol fee revenue. Unlike GMX however, Level uses a dual-token 
model to separate utility and governance   functions within the protocol. LVL is the 
utility token which can be staked to earn   platform revenue and also earn LGO, the governance 
token, which can be used to vote in the Level DAO. Last but not least, we have Perpetual 
Protocol, a DEX on Optimism that allows   traders to leverage their positions up to 10x 
and charges a 0.1% fee on trades. Perpetual   Protocol introduces its own version of the AMM 
known as the virtual automated market maker. It's virtual in that unlike traditional AMMs 
used by Uniswap and Balancer which depend on   users depositing assets into liquidity pools, no 
real assets are stored on Perpetual Protocol’s   vAMM which is designed primarily for price 
discovery and not direct asset exchange. Instead,   assets are stored in a smart contract vault which 
then acts as the collateral backing the vAMM. Perpetual protocol has established 
measures including an insurance fund   to manage the risks associated with 
traders being unable to cover their   leveraged trades. The trading fees within 
the protocol are currently distributed,   with 20% allocated to the insurance 
fund and 80% going to market makers. The protocol also incentivizes user participation 
via its native token PERP. By locking their PERP,   users can become eligible for weekly USDC rewards.  There you have it, those were some of the 
most popular Perpetual DEXs currently in the   market. Be sure to check out this video

t9NLv6sr9Cw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9NLv6sr9Cw,"today we're delving into a blockchain project that's been Making Waves the open network you might already be familiar with telegram messenger but did you know that they have their very own layer one blockchain let's kick things off with a bit of History it all began when the telegram messenger team set out to find blockchain solutions that they could easily integrate into the messaging platform and support their user base when they couldn't find one that fit the bill they decided to create their own the team by Brothers Nikolai and pav durov first unveiled the telegram open network ton and its cryptocurrency Graham back in 2018 it's launch gained a lot of attention and raised a very impressive 1.7 billion in a token sale this made it one of the most successful cryptocurrency icos in history so with all this support and funding the telegram team got to work on building this new layer one blockchain but just as ton was on the brink of completion the SEC stepped in with legal action accusing telegram of an unregistered Securities offering illegal battle ensued but in 2020 Pavo announced telegram's exit from the project after a hefty 18.5 million settlement with the SEC the team issued refunds to investors and stopped development of ton and support of its test net often referred to as testnet 2 at that time Ton's code was open- source and widely accessible on GitHub which meant that anyone could contribute deciding that the project just had too much potential to waste a small team of developers led by Anatolia makov a software developer and Carol emilano a programmer with a PhD in physics and Mathematics stepped in and continued Ton's development both developers are still part of the ton Foundation team and handle core development while the current network is completely independent from Telegram in 2021 pav expressed his happiness that the project would continue and wish the new team success fast forward to 2021 and the telegram open network got a small makeover the original test net 2 by the telegram team became main net the new ton team was rebranded to ton foundation and the whole project was renamed to the open network an effort to keep its name as ton let's dive into how this blockchain works ton uses a combination of a proof of State consensus mechanism sharding and a virtual machine to ensure that it is fast flexible and coste effective because of this ton claims it can support millions of users and process millions of transactions per second at the time of this video the highest record is from 2021 when it processed 55,000 transactions per second sharding a newer approach to scalability splits the network into interconnected pieces that still run independently allowing multiple transactions to run in parallel ton also implements Dynamic sharding which means the network is able to split or merge these pieces depending on the Network's load and let's not forget tons virtual machine which is bringing some new Concepts to the table take for example that tons fee model charges the contract developer instead of users to fund operations each smart contract holds a ton token balance which it uses to pay for its own resource cost another example is the asynchronous architecture that the ton Network uses to process multiple transactions independently from each other so what is ton doing differently that sets it apart from the other L1 blockchain Solutions well at the top of the list is the Network's ability to connect with telegram's large user base in 2022 the application had over 700 million monthly active users and projects to have over 1 billion by the end of 2023 since day one part of the white paper was seamlessly bridging blockchain Technologies and distributed services to the everyday user one key step in this is the integration of the self- custodial ton based crypto wallet to the platform their users can now send receive buy and swap ton coin directly within telegram following the announcement at the token 2049 event in Singapore this year the price of ton increased by nearly 7% and continued to climb up to 43% over the next few days however at the time of shooting it has returned a fair bit of its gains but that's just the tip of the iceberg Ton's ecosystem also boasts a lineup of Game Changers including ton storage for a decentralized file storage ton proxy to safeguard your IP and ton DNS to rename your ton wallet address to human readable names but it doesn't end there you can also use ton payments for seamless transactions and ton bridge to connect with different blockchain networks and just like that crypto would become that much more accessible to the masses through a simple messaging platform that is telegram telegram's ambitious plans seem to mimic we chats and many have taken notice after all we chat with well over 1 billion monthly active users earned the title of the first super app when it seamlessly integrated instant messaging with a digital wallet and then further expanded their list of available services to include games live streams Ecommerce and more if that's the case well then ton and telegram have quite the journey ahead of them now let's talk about ton coin or ton which is the native and utility token of ton it's used for transaction fees staking and gas payments ton is also a dow meaning users who hold ton can vote on any proposals ton coin has a maximum supply of 5 billion ton and at the time of this video 3.4 billion ton are in circulation ton is also used to pay for ton DNS and ton storage but ton proxy is currently not yet available decentralized applications on the network are also integrating ton as their base currency the ton Foundation has also been actively working on growing the blockchain according to tun's own Q2 2023 developer report the network has grown in developer activity with a 6.56% increase from q1 this year on top of that a variety of programs and challenges have been running to engage with the community the Network's road map also has a few items outlined for the rest of 2023 such as the introduction of other cryptocurrencies within the ton ecosystem and Building Bridges with ethereum binance coin and Bitcoin with Advanced scalability Solutions rapid transaction processing and enhanced cross-chain communication the open network is uniquely positioned to many opportunities but just like telegram Bots such convenience usually comes with a trade-off the tons space wallet for instance also abstracts away the need for users to store their private Keys during wallet creation which raises some eyebrows on the term self custodial wallet the ease of access to crypto also open opens the flood gate to the common masses and yes this could mean a more seamless experience when it comes to sending receiving and managing crypto assets but it also means increased vulnerability to potential scams especially for the everyday user with minimal crypto knowledge well at the end of the day it's important for users to understand how these applications work and the security custodial implications behind them so there you have it our Whirlwind tour of the open network are you excited to see what lies ahead for this layer one and potential super app well let us know in the comments below also if you're interested in

VsBN-tyYWcQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsBN-tyYWcQ,"it might seem for some that the purpose of crypto is to do away with banks completely but the reality is that they still serve as an essential Fiat on and offr for a vast majority of crypto holders and Traders traditional brick and mortar Banks may be slow with crypto adoption but many digital only Neo banks have rushed to fill this Gap and for this reason many users have turned to these online banks for crypto transactions and services so let's take a look at the top crypto-friendly digital Banks currently available depending on where

fund transfers to regulated crypto exchanges moving on we have wrex a mobile pay platform based in London and founded in 2014 which now has over 5 million users YX is probably the most crypto Centric payment platform in our list but isn't technically a bank and so doesn't benefit from stateb Deposit Insurance wrix markets themselves as a web3 money app so it's no surprise that they offer a variety of crypto related products and services though its white paper last updated a a year ago does state that wrex will focus on building products that integrate both defy and trafi elements currently WX

TaQyT-kvdFw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaQyT-kvdFw,"can you believe it almost 2 years have passed since the 2021 Bitcoin bull market for many it can feel like the bullish momentum may never return however if you remain convicted in crypto and anticipate another bull market bull market B market you name the market I'm there you'll probably be interested in spotting a bull market while it's still early so in today's video we'll delve into a crucial indicator the Bitcoin bull market support band so stay tuned to find out how this tool may help your decision-making when it comes to investing in Bitcoin if you're unfamiliar with the world of crypto or financial markets in general you might be wondering what is a bull market or a bare Market a bull market signifies a period when investor confidence is high leading to prolonged asset price increases then of course in contrast a bare Market emerges when investors lose Faith causing asset prices to decline line over an extended period however it's essential to note that short-term Corrections can emerge during bull markets just as bare markets can experience relief rallies these temporary price fluctuations don't necessarily indicate a complete Market reversal for a tangible example let's go back to bitcoin's price performance during the 2020 to 2021 bull market the coid pandemic announcement in March of 2020 resulted in bitcoin's value plummeting by over 63% within just a month however it subsequently embarked on an impressive 607 day Rally surging, 1600% from $3,900 to $69,000 in hindsight it is very apparent to anyone that Bitcoin has had a bull market here in practice however it's actually extremely difficult if not imposs to predict a bull or bare Market could anyone have truly predicted a bull market in 2020 amidst a global pandemic which significantly disrupted our normal way of life setting aside external influences and focusing solely on the Bitcoin price chart those familiar with technical analysis may have found an early confirmation of the bull market in this specific weekly candle from October 2020 this candle marked the moment when bitcoin's price broke out of a 2-year long trading range that had persisted throughout the bare Market following the 2018 crash indicating a significant shift in Market momentum towards the upside although this analysis seems straightforward it actually requires a good understanding of price action to pull off on your own but what if there's an easier approach to navigating the Bitcoin Market Cycles well like I said before enter the bull market support band the bull market support band is an indicator that can help you decide whether Bitcoin is in a bull market or a bare Market this this indicator has a 20we simple moving average and a 21 we exponential moving average to get this indicator let's hop on to trading View and start using it on a Bitcoin chart so first go to tradingview.com and there you see a lovely picture of free solo rock climbing Legend Alex Honnold on this page select btcusd and it will bring you to a bitcoin price chart from the crypto exchange bitstamp as bitstamp is one of the longest standing exchanges for Bitcoin it's a great starting point to analyze bitcoin's historical price action which goes as far back to 2011 now let's place the bull market support band on this chart on the toolbar above the chart select indicators and a popup will appear type bull market support band into the search and it will show you some scripts written by the trading View Community we will use the script created by Lego szac you'll be prompted to create a free account so go ahead and do that if you signed into trading view already you can add this this script to your favorit so that you can access it easily in the future and now we have the bull market support band on our price chart so let's switch to the weekly time frame the first thing you might notice here is that Bitcoin has been mostly trading under the bull market support band for nearly the entirety of 2022 since the initial November 2021 selloff that sent bitcoin price below the bull market support band the price received three rejections whenever it Revisited the bmsb making new lows then when 2023 came about price finally broke above the bmsb it then bounced off of it twice producing the relief rally that we've witnessed for the better half of 2023 before closing back below it on August 3rd so from this we can observe two things when the price of Bitcoin is above the bmsb it tends to bounce off of it as the bmsb acts as a support when the price of Bitcoin is below the bmsb it tends to get rejected at the bmsb as it acts as a resistance when the market is bearish you could even call the bmsb a bare Market resistance band if you've paid close attention to the bmsb you might notice a secondary observation the crossover of the 20we SMA and the 21 we EMA when the market momentum is turning the moving averages tend to cross over using the default settings the 20we SMA is r and the 21 we EMA is green you will notice that when the green EMA is above the red SMA the market is on an uptrend when the market is ranging however crossovers are not reliable as it tends to produce false signals for example the bmsb produced four crossovers during the 2018 bare Market when price was consolidating in a range and eventually sold off therefore the primary way to use the bull market support band is to use the position of price relative to the band the market is bearish when price is under the bmsb and bullish when price is above the bmsb bounces off of the bmsb are potentially good entry points during an uptrend whereas rejection off of the bmsb tends to signal for caution during a downtrend however just like any other analysis tool it has its limitations as no single tool can provide you a perfect system to predict the market so if you're interested in using the bull market support band it is highly recommended that you pair it with another analysis tool now that you've learned about the bull market support band and how it helps to visualize Bitcoin Bull and bare markets feel free to hop on to trading view yourself to start doing your own analysis so although it's best paired with Bitcoin or major alts like eth or total crypto market cap the indicator also works with equities like the SNP 5

digital tokens while underlying assets and transactions take place in the physical world some examples of other real world assets that can be tokenized range from physical assets like artwork stocks cars gold and collectibles to intangible assets including equity equities carbon credits patents and bonds the tokenization process involves converting the ownership rights of a realworld asset into blockchain tokens this is done by utilizing distributed Ledger technology to track assets and their real world attributes such as their performance and valuation which are derived from sources outside the blockchain similar to other crypto tokens real world asset tokens can be programmed to include features like lockup periods and specific requirements for investors so why are real world assets seen as a revolutionary concept well imagine this by putting things like property or valuable items on the blockchain we open up a whole new world of possibilities especially for people who want to invest through Define for instance a super expensive property could be split into tiny Parts making it affordable for smaller investors to join in and invest another Advantage lies in liquidity investors can buy sell and trade tokens instantly on the blockchain giving them access to what normally are a liquid assets on top of that these tokens aren't Bound by where you live whether you're in one corner of the world or another as long as you have internet access you can invest so let's explore some real examples have you ever felt like property prices are soaring way past your reach well there are now new projects that let you invest in rental properties and receive rental income lofty promises instant access to Great property deals Across America without the hassle of down payments connections or any of the headaches that come with being a landlord investors will receive daily rent payouts and collect property appreciation when Cashing Out investors can use usdc or Alo to fund orders similarly to lofty home base is also a big advocate for letting anyone invest in real estate with as little as $100 investors can purchase fractional shares of properties and receive monthly rental income Homebase is also complying with security regulations and transactions are in usdc if you're interested in exploring capital and debt markets then we have two platforms to share with you that are digitizing realworld credit Investments cuge facilitates decentralized financing of liquid Capital markets by harnessing the power of blockchain Technology the protocol is bringing the entire stru red credit Market on chain to provide defi users with a stable source of collateralized yield centrifuge uses the CFG token Maple is another protocol that provides an Innovative protocol for credit Specialists to establish onchain lending businesses this integration of Industry standard compliance and smart contracts results in a versatile platform for financial institutions pool delegates and companies alike npl is the governance token of the maple protocol on the other hand commod markets can be another interesting opportunity for those looking to invest in gold without the hassle of actually keeping the physical gold Pax gold offers investors a way to own investment grade physical gold on the blockchain each pxg token is backed by one fine troy ounce of gold that is stored in lbma vaults in London next we've got Ando a project that has managed to tokenize US Treasury Bonds on chain these tokenized US Treasury bonds called o USG can be used as collateral on platforms like flux Finance allowing their holders to unlock more liquidity that can be used for leverage or deployed elsewhere to farm and earn more yield all of these are using the power of tokenization to introduce a variety of products that mirror cash equivalents but we're only going to cover their most recent one the Ando Us doll yield token or usdy it is a tokenized token which takes Innovation from stable coins and is secured by short-term us treasuries and Bank deposits but what obstacles do we face when we want to bring real world things onto the blockchain well there's a bunch of them from navigating the landscape of legal and Regulatory Compliance to addressing valuation and auditing intricacies the complexity of these obstacles vary sure the borderless nature of tokenized real estate assets is a practical and coste effective way to invest but authorities have yet to establish a standard set of laws on these onchain ownerships especially when different jurisdictions and legal Frameworks are involved we must also tackle questions on governance and Trust all while keeping a watchful eye on scalability concerns fixing these issues is a big task that needs a lot of teamwork token issuers service providers regulatory Watchdogs and those to invest everyone needs to work together to make it happen so by overcoming these challenges we can create a new an amazing way of handling things like never before so as we wrap up remember the future of rwas in the crypto space is an exciting space and as technology continues to evolve we can expect a new era where more and more assets will become tokens the integration of real world assets into the crypto space is a transformative leap to towards a more inclusive and accessible Financial landscape from investing in art to owning shares of a company or even a fraction of a skyscraper the opportunities are expanding like never before so keep your sight set on this transformative journey ahead because the world of real world Assets in crypto is brimming with possibilities what do you think will be the most interesting real world asset to tokenize well let us know in the comments below and if you're

-eF5WkZLfno,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eF5WkZLfno,how much value do you put on friendship and how much do your friends value you would you sell off a friendship of yours for a good price well all of these are put to the test on this new raging phenomenon called front Tech so what is it how does it work and most importantly is it your friend or Foe stay tuned as we learn more about this latest crypto craze the idea of a decentralized social app isn't new we've seen many iterations of the next web3 Facebook or Twitter but friendtech has been by far the most successful one to date so what is it well in short friendtech is a web 3 social app built on the base Network almost 300 000 users 309 million of trading volume friend Tech was so popular that it pretty much single-handedly helped base surpass ethereum arbitrim and optimism in average transactions per second shortly after it launched even more impressively frenttech is also now one of the most profitable protocols consistently edging out well-known powerhouses like uniswap maker Dao and even the Bitcoin Network all of these in just a couple of months since its release on August 10th funnily enough the viral app that's captured the entire crypto Space by storm actually didn't start out as friend Tech the social app is founded by a two-person team team racer and shrimp Racer's first foray into decentralized social media was actually tweet doubt whose AG nfts granted access to posting from a shared Twitter account the project went viral before it was eventually shut down not long after racer returned with another decentralized social platform alongside co-founder shrimp the two created steel cam a web 3 social platform that lets you mint images as nfts these aren't normal images however you can't see what they are before you buy them and they can also disappear at any moment that's because anyone can buy them off of you whenever they like without your consent that is unless of course you're willing to pay an even higher price to win them back but in May the developers decided to Rebrand steel cam to friendtech and well the rest is history the premise of friend Tech is simple the app itself lets you buy and sell shares oh sorry I mean keys of your friends or any other users on friendtech the more keys purchased the more exponentially expensive these Keys become every Buy sell transaction incurs a 10 fee half of which goes to the person you are buying from or selling to and the other half goes to the platform as a key owner you gain special access to a chat room with your friend where you'll be able to send messages to one another or even enjoy special gated contents shared by the Creator does that sound familiar only fans but why all the hype well one simple reason for its popularity may be the likely possibility of an airdrop in the future as suggested by the app itself which states that points are airdropped every Friday and will have future uses in friend Tech several popular names are already on friendtech including popular CT Personnel like H Saka Kobe Sisyphus prank C and more the friend Tech fever has even spread beyond the crypto Circle to NBA sensation Grayson Allen FaZe Banks and a slew of um other celebrities that saw their keys getting snatched up by their fans even VCS like Paradigm decided to hop onto the friend Tech Train wow how do I start to start you'll first need a special invite code which you can easily grab from your friends or any of the influencers from crypto Twitter or sorry sorry X then simply follow the instructions to create an account and connect to X like unibot friendtech will automatically create a wallet for you which you'll need to deposit a minimum of 0.01 each from the ethereum or base Network for privacy it's advisable to use a burner wallet or sex to deposit funds into the platform otherwise it may be all too easy for your main wallet address to be docks via its link to your X account once that's done you'll be able to start buying and trading your friends to rack up those airdrop points you'll need to stay active on the app by buying and selling keys or sharing your personal invite codes to others it's not all sunshine and roses for friendtech though many question the staying power of friend Tech not least due to the fact that an airdrop has been blatantly teased since the app's launch while it's hard to say whether there's going to be a token airdrop for sure consensus on CT seems to point towards this on top of that the sustainability of the platform is questionable given that the keys of top profiles on the platform can range from 0.1 each to over seven each so this certainly begs the question if all this activity is simply propped up by board whales all pining for a lucrative airdrop the incentive model of front Tech which gives five percent of Revenue to the owners of traded profiles also naturally encourages popular public figures to jump on the bandwagon for easy money as their keys will likely be traded by many even if no real extra value is being provided through the use of the friend Tech platform to date the platform has already earned its users 15 million in fees with top profiles taking hundreds of thousands of dollars each while activity on friendtech has been volatile as showcased by its volume and users the fact is that it's still one of the most most active daps today well at least at the time when this video was made also several parties have cited privacy concerns you're in finance contributor banteg published a repository of friend Tech user details using publicly available data showing how easy it is to docs users based on the link between their X profiles and wallet address since the wallet is automatically created for you when you sign up there are also questions as to how and where the private keys are stored remember the ethos of crypto not your keys not your wallet and while there are certain safeguards you can employ to minimize these issues the fact is that these privacy concerns do exist and the question is how much are you willing to sacrifice in the name of friendship well friendtech is an example of how anything that can be tokenized will be tokenized it's an Innovative attempt at tokenizing attention and influence reminiscent of web 2 platforms like only fans and patreon regard regardless concerns have been raised and it certainly doesn't hurt to play it safe with extra precautions and remember always always dyor if you want to learn more about decentralized social media well then

lIc8BMjhDMc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIc8BMjhDMc,Adam Smith the father of modern economics one set that specialization will lead to growth this philosophy is commonly seen in d52 you have uniswap which specializes in facilitating trades Ave a money market that focuses on lending and borrowing uscc and usdt the dollar pegged stable coins that form the foundation of this crypto economy but what if instead of specializing in just one category you unite all of these defy Services Under One Umbrella a single combined synergistic stack capable of functioning as an independent ecosystem well introducing frax Finance frax Finance which started in May 2019 was formerly called decentral bank and was founded by Sam kasmian Travis Moore and Jason Juan since its Inception it's undergone three rounds of funding boasting prominent VCS such as crypto.com capital asensive assets infinite Capital Flex capital and more among its backers what initially started out as only a fractional algorithmic stable coin protocol has blossomed into a full-fledged ecosystem spanning multiple defy verticals its co-founder Sam kasmian believes that d5's core Services fall into three categories stable points liquidity systems such as dexes or even liquid staking platforms that help unlock liquidity for staked assets and lending markets instead of specializing in just one of them and Outsourcing the rest frax strives to break this mold by offering the D5 Pi of this Holy Trinity before it's launched in 2020 stable coins that existed were either collateral backed like usdt or fully algorithmic-like ESD DSD collateralized stable coins are not Capital efficient and there were doubts about the resilience of an algorithmic stable and many also failed and lost their Peg eventually so enter frax Finance bringing together The Best of Both Worlds in the first ever fractional algorithmic stable coin frax in its first version Frac civilization mechanism relies on two assets usdc and the governance token of frax Finance fxs for example at 85 collateral ratio to Mint 1 Franc the user would need to supply 85 cents of uscc and 15 cents of fxs this fxs would then be burnt the idea was simple if the market price of frax went above one dollar people could Min fracts with one dollar worth of collateral and sell it for more than a dollar making a profit if the market price of racks went below a dollar arbitrators could buy fracks for less than a dollar and redeem it for a dollars worth of collateral also making a profit in V2 frax implemented automatic market operations or Amos with Amos prax is able to generate additional Revenue through various external protocols for instance instead of letting its hundreds of millions of uscc collateral just sit there Gathering dust frax developed the lending Amo to deposit this collateral into various money markets like Ave and compound to earn interest the curve Amo which arguably has had the largest impact on frax's growth allows fracks to mince racks and pair it with usdc to provide liquidity and earn CRV rewards yield in the curve stable pool by adding and removing frax liquidity from the curve pool the protocol could also ensure that the balance of frax would be maintained to keep its dollar Peg other Amos include investor Amo and liquidity Amo covering other a M's like uniswap all these ammos help to maintain the price of racks through various monetary policies and at the same time generate Revenue that can be used for fxs BuyBacks which gets distributed to Via fxs stakers with a mature battle tested stablecoin in place Frack started to Branch out to the second and third aspect of the Holy Trinity first it was frax swap which was launched in June last year at its Court Frack swap is a permissionless automated Market maker based on the uniswab V2 model and is the first lifetime weighted amm implementation soon after this came fracked lint in September with this the protocol was able to Mint and lend out frax users who deposit collaterals such as eth or BTC all of these helped generate extra cash flow for the protocol to buy back and burn fxs or engage in other market operations to maintain the price Peg of frax just in time before the LSD boom frax also launched frax ether which is their ethereum liquid staking and stablecoin system in October last year frax's liquid staking model takes an interesting spin different from its competitors like Lido and rocketpool unlike sceath or rethrax's model comprises two tokens called frax eat and S fraxi when eth is staked through frax eat is minted to the user this eath is then staked by the protocol and used to earn staking Wards now to be clear frax eth is pegged one to one to eat and is not a yield generating acid with frax eth you generally have two options deploy frax eat elsewhere like curved pools to earn yield or deposit into the S frax Heath Vault to start earning staking yield the less Rax eth is staked the more s-rax eats stakers earn since the same amount of eth rewards is distributed to fewer Vault owners this also means that more frax eat utility and liquidity black holes benefit srax eat since yield would be higher as a result s-rax eat is able to offer outsized yield compared to its competitors at the time of making this video SRX eat yield is at 5.12 apy versus Lido's SCE at 3.8 percent to date there are a few coins under the frax ecosystem fxs the governance and utility token which started out with a Max supply of 100 million fxs can also be staked for vfxs to vote and earn a portion of protocol Revenue recently oroboro's Capital also put up a proposal to initiate an aggressive Buy-Back and burn strategy when fxs dips below five dollars which has also earned praise and approval from Sam himself if passed an artificial price floor will be established for fxs then we have frax the partial algorithmic USC stablecoin FBI the second stablecoin pegged to the U.S consumer price index frax Ethan sfax eat the ethereum stablecoin and liquid staking derivative tokens so then what's next for frax well first there's confirmation that frax will become fully collateralized sometime down the road and then frax V3 is also in the works with Sam teasing its direction on how it'll be closely tied into real world assets a recent proposal has also been put up to partner with a U.S corporation finrest PBC as a step towards bringing Trad Phi assets on chain meanwhile frax chain a hybrid optimistic ZK ethereum L2 roll-up is also in plans for launch at the end of this year frax chains governance will be led by fxs holders and the network will use frax eat sfax eat and frax for gas expanding the utility and potentially demand for these tokens while it's clear that frax has outgrown its days as just a one-dimensional protocol into a multi-faceted ecosystem today Sam's vision of the Holy Trinity has been implemented designed to lend synergistic use cases for all of its assets fxs frax eat fracks and more to self-generate a flywheel effect as the ecosystem grows more demand is created for its assets and thus more Revenue some of questioned as to how truly decentralized a protocol is that heavily leans on arbitrary monetary policies with uscc back the most if not all of its stable coin but it seems the model continues to work for now more Protocols are tackling the Trinity with Ave and curve already launching into their own stable coin will this be the new future for defy well only time will tell if you want to learn more about stable coins well

and even made it a legal tender in El Salvador El Salvador also made headlines when the local Energy company La Geo harnessed the country's geothermal energy to mine Bitcoin while it showcases the country's support towards Bitcoin mining with renewable energy concerns have been raised about the strain on the electrical grid as the country is already importing a significant portion of its electricity despite the controversy it didn't deter bukele from planning a Bitcoin City funded by Bitcoin backed bonds this bet seems to have paid off as these bonds pumped 62 percent following the recent news on spot Bitcoin ETFs next on the list is Berlin Germany a long-standing hub for D5 since hosting the first ever ethereum developer Meetup in 2014. the city's crypto scene is vibrant and

9AWJ08m23u8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AWJ08m23u8,base a layer 2 blockchain by coinbase has been the darling of crypto lately frequently finding itself in the headline sings the glamour of coinbase and its wealth of new projects as well as some less Savory scandals but most importantly did you know that base was actually built a top of the optimism stack by well optimism so today we take a dive into the Super chain of the crypto world and see what it has to offer first things first the history optimism was founded in 2019 by a trio of experts in blockchain and ethereum development there is Carl flourish a former ethereum Foundation researcher jinglan Wang who's played a pivotal role in creating the Project's optimistic rollup solution and Kevin hoe computer science engineer specialized in digital media design as of November 30th 2022 the team has raised a total of 178 million from VC powerhouses such as Paradigm winter mute Andre and harowitz and nent just to name a few generally generally there are two types of ethereum rollups optimistic and ZK rollups optimism was the first such layer to scaling for ethereum conducted through optimistic rollups optimism does this by rolling up transaction data from the main chain bundling them into single batches to be processed and settled on the ethereum main net after which they are returned in a highly compressed form by doing so optimism enhances scalability without compromising on security enabling faster and cheaper transactions now if you want to learn more about ethereum rollups you can find out more from our previous video right here click right there now since its highly anticipated mainnet launch in December 2021 optimism has made significant strides accomplishing numerous Milestones along the way first there was the op air drop that happened on May 31st last year in fact interest in the token ran so high that it jammed up the optimism network with this optimism officially evolved into a dow dubbed as the optimism Collective since then the project has been busy delivering a number of upgrades to the network earlier this year on June 6th optimism also successfully completed its Bedrock hard Fork its largest upgrade ever that's significantly cut transaction fees by 40% and deposit confirmation times from 10 minutes to less than a minute Bedrock also improved the proof modularity for its op stack a development software stack which enables developers to Launch their own layer 2 blockchains these proof modularity improvements to the op stack means that both validity proofs AKA ZK proofs as well as fraud proofs can be used meaning l2s building with the op stack could either be optimistic or ZK Roll-Ups themselves the Bedrock hard Fork also includes other upgrades that would turn optimism into the first layer 2 running on a multic client ecosystem this helps improve its resilience by reducing possibilities of network downtime say if there is a bug in one client's software the blockchain would be able to rely on the other users running other client softwares to keep the blockchain live other changes include improved node performance which enables execution of several transactions in a single rollup block as opposed to the one transaction per block model previously lastly there's also improved ethereum equivalents which sees certain upgrades being introduced to help optimism achieve maximum compatibility with the ethereum mothership with the Bedrock upgrade done optimism has just laid down the foundation or if you will the Bedrock for its vision of becoming a Super chain as mentioned in the beginning coinbase has already integrated the optimism scaling solution into the base blockchain by integrating optimism coinbase aims to provide a more scalable and costeffective infrastructure for developers building on the base blockchain with more chains declaring their use of the op stack instead of having a fractured ecosystem optimism aims to have a unified user experience over the next few years the idea is to make optimism and any networks built using the op stack like base increasingly feel like one seamless super chain in fact optimism recently announced a name change to the op main net to better reflect the objective of creating a super chain network of many layer 2 blockchains today several chains are already being built at top of the op stack some of the more notable efforts aside from base include op BNB a B&B chain layer 2 that's currently in its test net phase Avo by ribon Finance the first derivatives Focus L2 that lets users trade options and pers loot chain a new L2 ecosystem dedicated to loot verse the text based nft phenomenon back during the height of nft summer in 2021 dbank chain a new L2 by dbank that has been described as an asset layer for social as well as many others all of which will become a part of the op super chain op is the native currency of the op main net as an L2 Network optimism still uses eth as gas for transactions with OP only being the optimism collectives governance token op launch with a total supply of 4.3 million tokens with a 2% Perpetual inflation rate per year the token Supply allocation includes 20% to be used retroactively for public goods funding 25% for ecosystem funds 19% air drop to eligible users 17% to investors and 19% to core contributors majority of the investors and core contributors would be subject to 2-year lockup periods whereas tokens reserve for Community are vested for one year or less at the moment its valuation sits at 6.3 billion almost four times from its series B valuation of 1.65 billion according to defi Lama optimism is currently the seventh largest chain by tbll behind only the likes of ethereum Tron BSC arbitrum Avalanche and polygon recently we even saw optimism overtaking arbitrament transactions thanks to the world coin launch on the op mayet V Drome and Native deck built on the op mayet is now the largest protocol on the network with a 25% dominance in TBL super chain may be in its early days but its potential to become the outof the-box standard for launching new chains lends significant potential to optimism the optimism super chain idea can radically change the layer 2 ecosystem where rollups are not working in silos but in a shared ecosystem with this initiative optimism is effectively Outsourcing scaling and growth to countless parties so will the Super chain ever take flight while only time can tell and also it's not just ethereum that's pumping out l2s these days so learn more about Bitcoin layer

7luns0-7sHw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7luns0-7sHw,there's a common theme that ties people like Bill Gates Elon Musk Richard Branson and Mark Cuban together yes they're all massively successful figures with billions of dollars of net worth but they're also known to be some of the biggest bookworms in the world Warren Buffett for instance dedicates 80 of his day to reading and claims that the knowledge from Reading builds up over time just like compound interest and if there's anything that us folks from crypto can appreciate it's a good compounding interest so in no particular order let's jump right into the ultimate crypto reading list first up we have the Bitcoin standard by safed amus the book starts off by exploring the economics and history of hard money tracing the ancient money trail from currencies of olden days like seashells limestones cattle and metals all the way to the modern day financial instruments like government deaths and bonds before long the concept of Bitcoin

brutally dissecting and criticizing its failures and the cascading effects this has had on our politics society and economy the book offers a chilling insight into the flaws of our broken monetary system and paves the way for how Bitcoin could be the way forward as in the first book the Fiat standard is suffused with the author's passionate world view on bitcoin so for those who enjoy reading the Bitcoin standard and want to dive deeper into the rabbit hole definitely give the Fiat standard a try to the provocative title of check your financial privilege by author Alex gladstein serves as a perfect little preview into its literary Journey the basic premise of this book revolves around Financial inclusion and freedom glad scene is of the opinion that anyone born into a reserved currency

financial privilege details real life stories of Bitcoin usage across the globe from Human Rights activists opposing authoritarian regimes in Nigeria to the everyday struggles of a family from El Salvador it's a uniquely human view on the world of cryptocurrencies that could prove to be an interesting experience so the idea of magic internet money has been mocked by countless across the world I see you crypto Geeks but that hasn't stopped millions of others from becoming Believers of Bitcoin and the blockchain technology Digi little gold by Nathaniel popper is a Blow by blow account of the rise of Bitcoin told through the lens of its mysterious inventor Satoshi Nakamoto and a few other Central characters including the Winklevoss brothers and a Chinese entrepreneur if you've ever thought about money and wondered what gives it value if you've ever thought about Bitcoin and wondered how it came about and where it will go digital gold would be the book for you okay next up we have the cryptopians by Laura Shin the cryptopians lays down the historical Journey behind the formation of ethereum all the hardship and drama endured by the founding members of crypto Legends like vitalik buterin Charles hoskinson gavinwood Joe Lubin and more there are technical portions sprinkled here and there throughout but the book's main focus is centered on the human aspects of the ethereum story and how the founders now navigated the early scenes of crypto to launch the second largest coin in history so definitely pick this up if you're interested in learning all the scoop behind ethereum's Genesis story The Missing crypto Queen is an account of the biggest crypto fraud in the world the book follows the story of Dr ruja ignatova an Oxford educated self-styled crypto Queen who promised a

Ti5U040v3so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti5U040v3so,with some attention back on bitcoin due to the rise of nfts and tokens on the network we're taking a look at some projects building in the Bitcoin ecosystem one of these projects is rootstock or rsk network which will take a deeper look at in this video back in November 2015 rsk released a white paper describing their plan to add ethereum like smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain which would enable things like defy and nfts three years later in 2018 rootstock launched its main net and claims to be the most secure smart contract Network in the world before rootstock emerged in 2015 the story of its team had already begun with the development of kixcoin in 2013. kickscoin is a touring complete cryptocurrency that would later be evolved into rsk in 2015 the team officially established rsk Labs which was subsequently acquired by rootstock infrastructure framework AKA rif labs and ultimately rebranded as iov Labs so the team features members such as Sergio Damian Lerner a renowned cryptocurrency researcher and serial entrepreneur who now serves as the Chief scientist officer at iov Labs other key members include Diego Gutierrez zalivad a Pioneer and Latin American Web and blockchain development who is the chairman and co-founder at iov labs and Adrian idelman a seasoned programmer Who currently acts as the technical director of the company after the formation of rsk labs in the early days from 2014 to 2018 the team was able to secure 7.3 million over nine funding rounds among the projects notable investors were Alpha coin fund eight decimal capital and bit Fury to offer functionalities Beyond Bitcoin rsk employs sidechain technology allowing the smart contract platform to run parallel to the Bitcoin blockchain this connection is facilitated in two ways first through merged mining a method where miners can secure more than one blockchain simultaneously without the need for additional computational resources in the context of RS this means Bitcoin miners can also secure the rsk network at the same time they are mining Bitcoin as per its block Explorer rsk is currently secured by about half of bitcoin's hash rate on the rsk slide chain blocks are created more frequently approximately every 30 seconds compared to bitcoin's 10 minute generation time this rapid block creation serves to secure the execution of smart contracts on the rsk network while this process doesn't create new coins like Bitcoin mining miners do receive transaction fees from the rsk network as a reward the second crucial element in rsk's connection to the Bitcoin blockchain is through a two-way Bridge known as the pow Pig short for proof of work Peg which facilitates the transfer of Bitcoins into the rsk network imagine you as a user want to engage with a lending platform on the rsk network you would deposit Bitcoins into the pow Pig Bridge address these Bitcoins are then blocked and an equivalent number of rbtc rsk's native token are minted on the rsk network for you rbtc acts as the gas on rsk allowing you to interact with smart contracts on the network just like how eth functions within the ethereum network note though that the conversion requires 100 Bitcoin block confirmations before finality which is approximately 17 hours a very long time a very long time when you decide to revert your rbtc back to bitcoin the process is simply reversed where you send rbtc to the bridge rbtc is locked on the rsk network and the corresponding Bitcoins are unlocked from the designated Bitcoin address and returned to your Bitcoin wallet as rbtc is issued on a one-to-one basis with locked BTC sent to the pow peg this imposes a cap on the the total supply of rbtc aligning it with bitcoin's maximum supply of 21 million currently there are about 3 500 rbtc issued according to the rsk block Explorer to top it off the smart contracts on the network are run by the rsk virtual machine rvm which is essentially a modified Fork of the widely used ethereum virtual machine evm and so is compatible with it this reduces the barrier of entry for developers as it means that smart contracts can be written and executed on rsk in the same way they are on ethereum these key technological features enable the rsk network to combine the robust security of bitcoin's infrastructure and the advanced smart contract capabilities of ethereum as for the ecosystem surrounding rsk according to rootstock's website there are 47 projects including wallets crypto exchanges lending platforms and bridges while the website cites a tvl of 300 million we're not sure if this is the latest figure and maybe including the BTC that is locked in its pow Peg Bridge defy llama tracks nine D5 protocols on rsk and reports a tvl of 90 million with essentially all of it being held in two protocols money on chain and Sovereign iov Labs has also been trying to accelerate rootstock's growth as they announced recently in May this year a 2.5 million grants program as well as a hackathon aimed at enhancing the development and Adoption of the network earlier this year in February rootstock also launched a product known as the rif flyover which is designed to enhance the pow Peg protocol by significantly reducing the long wait time for transactions between BTC and rbtc to a couple of minutes they also disclosed ongoing work on rif rollup formerly known as rif aggregation which is a zero knowledge layer 2 scaling solution this layer 2 will be built on top of the rootstock blockchain to enhance transaction throughput and reduce costs while remaining integrated with the Bitcoin ecosystem through rsk to wrap up it's clear that projects like rsk are trying to push the boundaries of what is achievable with the Bitcoin Network however it's worth noting that rootstock is not the only player in this field and its ux can be comparatively poorer than other projects for instance its bridging mechanism which can incur long wait times and high fees which may slow its adoption another significant project making strides in this area is Stacks which you can

L6WKWz8dlfU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6WKWz8dlfU,the last crypto Bull Run started in Earnest in late 2020 which ended with Bitcoin price doubling around its all-time high at 69k just shy of the 70k Mark if you've been around in space long enough you should be familiar with the four-year Cycle Theory which is based on the fact that all prior Market Cycles have roughly taken four years to play out when measured from the bottom of the previous cycle to the bottom of the next if history is any indication this could mean that the markets may have bottom twin FDX collapsed and started it slow sometimes painful recovery but truth is there's no Surefire way to anticipate the next Bull markets a crypto Bull Run could be on the horizon or it could be super far away still regardless if you're like us you don't want to be caught unprepared an ape your life savings away with fomo as your compass so here are seven essential tips that you should know to get ready for the next Bull Run tip number one educate yourself the first step to preparing for a bull run is to gain a solid understanding of crypto and blockchain take the time to research and read up on different projects explore white papers books follow the industry news just as an example the biggest star of defy in 2023 has been liquid staking or LSD many of those well-versed with the intricacies and nuances of LSD understood and correctly predicted that lsd5 would be the next natural beta play so educating yourself about the fundamentals will help you build up that knowledge to make better informed decisions identify future catalysts and more now that you have the fundamentals down it's important to stay informed about the market what's the temperature of narratives like real world assets LSD and meme coins what are the Optics of crypto regulations these days how will these affect the broader crypto Market think about it this way you want to get a read on the soil before growing anything as a farmer what's the acidity level how is the rainfall and climate like in the area what sort of plants can you grow on it so the same goes for crypto investment you need to stock and keep yourself informed of the market before going in for the kill for many crypto Twitter is the place to be for this but you can also read news and join other communities on Discord Telegram and many more doing this can potentially help you get in on new upcoming Trends in catalysts before they blow up before diving right in you need to First determine your investment objectives and risk tolerance are you looking for short-term swings or long-term opportunities can you afford to lose this setting clear goals will affect your portfolio decision helping you to decide whether an ultra high risk meme coin fits into your plan or a more relative risk-free approach in staking and accumulating eth or DCA into Bitcoin is more appropriate clear goals are important in keeping you focused and avoid being swayed by market hype during a bull run one of the golden rules of investing is to never invest more than you can afford to lose setting a budget helps you manage risk and ensures that you don't go overboard In the Heat of the Moment take all my money it also helps you track your progress easier remember the potential rewards in the crypto Market are high but so are the risks by setting a budget you establish a clear boundary for your Investments preventing emotional decisions at the risk of sounding like a broken record at this point another crucial tip is to always always dyor yes that crypto Messiah you've been following just share this amazing opportunity for a low-cap gem but no matter what it is and who it's from before investing in any coin you need to examine the project from top to bottom understand the project its team and the problem it aims to solve does it have any product Market fit what is its emission schedule like dive into technical analysis 2 studying charts Trends and historical data it's all about understanding the risks before you jump in now that said we're all human and when bullish times arrive our decisions may be as irrational as the markets themselves meme coins for example do not have fundamentals but you may be tempted to hop aboard the train which is also where the budgeting and risk management we mentioned earlier comes into play don't bet the farm on a short-term gamble last but not least remember to manage your emotions and psyche the crypto Market can be highly volatile which can translate to emotional highs and lows too it's crucial to stay level-headed and avoid making impulsive decisions based on emotions set realistic expectations and then stick to your investment strategy now tweak or adjust your strategy within reason if needed but avoid chasing fomo or getting influenced by market height practice patience discipline and a long-term mindset by keeping your emotions in check you can make rational decisions and navigate the market with a clear focus on your investment goals by following these rules you'll be well equipped to navigate the market with confidence as always stay informed stay vigilant and stay curious if you'd like to learn more about researching like a pro then check out our previous video right here [Music] thank you,Youtube video,6 BEST Tips to Prepare For The Next Crypto Bull

gTT-4DzUf8c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTT-4DzUf8c,there's an exciting new ethereum layer 2 solution called Linea developed by consensus the company behind well-known web3 tools like metamask infuria and truffle linea's mainnet was launched last month after a successful testnet phase that began in March which saw active participation from over 5.5 million unique wallets also consensus has established the Linea ecosystem investment Alliance comprising over 30 BC firms to back developers looking to build on linear's ecosystem alright let's Dive Right In so what is lamia well Linea is an ethereum equivalent zkevm layer 2 roll-up developed by consensus as we all know by now ethereum faces scaling challenges which has brought about the mushrooming of layer twos which are currently dominated by either optimistic relapse like arbitrum and optimism and increasingly ZK Roll-Ups like ZK sync Stark net and now Linea just to refresh your memory optimistic Roll-Ups assume transactions are valid unless proven false within a specific time frame before posting transactions on the main net this could cause delays and withdrawals back to the main net take up to a week to finalize however they are also the most widely used today due to their relative ease of implementation zero knowledge Roll-Ups on the other hand use zero knowledge proofs which is a method of using complex math and cryptography to validate each transaction this theoretically makes them able to provide faster confirmations because all transactions are proven valid using zero knowledge proofs and with the highest security guarantees removing the need to wait for a dispute window to pass the challenge however lies in generating improving the zero knowledge proofs as they are complex and requires substantial computational power to create as we can see from starknet's current performance it is still rather slow despite its supposed scalability benefits to overcome this Linea utilizes lattice based cryptography to create zero knowledge proofs for each transaction on its Network lattice based encryption demands less computational power computes faster and is easier to implement compared to other encryption systems this efficiency results in cheaper and faster transactions to connect with ethereum's main net Linea employs its canonical message service using post Bots to exchange data between between the two networks these post Bots listen for calls on Smart contracts and relate information to the other network in summary linea's layer 2 approach involves using zero knowledge proofs powered by lattice based cryptography to validate transactions on its Network it then bundles these validated transactions using roll-up technology and submits them to ethereum through the canonical message service another challenge faced by zero knowledge Roll-Ups is evm compatibility this is due to the complexity and inflexibility of ZK Roll-Ups making it harder to implement smart contracts compared to optimistic rollups however Linea claims to have a developer ready and evm equivalent ZK evm being evm equivalent means more than just being compatible with ethereum it ensures that smart contract code executes in the same way as it does on ethereum to illustrate this distinction other ZK Roll-Ups like ZK sync 2.0 offer only language level compatibility developers write solidity code ethereum smart contract language which then gets transpiled into a different language when executed in fact starknet another ZK rollup does not offer evm compatibility which forces developers to write smart contract code in a different language in contrast Linea is byte code evm compatible enabling seamless deployment of applications from ethereum to Linea without any code modifications polygon ZK evm also claims to have the same capability this bytecode evm compatibility could make Linea an appealing choice for developers seeking easy integration with the ethereum ecosystem according to lineus docs it takes about 20 minutes to bridge East from ethereum to Linea and at least eight hours to bridge from linear back to ethereum this however is still much quicker than optimistic Roll-Ups where users have to wait at least a week to receive Bridge tokens on mainnet as of now Linea does not have a token and consensus has stated that they have no immediate plans for a token thus eth is used on the network for gas fees however Linea initiated a campaign called Linea Voyage in May lasting for two months and the goal was to incentivize participants to stress test its test net resulting in an impressive 47 million transactions during that period now that Linea has entered its mainnet phase participants who completed on-chain challenges provided by Linea have received up to five nfts as a commemoration of the successful test net despite being a relatively new layer 2 solution Linea already boasts an impressive ecosystem directory on its website listing 64 projects spanning various sectors including defy gaming nfts and more moreover the network is set to welcome well-known projects like Ave sushi up and pancake swap in the near future users can seamlessly engage with the Linea ecosystem using the metamask wallet alternatively Linea also supports a few other wallets like Fox wallet Crystal naybox and desig as seen on D5 llama Linnaeus 9 defy dapps currently hold approximately 14 million in total value locked with lineabank a non-custodial lending protocol supporting eth borrowing and lending accounting for about half of this tvl moving forward consensus's plans to decentralize lineage Network through several phases currently Linea is in Phase zero where it introduces its evm equivalent zkevm and establishes a security Council to oversee the network and protect users from potential risks from using a new protocol in Phase One Linea will make its software stack open source and ensure that its ZK evm can cover all evm functions moving to phase 2 Linea aims to expand and its Security Council to decentralize decision making and avoid bias additionally it will enable censorship resistant withdrawals to enhance user roll-up operators from blocking transactions phase 3 addresses the centralization challenge posed by zero knowledge Roll-Ups as Linea plans to decentralize its operators and governance this step will lead to a more trustless and community-centric platform lastly in phase four Linea will Implement a multi-prover roll-up system providing multiple methods to prove validity furthermore it will balance governance power to prevent potential governance abuse by progressing through these phases Linea will achieve its vision of becoming a fully decentralized and robust layer 2 solution since linea's mainnet launched last month the network has seen over 500 000 wallet addresses participating in transactions although linea's activity may be lower than other more established zika Roll-Ups currently it shows most promising potential for growth as the ecosystem continues to develop and mature so what are your thoughts on Linea do you believe it has the potential to become the next popular layer 2 solution well in case you need a recap on layer zeros layer ones layer twos you can check out our previous videos on those here foreign [Music],Youtube video,Linea: Consensys's LATEST ZK Layer 2 to

mZ-7lUKdH0U,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ-7lUKdH0U,basis public mainnet has launched about a month ago and from the meme coins rug pulls socialapp friend.tech and more it has certainly managed to capture a lot of attention from crypto veterans and normies alike in this video we'll cover all you need to know about base and how you can get started exploring it bass is an ethereum layer 2 incubated by none other than coinbase the second largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange which sits only behind binance base says testnet was launched in late February this year and its mainnet launched to the public on August 9th it uses optimistic roll-up technology that increases the scalability of ethereum by bundling multiple transactions on its Network and settling them as one on the ethereum mainnet we've talked lengths about layer twos and how they work in previous videos so if you need to feel free to check those out after you're done with this one specifically though its rollup technology is built with the op stack which is an open source framework developed by op Labs the team behind optimism in fact coinbase is also actively involved in the development of the op stack having joined opylaps as the second core developer team for it the op stack serves as the building block to enable optimism's vision of the super chain which is now shared by many other projects this super chain would in theory enable multiple l2s building with the op stack to eventually operate with one another seamlessly base is also evm equivalent so all ethereum code tools and infrastructure works out of the box as it's built on the op stack its technology and performance may not be very different from optimism or some of the other l2s popping up however a couple of differentiating features are owed to the fact that it is incubated by coinbase for instance it has more integration with the coinbase wallet and app making it more accessible to beginners and existing coinbase users approximately 100 million of them it will also likely have no issues obtaining funding for further development since bridging in was enabled unique users and transaction count have skyrocketed to get started on base you'll need metamask coinbase wallet or any other compatible browser wallet then go to chainlist.org to add the base Network to your wallet you can transfer your assets from the East Main net to base using their official Bridge which we'll Link in the description below or a faster and cheaper option could be via bridging from other l2s with third-party Bridges like Orbiter or hop after funding your base wallet feel free to check out the wide variety of dapps on the network according to its ecosystem page there are currently 139 projects building on base spanning D5 nfts infrastructure and more with many probably yet to be included at the time of shooting new projects such as rcam and synthetics have been announcing their launch on the network or had governance proposals to deploy on base past ux has been pretty good from our own testing gas fees are extremely low almost free and transactions are fast as you'd expect tvl on base has climbed rapidly and currently stands at 194 million locked in at about 60 D5 protocols with the top defy dapps being base swap swap based and Stargate the hottest dab has definitely got to be friend Tech at the moment whose virality has managed to blast bases average TPS briefly to number one at least for a short while friendtech is a social dap which allows creators to monetize their Network and has been gaining a lot of traction on crypto Twitter with many in the community aping in and trying their hand at trading shares of popular figures which enable access to exclusive content and chat groups time will tell if it's yet another game of hot potato or if its model will be different and sustainable as many similar projects in the past such as bigcloud and rally have faded in popularity or died quiet deaths so far though this so-called social fight app has managed to secure a seed round funding from Paradigm break in 100 000 users and close in on 2 million in Daily fees generated surpassing top defy dapps like Lido and uniswap Hyper side there have also been a considerable share of skepticism from some of the community with many calling it out to be unsustainable have dodgy privacy issues and team and more so please dyor and ape at your own risk it's also not a bad idea to anonymize the wallet which you use to fund your friend Tech linked wallet address for instance sending funds from an exchange not much has been announced for base's roadmap Beyond its mainnet launch except for a few key goals for the progressive decentralization and increase security of the platform over the rest of the year and into 2024. as it stands coinbase runs the only sequencer for the base Network though the same can be said about all other l2s whose core teams also run their sole sequencer coinbase is also working together with others on an upcoming ethereum upgrade eip4844 which could theoretically scale l2s even further reducing fees by another 10 to 100 times naturally they also intend to attract Builders and have set up a base ecosystem fund though there's no mention of the amount allocated based succeeding as a dominant L2 would mean a significant Revenue bump for coinbase whether through sequencer fees or from any successful dapps built by coinbase in in future some clues for coinbase's direction can be gleaned from its secret master plan published all the way back in 2016 where phases 3 and 4 that is build a mass-market interface for digital currency apps and build the apps of an open Financial system seem to be underway lastly base has explicitly stated that they have currently no plans to issue a new network token but with its plans to progressively decentralize in the coming months this may change in the future coinbase launching its own chain certainly draws parallels to when binance announced BNB chain previously known as binance smart chain for the folks who haven't been around that long now if history is any indication when bullish times return we could expect an explosion of activity and new users onboarded enabled by fast and cheap transactions together with its affiliation to coinbase however BNB chain was also notorious for the countless scams and Rec pools which launched on the platform so do keep a watch out on base well that wraps up our overview of base for now if you want to find out what the other top hot and

MZn1Li18n0I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZn1Li18n0I,hey there are you considering a job in crypto well if yes then I have some interesting statistics for you so according to a report by LinkedIn and okx the number of individuals working in the blockchain industry increased by 76 year on year as of June 2022. the growth rate in terms of the number of job listings related to blockchain technology is just as impressive with countries like Spain Brazil and Canada registering an increase of over 500 percent in the same period now we may be currently in a bear Market but the opportunities are available so how can you capitalize on them and hopefully land a job in crypto well let's find out okay so there isn't a specific Playbook to follow but generally speaking one of the first steps in getting a job in the industry is to identify a niche so let's look at some of the most popular jobs in crypto so that you can get a clear picture of the options available so the majority of job openings in crypto are Tech related and perhaps the first thing that comes to mind when you think of a job in crypto these include roles such as blockchain or smart contract development so blockchain developers take on Advanced technical roles and are also among the highest paid Professionals in the industry if you're eyeing this role as a beginner you'll need to build your programming skills first now this means learning popular blockchain and smart contract programming languages like C plus rust solidity and and general languages like Python and SQL to communicate with databases and build interactive dashboards you also need a deep understanding of cryptography blockchain architecture and finance okay so then similarly web development is another in demand skill in crypto so it involves writing code for a website's back and front end to allow users to seamlessly interact with the product web developers are also responsible for maintaining the website and constantly updating it to improve the user experience while ensuring security clearly the learning curve here is as steep as it gets and opportunities here are more suitable to those with an existing background in these fields but hey anybody who is willing to learn experiments and Implement could find success here another common role in crypto is technical writing so technical writers are responsible for communicating complex information in a way that is easy to understand so you've read or heard of white papers in crypto right so chances are a technical writer was hired by the founders to present their ideas in the simplest way possible and where needed put forward technical Concepts in an organized manner on top of that they write guides manuals and articles just to name a few so technical writers are great communicators researchers and problem solvers okay so those are a few common technical jobs available in crypto but non-technical roles are on the rise as well as the industry expands product management is one example of such a role so product managers provide the link between the blockchain experts and the business entity now they have good communication skills since they work as a connecting bridge between the two and also great product management skills since they are responsible for creating road maps and assigning tasks to the development team basically they are equipped to oversee the product development phase of a project then another non-technical role in crypto is crypto Community Management so professionals specializing in this sector are responsible for looking after a Project's engagement strategy and communication via online community so think Discord telegram or Reddit crypto Community managers handle the queries of clients among other tasks in these platforms and that's why they need to be well versed in the project details and also have good people skills the few roles we have highlighted are of course just the tip of the iceberg the industry has other job sectors like Business Development where professionals develop new business and customer relationships for their organization marketing to increase brand awareness or research and financial analysts who collect and analyze data about the industry say you have the skills and already decided on a niche the next step is to look for opportunities so job boards on platforms like LinkedIn and indeed are great places to start now there are also some job boards that are solely focused on the crypto industry crypto job lists is a great example the platform is one of the most popular and longest running in the industry so job listings and new positions here are added daily or you can submit your work qualifications on Alliance which will help you share your profile with web 3 startups another unique job platform is Angel list the platform is not dedicated to blockchain but often lists blockchain startup jobs that are otherwise unavailable elsewhere projects also advertise openings on their website and social media platforms so make sure to keep an eye out on those as well what if you have no experience well networking is a powerful tool whether you already have some experience or if you're just starting out let's say you fall in the latter category you can use the power of social media to network start by creating an online track record by writing posts that demonstrate your interests and knowledge in the industry while at this stage try to learn as much as you can about crypto if you're taking a relevant course even better prospective employers will also likely appreciate the hands-on experience so experimenting and gaining experience using blockchain and web3 dapps will definitely be a plus beginners can head over to web3 Centric learning platforms like rabbit hole and layer 3 to complete quests and bounties and even earn some crypto or nfts along the way while you're still learning reach out to projects via socials like Twitter or Discord and offer to volunteer if you're comfortable with that idea so join the Discord channels of your favorite projects connect with people and learn as much as you can social media platforms help you to keep an online track record which may come in handy in the future there are a ton of opportunities offered in the crypto industry and all of them are not necessarily technical but you will still need some basic knowledge and passion for the technology whether you're eyeing to be a blockchain developer or a content creator the fundamentals remain learn Network search for opportunity and then rinse and repeat so what is your crypto dream job well let us know in the comments [Music] foreign [Music],Youtube video,TOP Crypto Jobs and How To Get A Job in 2024

ovnE5gQ3fQQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovnE5gQ3fQQ,since its emergence in the mid-1990s social media has become an integral part of our everyday lives YouTube Instagram Snapchat Tick Tock we've come a long way since the days of pigeons and now social media is a worldwide phenomenon yes it's undeniable that they have many benefits and catching features but there's the other side to consider too censorship suppression of speech social manipulation privacy concerns the current landscape of social media is complex and controversial an ad filled profit driven hotbed of monopolistic companies competing to collect and sell your data big brother is watching you but just imagine what if there's a world without him well Q decentralized social media first let's talk about what decentralized social media actually is as the name suggests these social networks operate in a well decentralized manner it's a paradigm shift from traditional social media platforms that are centralized and controlled by a single Authority where the power is instead distributed among its users these decentralized platforms offer certain advantages over their centralized counterparts like enhanced privacy transparency security and full control over your data digital identity and content with no Central Authority controlling or manipulating content Free Speech prevails thoughts and ideas can flourish without fear of censorship and if you're worried about your private information being sold to the data miners out there so they can sell you more stuff that you don't need with ads that you don't want to watch these decentralized platforms give users control of their own data and transactions which means more empowerment and privacy for you and your loved ones then there's also another sub aspect of decentralized social media called social Finance or social Phi for short a hybrid concept fusing social media networks with web3 and D5 introducing a Creator economy driven by monetization models using fungible and non-fungible tokens nfts at the heart of social phi's monetization is the concept of social tokens a form of in-app utility tokens used to drive a Creator economy where content creators are rewarded for their contributions decentralized social networks represent a fundamental shift in the infrastructure of social media platforms empowering users and fostering a more transparent secure and user-centric online experience but it's not all just sunshine and rainbows okay it's not always rainbows and sun Sunshine one obstacle is attracting a large user base as people are more accustomed to centralized platforms decentralized networks also have a steeper learning curve that could deter non-techy users scalability is also an issue due to the decentralized nature of these networks making it challenging to handle large amounts of traffic and data blockchain based networks are subject to cryptocurrency Market volatility affecting rewards for Content creators and the stability of the network insufficient funds could lead to network shutdowns disrupting user connections not to mention potential regulatory challenges too as there are no Global standards for blockchains and Regulators all around are already cracking down on the crypto space as the technology evolves Solutions May emerge to address these drawbacks and despite the challenges decentralized social media still holds immense potential for a more trans parent and user-centric online experience if you hadn't already caught on notice that we've mentioned that there are actually two types of decentralized social media platforms blockchain based and non-blockchain based blockchain-based platforms Leverage The Power of blockchain technology to provide transparency immutability and tokenization by storing user data and content on a blockchain these platforms ensure content cannot be tampered with or removed without consensus and as seen from social fi blockchain-based platforms like steemit and lens protocol often incorporate native tokens these are used to incentivize user participation content creation and Community engagement and they offer the potential for a more decentralized and economically incentivized social media ecosystem on the other hand non-blockchain based platforms employ alternative Technologies and models to achieve decentralization these platforms May rely on Federated systems where data is distributed across multiple servers or nodes this approach allows for greater control over data and content as well as enhanced privacy and censorship resistance like its blockchain based counterparts non-blockchain platforms also often focus on user empowerment and Community Driven governance both of these Solutions come with their own set of considerations blockchain-based Solutions may offer immutability and better transparency but they lack the scalability of non-blockchain platforms the availability of token rewards is also a double-edged sword yes they help incentivize and attract participation but the volatility of crypto can also introduce uncertainty into the economic model of blockchain-based solutions plus there's also an argument to be made about organic versus profit driven inorganic content and what will happen when these incentives are no longer attractive well ultimately the choice between blockchain based and non-blockchain based comes down to individual preferences and priorities now let's take a look at some of the top social media protocols and Platforms in the decentralized space one prominent blockchain based example is lens protocol by Ave which functions as a social graph platform catering to many social apps like YouTube and Twitter it's also an Open Secret at this point that there will be a lens airdrop coming soon too another noteworthy protocol is Mastodon a non-blockchain based decentralized social media platform it operates on a Federated model where multiple interconnected servers or instances form a network each instance can have its own rules and moderation policies enabling users to choose communities that align with their preferences then there are also projects like diaspora Damas hepath Hive and many more all offering their own unique spin on decentralized social media in inclusion decentralized social media or social fi presents a promising alternative to centralized social media platforms while both centralized and decentralized platforms have their pros and cons the feature of decentralized social media holds immense potential for fostering great user empowerment privacy and control over personal data in fact even web 2 platforms like Reddit meta and Twitter are already experimenting with decentralized elements as the community continues to innovate and overcome the challenges faced by decentralized platforms we can anticipate a more inclusive transparent and resilient social media landscape well that wraps it up for this video check out our previous video to learn more about how account abstraction could make decentralized social media a possibility [Music] thank you,Youtube video,Why We NEED Decentralized Social Media,2023-08-25

_vHyMkv-m1M,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vHyMkv-m1M,today we're diving into the exciting world of layer 2 Solutions growth is a fantastic thing but it often comes with its fair share of growing pains as more users flock to blockchains like ethereum scalability started to become a major challenge transactions were taking longer and became more expensive but don't worry that's where layer twos swoop in to save the day they're designed to increase speeds and reduce those pesky transaction fees new l2s like mantle and Linea have kick-started a new wave of interest in these ecosystems with many users pinning their hopes on an airdrop similar to what we've seen from arbitrary and optimism even BNB chain a POS chain designed to be hyperscalable from the beginning has also recently rolled out an L2 called opbmb it does seem that L2 season is well and truly alive once more most of us are familiar with the big four layer 2's arbitrary from optimism ZK sync and starknet but nowadays it seems that new layer twos are popping up left and right you can hardly keep track of all of them but we've got you covered with the most notable ones in this video first up is buy bits mantle Network a new chain that only recently went live in July built on ethereum mantle insurers users are able to enjoy ethereum security framework plus they offer significantly lower gas fees by having the validator notes collect transactions from users and committing them to ethereum in the form of a compressed block this compression helps to save users from awfully expensive gas fees and increases the total possible throughput for transactions in May this year a proposal passed for a bit Dow and mantle to Rebrand as the mantle ecosystem mantle uses bit as its governance token and gas token with a tvl of 40 million at the time when this video was made next in line is base an ethereum layer 2 Chain incubated within coinbase it offers an easy way for applications to integrate seamlessly with coinbase's ecosystem and access over 130 billion in asset it's on the platform at a fraction of the cost users gain access to the evm environment and enjoy Early Access to ethereum features including account abstraction gasless transactions developer apis and smart contract wallets while bass currently does not have a token it initially attracted a lot of attention and gained over 40 million in tvl with the launch of the meme coin bald before taking a plunge to under 10 million due to its alleged rug however it quickly recovered and took off again to reach 170 million at time of shooting as their on-chain summer campaign is underway which will run till the end of August our next optimistic roll-up layer 2 is opbmb a scaling solution for the BNB smart chain powered by a Bedrock version of the optimism op stack it has the ability to offload transaction processing and resource usage from the BNB smart chain all while still posting data to the underlying mainnet it's a win-win situation users can interact with the network by depositing their funds from BSC and using the available applications and contracts on opbnb currently opbnb is still in its test net stage but is expected to use BNB for gas fees once live now we're moving into our first of many ZK Roll-Ups developed by consensus the makers of metamask Linea is a fully evm equivalent layered to network it boasts lower gas fees high capacity and scalability while still providing developers with the same tools and infrastructure as ethereum freshly launched on the mainnet Linea has already achieved a tvl of 12 million as of now the consensus team has no immediate plans for a linear token meaning users will continue to use e for gas fees moving on let's take a look at polygon ZK evm as a decentralized ethereum layer 2 scalability solution polygon's own approach on zika evm uses cryptographic zero knowledge proofs to offer validity and quick finality to off-chain transaction computation gas fees on polygon zkevm are paid using Matic and the current tvl stands at 31 million up next we have scroll which is an open source Open Door Community Driven layer 2 that aims to achieve a ZK evm that is so similar to the ethereum virtual machine that Builders won't even know the difference plus their transparency is unmatched with every line of code playing out in real time on GitHub for everyone to see although scroll is currently on testnet their mainnet launch is just around the corner while there is no official confirmation of a scroll token their roadmap outlines an incentive mechanism strongly hinting at the likelihood of a token arriving soon now time for some nft action with immutable X the first linear 2 scaling solution designed specifically for nfts on ethereum immutable X eliminates limitations and enhances the nft and gaming experience with improved scalability and smoother interactions they support every ethereum wallet type ensuring that users have a seamless experience from gaming platforms to nft marketplaces IMX serves as the governance token and currently holds a tvl of 29 million our final layer 2 is the first ever hybrid roll-up metis is an ethereum layer 2 platform that offers simple and fast smart contract deployment they are currently working on combining optimistic roll-up architecture with zero knowledge roll-up security and finality to offer the ultimate experience metis also offers an exclusive list of products including metas nft Bridge meta's oracles metas nodes and meta sub graph plus it doesn't hurt that vitalik's Mom is also the founder medicine employs medicine as its governance token and for covering gas fees currently its dvl stands at 40 million there are many other L2 Solutions out there that we haven't been able to cover in this video including fuel the first optimistic roll up on mainnet ethereum that was deployed back in 2020 Taiko an ethereum equivalent ZK evm that recently rolled out l3s according to Tycho l2s are for general purpose scaling whereas l3s will be dedicated to customized scaling Solutions Aztec the first hybrid ZK roll-up supporting both public and private smart contract execution as well as many more that have also gotten their fair share of attention from the crypto space all with a unique approach towards ethereum scaling Solutions well that was quite a journey into the world of layer 2 Solutions these new chains are the key to making blockchain much more scalable and accessible for the masses but there's also the question how many is too many and do we even need that many to begin with well safe to say not all of them will succeed and only time will tell which will prevail now it's your turn to join the conversation which layer 2 solution caught your eye and why and if you're hungry for more knowledge about ZK evm projects well then check out our previous video right here foreign [Music] foreign,Youtube video,"Top Crypto LAYER 2s to Keep An Eye On (Base, Linea, Mantle)",2023-08-21

jBCXf8yylQA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBCXf8yylQA,this video will tell you everything you need to know about trustwallet and how you can get started with it in just five minutes trustwallet is a versatile software cryptocurrency wallet available both on mobile and as a desktop browser extension you can use trustwallet to transact and store a variety of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ethereum Solana and even nfts you can also interact with d apps through an open source browser directly via their mobile app but first things first here's how you can set up trustwallet on your Android or iOS smartphone first download the app from the Google Play store or the app Store make sure to double check that you're installing the legitimate version of the app you can do this by getting a download link from the official website on trustwallet.com to be sure once you have installed the trustwallet app open it and you'll be prompted to create a new wallet or import an existing one for now let's select create a new wallet you'll then need to accept the terms and conditions then create a six digit passcode for you to access the app and approve transactions later on next you'll begin given some important reminders regarding your 12 to 24 word seed or recovery phrase which will be shown to you next after you're showing your seed phrase it's highly advisable not to click on copy or store the passphrase in your device but instead write down your seed phrase and keep it somewhere safe and in the next screen you'll be asked to verify that you've noted down your secret phrase by arranging them in the correct order you should always make sure to keep your recovery phrase in a safe place as this is the only way to access your wallet and your funds should you lose access to your device or forget your password and voila you've just completed your wallet setup that wasn't so hard was it now to start using the wallet you'll need to get hold of some funds you can either do this by purchasing crypto directly from the app or by transferring crypto from another wallet or exchange where your funds are let's first look at how you would purchase crypto directly on the app on the home screen you'll see see the buy button select the crypto you want to buy from the many options available where you'll be quoted the best exchange rate from one of their several third-party providers click buy and you'll be redirected to a payment Gateway where you can make your purchase via debit or credit card do note though that there is a 50 minimum purchase requirement and there are typically higher fees involved when purchasing directly with your card what about if you've already purchased crypto on a centralized exchange and want to transfer your funds into trust wallet instead the self-custody your funds and Trust wallet click on receive on the home screen select the desired crypto and you'll be shown a QR code along with an address which you can send crypto to if you use binance or coinbase to buy your crypto that's good news for you as trustwallet has additional Integrations with these exchanges which makes transferring funds even simpler on the bottom of the receive screen you'll see deposit from exchange which can initiate a direct transfer from your binance or base account just select your exchange and follow the prompts if you've used another exchange don't worry as the process will still be relatively simple copy the address from your trust wallet log into your exchange account navigate to the withdrawal section select the coin and amount you want to withdraw then carefully paste the address on the exchange withdrawal page or click on the Square icon to scan the QR code on your trust wallet then double check the transaction details and confirm make sure that the address entered is correct and that you have selected the right Network for the crypto you're transferring the next thing we'll go over briefly is how to install trust wallets recently released browser extension which you can use on your desktop to interact with the apps head over to trustwallet's official site and go over to the browser extension Tab and click on Get Trust wallet you'll be directed to your browser app store where you can download the extension which is available on many browsers such as Chrome Brave and Opera and again similar to the mobile wallet you'll be prompted to either create a new wallet or import an existing wallet you'll then need to set a password for the wallet and then follow a couple of additional steps before you're done with the wallet setup pretty simple UI u x Wise It's very similar to other browser extension wallets trustwallet has the added benefit of having popular chains like BNB chain Avalanche and polygon add out of the box last but not least you need to know how to import export or restore your trust wallet if you've lost or switched your device or reinstalled your app for whatever reason importing your trust browser extension wallet into your phone and vice versa will also follow similar steps this is where your seed phrase is crucial but make sure you're on the official apps and be wary of phishing attempts if you've just installed the app you can click on I already have a wallet straight away and follow the prompts from there otherwise go to the settings page select wallets then tap on the plus button where you can do the same select multi-coin wallet then key in your seed phrase here and voila you're done if your funds are not being displayed correctly you may simply have to click on ADD tokens and toggle on the desired crypto a side note on the off chance you need to view your seed phrase again you can still do so while you still have access to your mobile or browser extension wallet in the mobile app head over to settings then go to wallets and click on the ellipses next to the desired wallet then click on show secret phrase where you'll be prompted for your passcode to view it you can also do the same on the browser extension click on settings and view secret phrase keep it somewhere else safe this time so to wrap up trustwallet may be the choice for you if you're looking for Simplicity and ease of use as well as versatility in exploring different blockchain networks as well as evm chains looking for other options or wondering how trustwallet compares to the popular metamask wallet you've probably heard of check out our video on metamask versus trust wallet here,Youtube video,What Is TRUST WALLET? | Beginner’s Trust Wallet Tutorial In 2024,2023-08-17

FzgE0EPFpfY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzgE0EPFpfY,let's be honest crypto is not the easiest thing to get started with you need to create a wallet remember these 12 to 24 random words carve them into a fireproof steel plate figure way around this confusing thing called metamask learn about gas priority fees chain configuration dexes and animation all these scary scams and hacks lurking in every corner of the world gosh why can't crypto be as easy as just sending a message well this right here is the premise of the latest cult that has graced the crypto space telegram bot coins now imagine if you could create a wallet buy and sell tokens as easily as just sending a message on telegram literally that's a telegram trading bot the problem with crypto is the terrible user experience now instead of trying to decipher the UI of dexes and wallets you can easily perform all your trading needs with just a single command sent on telegram fast easy convenient the leader of this telegram bot pack is undoubtedly unibot which allows users to trade on uniswap Via telegram at the time this video was made unibot tokens have shot up 380 percent in just a single month and analytics also show that active users have been rapidly climbing in fact telegram Bots is such a huge phenomenon that a whole sub-genre of crypto has been spun off inspiring many similar projects like weiji bot which is another trading bot and loot bot which automates airdrop farming that are also riding on similar success and if you're thinking I'm A battle-hardened og crypto veteran I don't need a bot to hold my hand well you may want to think again unless you can already execute multiple transactions across multiple wallets simultaneously with just a single click you want to stick around and learn more and that's just one of the many features okay first let's go over the very Basics to begin we need to first open up the unibot sniper underscore bought on telegram once you're in click Start and just like that with just a single click and mere seconds you've created three brand new wallets for you to trade with Meanwhile your old school friend is probably still creating a password on metamask on the first of many pages to come to start trading on telegram we need to send some funds to at least one of the wallets which can be easily done through centralized exchanges like binance or coinbase or with one of your existing wallets and just like other wallets you can also choose to export these wallet and their private keys to be used on medmask for instance or import your existing wallets to trade on telegram instead once you've uploaded a wallet with funds on unibot you're ready for the fun part to start trading click on buy token and a menu will appear that allows you to input the buy amount and slippage you'd also notice that there is a select wallet section that lets you toggle the wallets used this right here is one of the many features that makes unibot so powerful should you wish you can select all three wallets and all three wallets will be used to trade all at once once you're ready paste in the token address press enter and voila you're now the proud owner of a new coin and all three wallets just make sure that you have the right token address which can be found and copied easily on coin gecko selling tokens is also just as easy as buying them simply select the sell amount slippage and type in the wallet number to be used for instance typing in one two three here means that you'll be selling 100 of all the tokens from all three wallets at a ten percent slippage these telegram Bots can also do a lot more than just buying and selling tokens here are some of the other features that they have private transactions which can help avoid sandwich attacks that result in a higher cost the trade-off is sacrificing a bit of speed for your transactions mirror snipe which lets users copy trade and front-run other users token value monitor that informs you of any price shifts allowing you to act accordingly limit orders that let you buy and sell tokens automatically at a predetermined price Revenue share well not exactly a feature is what lends utility to the unibot tokens unibot holders are entitled to receive 40 percent of the total transaction fees as well as one percent of the token trading volume holders can also generate a referral link that lets successful referrers receive 25 percent of transaction fees from users who use the link as well as a 20 discount off their transaction fees these features which are not natively available on many dabs plus the ease of use is what makes telegram bots so appealing to even veteran users other Bots like loot bot bolt while performing other functions also work similarly to unibot in terms of how they can be operated solely through telegram but like all things it's not all sunshine and roses for these things the rising interest in telegram based trading Bots have also sparked concerns about their security to make trading accessible these telegram Bots create the wallets for you now you saw how fast it took to create three wallets oh and the sacred private keys that should never be shared well they're held on the platform because of this trading is made a lot faster and simpler since the Bots can now authorize transactions on your behalf however this raises the question of self-custody you know the entire reason why crypto exists in the first place and remember importing your existing wallets also means sharing your private key with the platform so who's to say that these platforms will be secure one data breach or hack and all of your on-chain fortunes could be wiped out so make sure to take necessary precautions so telegram Bots make crypto much more accessible and beginner friendly Paving the way to wider adoption now there are valid security concerns but good practices like using it as a secondary wallet with limited buns and never linking your main wallet to the platform can let you enjoy all the features while limiting your vulnerability and like many other hot Trends in crypto expect many copycats rugs and malicious acts coming from telegram bot coin space

kwRJK6QQzso,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwRJK6QQzso,Google's unofficial motto had long been don't be evil the phrase don't be evil was deeply baked into Google's corporate culture don't be evil don't be evil and served as the bat signal to always always be on the side of good then of course in 2018 they removed it and here's the thing about don't be evil you're still trusting that the good guys would remain good and well look what happened but what if we gave this a little tweak instead to can't be evil what if we didn't have to trust anyone picture a truly open free and trustless internet one that's backed by cryptographic and mathematical proofs rather than the wills and whims of humans well this is the motto of stacks [Music] Stacks is an open source blockchain anchored to the Bitcoin Network Stacks introduces smart contracts with a coding language known as Clarity allowing dabs to be deployed on the Bitcoin Network in 2013 munib Ali and Ryan Shea founded block stack the original name of stacks their Journey began at Princeton University's computer science department where they developed block stock technology to address the challenges faced in today's websites and smartphone applications the plan was to reduce the dependence on centralized cloud service providers eliminating the need for applications to store user information to function the goal was similar to bitcoin empowering users by offering decentralized Alternatives that prioritize privacy and security after years of research Stacks finally launched its mainnet in 2018. the project held in Ico in 2019 securing over 75 million in funding from prominent investors including Union Square Ventures Winklevoss Capital Lux capital and more fun fact the sdx token Ico was the first in history to be SEC approved and the stacks team actually had to work closely with the SEC for over a year to make this Ico happen a significant update to the network came in January 2020 and since then it's been commonly referred to as stocks 2.0 this update was a major Milestone that natively connected and anchored Stacks to bitcoin stocks utilizes a mechanism called proof of transfer or POs to connect with Bitcoin piox connects to bitcoin with a one-to-one block ratio meaning anything that happens on the stacks can also be verified on Bitcoin in POS Bitcoin miners spent Bitcoin to participate in mining and create new blocks on the stocks blockchain unlike traditional proof of work systems pox replaces electricity consumption with minted Bitcoin as proof of computation put another way POS requires miners to spend Bitcoin to compete rather than electricity eliminating the need for excessive energy consumption one of the unique features of pox is its stacking process instead of burning the BTC used as a proxy for computing resources miners send it to stackers who have locked their sdx tokens in exchange for Bitcoin rewards from miners in other words you can support the stacks blockchain and earn Bitcoin simply by buying and locking sdx tokens through this connection Stax is able to leverage the security and network effects of Bitcoin all while adding programmability and smart contracts to the ecosystem since Stacks is anchored to the Bitcoin Network the time to mine a stocks Block matches the expected block time of Bitcoin which is on average 10 minutes but this does not mean that stocks is only as scalable as its cousins the sax blockchain has implemented a clever solution solution known as micro blocks which enhances transaction throughput and Speed Stacks blocks that are confirmed simultaneously to bitcoin blocks are called anchor blocks and these occur every 10 minutes on average according to bitcoin's mining algorithm in between those anchor blocks micro blocks are also created which make for Rapid settlement of stacks transactions transactions included in microblocks will be confirmed once the associated anchor block has been approved this mechanism ensures scalability for the stacks blockchain enabling increased transaction throughput beyond the limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain you should know by now that scx is the native coin of stacks like other coins STX is used to pay transaction fees and can also be stacked or locked directly on the network to earn Bitcoin rewards and just like Bitcoin scx also has a Cap supply of 1.82 billion the issuance of sdx tokens follows a having schedule that Mary first out of Bitcoin it means that a Miner's rewards per block will drop from its 1000 sdx down to 500 sdx which is what it is currently then of course 250 finally 125 STX once it reaches 125 STX this will remain the reward for mining indefinitely at this rate the total sdx Supply will reach the cap by year 2050. thanks to the attention generated by ordinals as part of the Bitcoin ecosystem Stacks has also witnessed some tremendous growth its tvl has quadrupled since the start of this year but at this point the ecosystem as a whole is still relatively small compared to the leading all chains or l2s like arbitrim and BNB chain with billions of dollars so what are some of the major projects on Stacks well there's stack swap which is the unit swap of stacks Alex lab which is the all-in-one solution that allows users trade Farm earn and even launch projects similar to Camelot on arbitrim or pancake swap on BNB chain ARCA dico which is a self-repaying loan platform using Bitcoin earned from stacking gamma a Bitcoin nft Marketplace and Creator launch pad on Stacks liquidium a nft lending platform and many more there are two major updates coming our way in Stacks first up is Stax BTC or sbtc a new asset that will be pegged one to one with Bitcoin in this system users peg in and send regular Bitcoin to a wallet controlled by stackers this action means an equivalent number of sbtc that can be used in smart contracts on Stacks to Peg out and get their Bitcoin back users return sbtc to the wallet stackers then sign these Peg out requests and release the equivalent amount of Bitcoin back to the users however transaction speed will still need to improve and this is is where the second update Nakamoto release comes in in this release further speed and scalability upgrades will be introduced to improve transaction times to 5 Seconds by unlocking VTC liquidity through sbtc adaps Stacks will be able to create a flywheel economy that can help grow the ecosystem the fact that there's 5.1 billion worth of BTC floating around in the ethereum system is proof that there is demand for using BTC and defy and Beyond just a simple store of value Stacks is a groundbreaking blockchain that brings programmability to bitcoin while preserving its security and network effects through its POS mechanism Stacks creates a strong link between its native cryptocurrency sdx and Bitcoin fostering a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship yes the ecosystem is still relatively small in terms of tvl but with the upcoming updates and having so close many are already predicting an up tick in activities and demand interested in learning more about the Bitcoin ecosystem and ordinals will then check out our previous video right

-TCBlFc9nak,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TCBlFc9nak,while some may think that Bitcoin is boring in this bear market we've seen the rise of ordinals nfts and tokens on the network on top of clear evidence of institutional interest with the flurry of spot Bitcoin ETF filings by Trad Phi behemoths like BlackRock Fidelity and Invesco so it may make sense to pay attention to bitcoin and its ecosystem if you haven't already been doing so if you're asking what ecosystem well then stay tuned contrary to popular belief smart contracts are actually possible on the Bitcoin network but because it is coded in the script programming language which is not Turing complete it's programmability and thus smart contract functionality is limited some examples of smart contracts on the Bitcoin main net include things like paid to public key hash multi-signature time lock contract discrete log contracts and pay to Tap Root which we won't get into here but are essentially used for implementing various forms of Bitcoin transactions the lightning Network which you may have heard of is one example of a Bitcoin layer 2 which uses simple main chain smart contracts like multi-cigs htlcs and DLCs to enable fast and cheap micro payments of Bitcoin for day-to-day transactions the lightning network is currently bitcoin's largest L2 by TBL with about 150 million locked at the moment however to access the possibility of full-fledged D5 and nft dapps on bitcoin like the ones we see on chains like ethereum Bitcoin needs sidechain or layer 2 Solutions akin to polygon arbitrum or optimism that have more programmability built in some of the main projects which are working on exactly this include stacks and rootstock so let's take a look at those so rootstock AKA rsk was one of the early if not earliest entrants in this space having launched its main net in January 2018. rsk is a Bitcoin side chain and it's connected to bitcoin via something called merge mining so this allows it to borrow some of bitcoin's underlying security as Bitcoin miners can choose to dual mine rootstock simultaneously with the Bitcoin blockchain with no additional cost and earned transaction fees from rsk rsk enables smart contracts on on bitcoin using its rsk virtual machine which is a slightly modified implementation of the evm and so is compatible with it therefore daps written in solidity can be deployed and popular evm web3 wallets like metamask can be used to interact and transact on the rsk network it currently has a tvl of about 94 million which is primarily made up by D5 protocols money on chain and Sovereign the other main project is Stacks which is arguably the more prominent player in this Niche at the moment despite having a lower tvl than rootstock it also works somewhat like a side chain similar to polygon but for Bitcoin the project has been around for a while now with an initial version launching all the way back in late 2018 and the current version in January 2021. Stacks inherits the security of the Bitcoin Network by anchoring its transactions onto the Bitcoin main chain it also uses a novel consensus is mechanism called proof of transfer which incentivizes Bitcoin miners with their native token sdx for transferring and securing Bitcoin on the stacks Network smart contracts on Stacks are programmed with the clarity language made specifically for the platform and meant to improve some of the shortcomings of solidity stocks currently has a TV out of about 44 million and hosts five D5 protocols according to D5 llama although this is low it's worth noting that this is three to four times higher than it was at the start of the year it probably benefited from the spillover effects due to the rise of ordinals there are also other smaller projects like new Bitcoin City who recently deployed a BRC 20 decks forked from uniswap Smart contracts on their Bitcoin layer 2 platform as you may have noticed TBL on these Bitcoin based platforms is low even when compared to many alt chains which themselves are a Far Cry 2 ethereum and the few adapts that have been built on them haven't gained the most traction however at this point we can clearly see that Bitcoin is or can evolve to be more than the pet rock that some have dismissed it as well what do you think is Bitcoin headed in a good direction or do you think it just needs to stick to being plain old money like Satoshi envisioned well this only scratches the surface as it's just an introduction to bitcoin's ecosystem but leave us a like if you've learned something from this video or drop a comment if you want us to cover something more in depth while these layer 2 like platforms can support nfts and tokens they're actually different from the nfts and tokens on ordinals so learn more about ordinals Bitcoin nfts and tokens from our earlier videos on ordinals and brz20s [Music] thank you,Youtube video,Top Bitcoin LAYER 2s to Watch in 2023,2023-08-07 00:00:00,338.0,CoinGecko
hOHxF2l-6Vo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOHxF2l-6Vo,if you've been keeping up with the crypto Market lately it's likely that you've heard the buzz surrounding Bitcoin and crypto ETFs BlackRock shook the market with a surprise spot Bitcoin ETF application on June 15th and ignited a week-long rally for Bitcoin in response to this several other investment firms rushed to file their own applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF within the same month in today's video we will explore what crypto ETFs are and what this attention around spot Bitcoin ETFs is all about first of all what is an ETF an ETF is an investment fund designed to track the performance of underlying assets such as stocks bonds currencies Futures contracts and commodities like gold similarly a crypto ETF is basically just an investment fund that tracks the performance of one or more cryptocurrencies and even other crypto related assets like stock of crypto companies but for now we'll focus on the two main types of crypto ETFs which will be relevant to understand for this video Futures ETFs and spot ETFs first let's have a look at spot crypto ETFs spot crypto ETFs are backed by physical crypto meaning that when an investor buys shares of a spot crypto ETF the issuer of the ETF needs to actually buy and custody the corresponding amount of crypto therefore investors indirectly own the crypto purchase by the investment firm manage managing the fund the share price of the ETF reflects the price of the underlying crypto held by the fund so far the SEC has yet to approve a spot crypto ETF for the U.S market despite multiple filings over X years however the world's first spot Bitcoin ETF is the purpose Bitcoin ETF launched on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada back in 2021. then we have crypto Futures ETFs which track the price movement of crypto Futures by buying crypto Futures contracts rather than holding actual crypto in case you needed a reminder Futures contracts are a type of financial derivative which allow investors to buy or sell the asset at a predetermined price in the future it's also worth mentioning that prices of Futures contracts tend to diverge from its underlying asset as it is based on Market sentiment of the Futures Market pro shares Bitcoin strategy ETF is the first crypto Futures ETF to be approved by the SEC in 20 2021 so what are the benefits of crypto ETFs crypto ETFs allow investors to gain crypto exposure without personally holding actual crypto this removes the barrier of acquiring storing and transferring crypto between wallets and exchanges for investors besides traditional and institutional investors will find crypto ETFs to be appealing as they can be traded in ways similar to a stock the crypto industry is still young and largely unregulated with crypto ETFs investors can gain exposure to crypto assets managed by trusted investment firms like BlackRock Fidelity and van Eck providing a regulated and convenient way to access the crypto Market another benefit of crypto ETFs is diversification an ETF that holds a basket of different crypto provides a One-Stop shop for investors looking to create a diversified crypto portfolio while there are numerous benefits when it comes to investing into crypto TFS there are also some disadvantages ETFs do not track crypto prices perfectly and often lag behind the underlying crypto they are meant to track investment firms would also charge crypto ETFs investors an annual management fee usually about one percent of the investment this could make crypto ETFs a costly investment over the long term on the flip side not directly owning crypto could also be a disadvantage as crypto ETFs are centralized this exposes investors to counterparty risk as the investment firm managing the ETF acts as the custodian of the underlying crypto assets As the adage goes not your keys not your coins as of now Bitcoin features ETFs Remain the only form of crypto ETF available in the US market despite the increasing demand for a spot Bitcoin ETF the SEC has been resistant to approving one having rejected about 30 proposal rules in the past supposedly due to concerns over the lack of Regulation and potential Market manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin Market however last month the market stirred as BlackRock the world's largest asset manager with over 9 trillion AUM applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF in response other Trad fight Titans like Fidelity and vesco and van Eck rushed to submit their own application in hopes for a spot Bitcoin ETF these initial applications were deemed lacking by the SEC citing it was insufficiently comprehensive however this was followed quickly with the submissions of revised applications which included a surveillance sharing agreement with coinbase to Monitor and Report any illegal activities in the spot Bitcoin Market recently it was announced that the SEC has acknowledged blackrock's revised application for review currently the SEC has accepted several spot Bitcoin ETF applications for review while approval for any of these applications is not guaranteed there is speculation that the SEC might finally approve a spot Bitcoin ETF the reasoning behind this is that it seems unlikely for the world's largest asset manager BlackRock to file an application that is likely to be rejected by the SEC The Firm has an impressive ETF approval history with 575 approvals and only one rejection rejected time will tell how the situation develops as the SEC has 45 days from the applications reaching the Federal Register to make a final decision on approval or rejection that will be soon as August 27th though it's worth noting that this deadline could be extended up to 240 days there's no denying that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would significantly add legitimacy to the crypto industry Bridging the Gap between the Trad Phi and crypto space the influx of institutional investors could lead to increase freeze demand for Bitcoin potentially driving up its price as a result while a spot Bitcoin ETF would no doubt Mark a major milestone for the crypto space it does pose some concerns the recent development regarding this surveillance sharing agreement involving coinbase racist concerns about privacy if a spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved this deal could Grant Regulators such as the SEC the power to request personal sensitive information about coinbase users including customers names and addresses the possibility of trotfy Institutions amassing significant amounts of Bitcoin may also leave some worrying about the centralization of wealth or power however this is a misconception as the Bitcoin network with its proof of work consensus mechanism does not Grant power to large token holders in the same way that proof of stake networks do additionally spot Bitcoin ETF issuers are obligated to buy hold and sell Bitcoin according to their investors as they serve to be the Bitcoin custodians of their clients they in theory don't necessarily own the underlying assets though it still remains that ETFs going mainstream would result in more individuals handing over custody to large institutions which concerns some that the ethos of Bitcoin would be eroded over time while concerns aside a spot Bitcoin ETF would still be beneficial for Bitcoin adoption as it provides a compliant investment vehicle for Pension funds Financial investors and traditional investors to incorporate Bitcoin into their portfolios well what do you think will the SEC finally approve a spot Bitcoin ETF or will BlackRock take their second ever L for an ETF application well on the topic of Bitcoin check out this video to learn about VRC 20 tokens on bitcoin [Music] thank you thank you,Youtube video,Spot BITCOIN ETF

1UgL7IXgjQM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UgL7IXgjQM,c network not to be confused with another high profile layer one that just recently launched is about to launch its mainnet soon like many other mainnet launches say network has come with its own Fanfare many have touted it to be the layer one for trading with a team themselves crowning say as the future of trading and the fastest L1 for trading but will it live up to the hype of becoming crypto's very own decentralized NASDAQ while we'll find out in this video okay so first let's go over the very Basics what is say so say is the brainchild of X Goldman Banker Jeff Fang and Jay jog a former Robin Hood software engineer who has been involved in the crypto industry since 2017. interestingly jog's inspiration to create say came from his observations of poor communication and a lack of transparency at Robinhood during the GameStop stock trading frenzy in 2021. it's important to note that say is not in exchange by itself but rather a layer 1 that's providing the infrastructure necessary to support the building of exchanges in fact it's the first layer one blockchain specifically designed to optimize the world of trading across defy nfts and GameFly on Cosmos in doing so they'll be able to operate better on say than anywhere else in other words decentralized NASDAQ one of the world's largest Marketplace for buying and trading Securities and traditional Finance in the past few months a network has been the subject of media Spotlight several times thanks to their high flying fundraises to date say has raised a total of 120 million with the latest round in April putting them at an 800 million valuation with an investor roster including the likes of jump crypto multi-coin Capital coinbase Ventures Delphi digital GSR Ventures and more it's no wonder that many have say on their radar let's try to understand what say is trying to solve here similar to the blockchain trilemma popularized by vitalik buterin say is addressing the challenge that they dubbed as the trading trilemma the idea goes like this trading of assets is a key component of the crypto industry from things like swapping of assets on dexes to purchasing in-game assets for blockchain games but despite this trading apps have failed to simultaneously achieve decentralization scalability and capital efficiency see existing layer 1 and layer 2 infrastructures Face difficulty in scaling and providing a good user experience and getting better ux usually comes with a drawback of relying on centralized exchanges like binance this is precisely where say comes in to support a decentralized equivalent of New York's second largest Stock Exchange so you will need to be able to deliver rapid transaction speeds with execution times on the order of microseconds so they do this by introducing a few features a built-in order matching engine which lets any developers building on top of say to easily create a scalable order book based exchange finality optimization of at least 600 Ms which will make say the fastest Cosmos SDK chain front running protection which helps to combat any malicious front-running activities parallel order execution a modified block production process that will help focus on order execution for defy and finally say's signature twin turbo consensus which as the name suggests contains two parts the first part is intelligent block propagation this Innovation allows say to speed up throughput where it can and slow down where it must resulting in a 40 increase in overall throughput compared to the vanilla tender mint consensus mechanism in the original tender mint structure block proposers used to send blocks that included all the transactions however validators already share transactions with each other during the transaction submission phase meaning that most validators already possess all the transactions in their local mempool intelligent block propagation is designed to improve the speed and efficiency of block processing with this feature block proposers can send compressed block proposals containing only transaction hashes instead of detailed block content since validators already gossip transactions between themselves at transactions and Mission most of them already have every transaction in their local mempool which can be used to quickly reconstruct the original block from compressed proposals the second part of the twin turbo consensus is optimistic block processing which can lead to an additional 33 percent in throughput in tender mints proposal phase a block is proposed and disseminated to other validators validators subsequently exchange pre-vote and pre-commit messages to reach a consensus on committing this particular block once the pre-commit message is transmitted validators proceed to process each transaction within the block and Carry Out State changes when there is a lot of data to process this stage can get quite slow with optimistic block processing say you can skip the pre-voting and pre-commit steps and start processing block proposals earlier resulting in Faster blog validation and voting however it's worth noting that this approach involves a trade-off in terms of decentralization say plans to operate with a restricted number of validators initially launching with only 50 on the main net making it one of the more centralized blockchains globally by comparison BNB chain which is often criticized for its limited decentralization currently has 41 validators even before its mainnet launch several protocols have already committed to building on same network with its ecosystem page already showing 119 projects ranging from infrastructure gaming D5 nfts wallets and more including familiar names like sushi xd5 kelper and more that wraps up our video about say let us know in the comments what you think about the project will it become a decentralized NASDAQ well if you're interested in learning more about a

ZP-kQBotUrs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP-kQBotUrs,the layer 1 scene has always been Dynamic with new projects popping up striving to achieve what their predecessors are struggling to among them are the recently launched suite and Aptos though the reception for these two projects recently has been mixed to say the least they have and continue to receive some Buzz due to their prominent BC backing new non-evm tech and association with meta's now shelved crypto project DM now sit back as we compare these two projects side by side starting with their founding teams sweet and Aptos both have teams composed of former meta employees after minute shelved its blockchain project Avery Ching a former Tech lead at Facebook and Mohammed Sheikh former strategic Partnerships lead for Facebook's wallet Novi left the company in 2021 to create opto's Labs the following year Aptos raised a total of 350 million in funding over three rounds led by Andresen Horowitz jump crypto Finance labs and FDX Ventures Suite on the other hand was created by mistin Labs a software company also launched in 2021 by former meta employees the corps members all played a key role in meta's crypto unit including CEO Evan Chang previously director of r d at Novi Financial CPO adeni abioden previously the product lead at Novi CTO Sam Blackshear and ex-principal engineer at Novi Chief scientist George denizes the ex-chief scientist at Novi and Chief cryptographer at misson labs and ex-chief cryptographer at meta after the team founded Mist in labs they raised a total of 336 million in funding over three rounds led by FDX Ventures and Andresen Horowitz clearly both projects are backed by prominent VCS and have solid teams behind them under the hood at the center of both projects is a programming language known as move move is a rest-based programming language that was originally created by one of Swiss core members Sam Blackshear to power Facebook's DM blockchain move supposedly addresses the vulnerabilities found in popular evm programming language solidity by making it harder for developers to write buggy code or encounter unexpected behaviors in their smart contracts Aptos uses the original move language but otherwise employs the same address-centric architecture as with many other blockchains meaning that most of the transactions on the blockchain involve modifying or managing data tied to specific addresses so for instance a transfer of an asset requires updating the ownership record of addresses of both the sender and recipient Suite however uses a modified version of move which introduces an object-centric model that deviates from the address Centric approach Swiss object-centric storage system means that it represents different elements on the blockchain like tokens or even smart contracts as objects so when a transfer or any other operation involving the object occurs the relevant functions only need to update the object's internal properties to reflect the changes in ownership which can be more efficient for a deeper breakdown of how suis object-centric model Works be sure to catch our video introducing the project after you're done with this one both projects are also trying to tackle scalability issues through parallel execution of transactions though they both execute this in different ways in Aptos parallel execution is implemented using a technique called block SDM which stands for Block based software transactional memory and generally involves the optimistic execution of batches of transactions meaning that they assume there are no issues with concurrent transactions and execute them all in parallel to allow for higher throughput though when conflicts are detected the affected transactions are re-executed and revalidated and finally the agreed upon set and ordering of transactions is reflected in the final blockchain State Suite on the other hand uses a dag or directed acyclic graph based mempool to facilitate parallel transactions and does not require all transactions to be ordered sequentially so for instance for simple independent transactions like sending an nft which would only affect a single owner sui uses parallel execution which can even bypass consensus for faster processing consensus is only needed for more complex transactions with dependencies that affect objects owned by multiple addresses like swapping tokens from shared liquidity pools and D5 protocols as a result of their respective architectures optos claims to be capable of handling over 160k TPS while Suite claims up to 300 ktps however these are made to be proven with optos registering a peak TPS of just over 1200 in the last 30 days and sweet a peak of 1007 TPS over the same period let's now look at some ecosystem metrics starting with the total value blocked Aptos which was launched seven months prior to sui has about 44 million in tvl compared to suis 12 million both being rather low compared to Leading chains as for the number of projects on each ecosystem move market cap lists over 150 projects on optos and about 80 on Suite spanning infrastructure D5 nfts and more however low activity count and tvl still indicate that there is low usage of these chains what about their tokonomics the total supply of swedes native asset Suite is capped at 10 billion with 50 of these tokens allocated to the community 20 to early contributors 14 to investors 10 to mist and Labs Treasury and the remaining six percent Community Access program and app testers Suite released only about five percent of its total Supply at mainnet launch and the rest will follow a release schedule that extends till 2030 though a massive unlock will happen later this year in November and may next year Aptos on the other hand had an initial total supply of 1 billion apt tokens at mainnet launch apt does not not have a maximum cap as staking rewards will increase the total supply of the token as time goes by that said 51 of the initial Supply was allocated to the community seventy percent to the Aptos Foundation 19 to core contributors and the remaining 13 to investors both projects have faced significant backlash over its subpar tokenomics with Suite only having a low amount of tokens circulating and massive unlocks scheduled and Aptos due to the fact that half of the token Supply is allocated to investors while these tokens are subject to four-year lock-up schedules the majority are being staked and staking rewards earned from them are not locked you can learn more about the tokenomics of Suite Aptos and many other projects on our website before we end the video it's worth mentioning that there are other errors of DMS such as linera which is still in its early stages of development similar to Aptos and Suite linera is founded by an ex-meta employee and is backed by top VCS the project completed a 6 million seed round in June 2022 led by Andreessen Horowitz with the participation of Sydney Capital Kemah Ventures and tribe Capital well what do you think well Aptos and Swede deliver on their lofty Ambitions and give the incumbents a run for them money or will it be the other meta spin-offs that take the throne well let us know in the comments below if you're interested in diving deeper into either Aptos or sui we've got a bunch of videos on them on our channel so make sure to check out those

Q2loIFVgl_o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2loIFVgl_o,since the calendar has flipped to the second half of the year we thought it'd be nice to look at the top gainers of the year so far just so this list isn't filled with every other meme coin that pumped last Tuesday we only included coins from within the top 50 buying market cap let's kick things off starting at number 12 with xrp the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple ecosystem which saw a 40 return in the first half of this year Ripple was created in 2012 by Ripple Labs with an aim to facilitate International money transfers using xrp as the bridge currency Ripple saw most of its gains in March which was likely influenced by a positive development on Ripple's ongoing lawsuit with the SEC next up we have Stellar which ended the first half of the year with a 44 increase seller is another project focused on facilitating fast and cost effective payments created in 2014 by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb the project uses its native cryptocurrency lumens AKA xlm as a bridge currency within the Stellar Network similar to Ripple's xrp number 10 we have Phantom a layer 1 blockchain Project known for its association with prolific developer Andre granier and Halloween themed daps launched in 2019 Phantom like its peers aims to address scalability challenges and uses its native token FTM for gas staking and governance starting the year at 0.20 FTM swiftly reached its yearly high of 0.63 on February 4th likely driven by Phantom's announcement of its 2023 road map with Andre himself at the helm by the end of June though fdm was trading at 0.30 experiencing a decline of nearly 50 percent from its yearly High nevertheless it still maintained a 50 increase since the beginning of the year at 9th place we have none other than ethereum the second largest cryptocurrency and the most popular smart contract platform starting the year at 1197 eats price followed the General market Trend surging to 1607 by the end of February a significant milestone for the network came on April 12th with the introduction of the chappella upgrade which enabled withdrawals of staked eth among other things at the end of June eth traded at 1853 registering a 55 price increase in six months moving on to the eighth spot we have okb with a 67 gain an exchange token that serves as the utility token for the okx ecosystem and allows its users to receive trading fee discounts on the okx exchange okb's prize has been Gathering momentum since last year particularly when rival exchange FTX collapse last November at the start of 2023 okb was trading at 26 its upward rally continued until it recorded a new all-time high of 58 dollars but has dropped slightly since then continuing our countdown at number seven we have Solana a layered one that made its debut in 2017 aiming to provide Lightning Fast transaction speeds and low fees it's native coin Seoul is used for gas fees and staking Solana was one of the hardest hit projects when FTX collapsed last year with its price Falling by almost 95 percent in 2022. however at the beginning of the year Seoul saw a strong recovery from 9.96 to 24.30 in just two weeks perhaps courtesy of excitement surrounding air drops of solana-based meme tokens like Bonk and Frank and Chile Seoul has however gradually trended down throughout the rest of the first half of the year and traded at 18 on June 30th which still marks an 81 percent increase since the start of the year at number six we have the graph a project created in 2018 to help index and organize data from different blockchains so that it can be easily searched and accessed by developers it's native cryptocurrency GRT is used to pay for transactions and as an incentive for Network participants to help maintain and provide reliable data the graph has seen some continued adoption and at the start of the Year GRT he was trading at six cents but in just over a month had its price more than triple to hit its yearly high of 21 cents it has since returned most of its gains to end the first half of 2023 with an 84 increase coming in at number five we have Bitcoin which needs no introduction after a rocky 2022 BTC has had a strong first half of the year and is up 84 and recently reached its yearly high at 30 694. its early year rally may have been driven by macro economic factors such as the slowing down of inflation which may have instilled some optimism in investors and let them to seek out riskier assets the FED also paused rate hikes in June while BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF spurring other Trad five giants such as Fidelity and more to follow suit aside from that Bitcoin has also outperformed the overall crypto Market indicating a rotate Asian capital from smaller riskier cryptos into Bitcoin now at number four we have ldo Lido finances governance token Lido entered the scene in 2020 as the first provider of liquid staking allowing users to stake their eth and receive one-to-one pegged sdeath tokens in return in the first quarter of the Year ldo propelled over three times to reach a yearly high of 3.27 on the back of the hyped LSD narrative the overall bullish market and its own protocol developments however it has also since trended down to end the first half of 2023 at 1.83 a 98 price increase moving into the top three gainers that have more than doubled their values in six months we start with Aptos a new layer 1 and one of the successors of meta's now shelved crypto project DM which has received its fair share of both hype and criticism apto's native token apt reached an all-time high of 18. and 42 cents like many other alts is Rally coincided with Bitcoins at the start of the Year apt has since declined to end the first half of the year at 7.15 up by 107 in six months but also down almost 70 percent from its yearly high as of the end of June as the runner-up we have Bitcoin cash one of bitcoin's hard Forks Bitcoin cash was created within the aim of addressing its perceived scalability limitations of the original Bitcoin Network bch its native token was trading sideways with minimal fluctuations throughout the year but its price spiked starting June 20th when edx markets a cryptocurrency exchange backed by trade fine leaders Citadel Fidelity and Charles Schwab announced its launch with bch being one of the only four coins available for trading on the platform bch skyrocketed to its yearly high of 254 dollars resulting in a 162 percent price increase since January and finally the number one gainer in the first half of the year is stocks the project is a Bitcoin side chain working towards bringing smart contracts and decentralized applications to the Bitcoin Network the native token of stacks STX has experienced significant growth this year due to various factors such as the announcement of a 165 million fund by crypto exchange OK coin in collaboration with stocks aimed at developing web3 projects on the Bitcoin Network another likely contributing factor to The coin's Surge was the growth of bitcoin's ecosystem largely driven by the rise of ordinals the buzz surrounding ordinals likely played a role in the rally of sdx resulting in a 225 price change in just six months though note that it is down just over 40 percent since its yearly high in mid-march as well well that was all for this video

vIWwCs39yis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIWwCs39yis,although the crypto markets weren't all that fun in 2022 several game five projects have continued to build out their products to keep the fun going for the community from RPGs first person shooters to sandbox type games we'll take a look at the top blockchain games that you should keep an eye on this year the beacon is an action role-playing game arpg built on arbitrim in its current Early Access State Beacon looks like it could shape up to be the classic definition of a free-to-play nft game the gameplay is quite Limited at the moment albeit smooth as X you can currently visit three sections to your home which is empty but which you can furnish via the marketplace The Tavern and a cave guarded by soldiers you can run through the Early Access within five minutes sure it's just a taste of things to come but if the studio can deliver this game will be one to watch if you want to give it a spin head over to thebeacon.gg connect your wallet and sign in then click on play on the top right delicium is a thing of beauty a first person shooter open world game being built on a mutable X we highly recommend checking out delysium's white paper which plays like a game and is one of if not the most unique white papers we've come across along with a shiny AAA trailers the game looks heavily inspired by cyberpunk 2077. unfortunately you have to pay a steep 1 000 usdt for a pass to test out the game so you might opt for getting a sneak peek from the pre-alpha Highlight gameplay reel instead which is admittedly awesome while we can't be sure if it's representative of the actual gameplay without testing it out ourselves one positive clue is that Gamers who have had access have not caused a stir and the game has generally received pretty positive reviews The Game's ecosystem does seem to be relatively complex with nft and token staking for its desk token and more regardless of the seeming complexity this games on my watch list for 2023 oath of peak is an oriental MMORPG released by Yeehaw games by bits gaming platform having launched recently on polygon the game offers a complete experience so you can play through the whole game whether on desktop or on mobile more than 20 million dollars has been invested into developing the core gameplay alone which is impressive considering it's free to play you enter the game as a spirit Bender ready to venture out into the Omni Spirit realm these spirit beasts roam these vast 3D rendered lands waiting to be captured the game is also designed to encourage interactivity with other players roughly 90 percent of all in-game items are generated by players playing through the game so the items come from Monster drops crafting Furniture capturing spirit beasts getting rewards from raids PVP and so on only a small element was made into on-chain assets like primordial spirit beasts psbs which provide players with more freedom to interact with these assets cast ways is currently in Alpha meaning the game is in its earliest stages of development despite that caveat the game's actually pretty fun to play even now you enter the f2p sandbox on a tiny raft surrounded by the ocean in an island and some other Castaways Flotsam like sticks and pieces of rope start appearing in the water as well as fish you can gather these items for free by drifting alongside them after a bit you can start to craft more advanced items like Spears and fishing rods you can purchase game character nfts rafs as nfts islands and even Treasure Chest nfts all of these items were airdropped to the most active players in early Alpha the teams just announced season 2 treasure chest on their Twitter account too Castaway looks promising and considering how fun it is in Alpha the game sets high expectations for what it could really be when it delivers star Atlas gets a quick mention though the caveat is that it has been in development since a couple of years ago and as such is still pressing on with the early GameFly model which has proven to have questionable sustainability in terms of tokenomics and playability we'll have to see if the team manages to adapt as development of the game chugs along star Atlas is being built on Solana and from the looks of their AAA trailers the art direction is incredible but the game isn't ready so you can't play it they have a few mini games but that's it still they've been doing pre-sales for ships some of which have gone on sale for over a million dollars to Gamers and investors and have raised over 40 million dollars in total from nft sales to date star Atlas will have to deliver in a major way for all this to make sense caveats aside this game is definitely one to keep an eye on we'll just have to see if they managed to deliver battlefly a strategic pde or PVP blockchain based game is another game built on arbitrim similar to The Beacon battlefly also lives within the treasure Dow ecosystem players use battleflies which as its name suggests are butterfly looking nfts that players can use to compete against each other in the Arenas of the game each battlefly has its own set of traits such as health attack power and defense that can be improved by equipping better mods these mods also come in different Rarities which allow players to create highly customized battleflies you can also stake your battlefly in the hyperdome with magic dollars the treasure Dow native currency and compete against other players in the idle strategic combat mode where you can earn in-game rewards such as magic dollars and g-fly tokens to get started you need to purchase a Genesis battlefly nft on the treasure Marketplace which has a floor price of around 20 magic dollars which translates to about 30 dollars at the time of recording Genesis battlefies are both tradable and transferable which means that powerful battleflies can be flipped for profit if these games don't

2ROKW4yu5XM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ROKW4yu5XM,what if I told you all you need to do to get free money is to look into this orb would you do it seriously World coin wants to give everyone free crypto in exchange for scanning their eyeballs which at this time 1.9 million people have signed up for wow the project has garnered serious attention and has early investors such as Andreessen Horowitz coinbase Ventures LinkedIn co-founder Reed Hoffman Solana founder Anatoly yakovenko polka dot founder Gavin wood and even the infamous SBF himself in March 2022 a funding round broad coins valuation to an eye-watering 3 billion but why are VCS pouring money into World coin and why does World coin want your eyeballs tools for Humanity the company behind worldcoin is co-founded by Alex blania and Sam Altman you might be more familiar with Sam as he is also the founder behind open AI the company behind the AI chat bot chat gbt which took the World by storm since its release in November last year the wild success of chat gbt also spawned an AI arms race between Tech Giants which probably means AI will only get even more advanced from now the rapid advancement in AI is now worrying the public as AIS are now able to Ace the SAT create increasingly convincing deep fakes and probably most concerningly remove the need for humans in the Workforce Now perhaps it's a coincidence but Sam has a solution for the identity problem as well as for aiding people whose jobs are taken by AI World coin in a world set to be increasingly impacted by AI World coin purportedly aims to provide individuals a way to vary verify personhood as well as access to Universal basic income to achieve this worldcoin is attempting to create a global digital identity and financial network using blockchain technology worldcoin is currently testing its smart contract on the polygon network but is in collaboration with ethereum layer 2 optimism to build on and migrate to its Network the team launched World app in May a non-custodial wallet which enables its users to transact with the world coin token and a few other cryptos as well as interact with dapps on the ethereum ecosystem however the key feature of World app is enabling World ID according to World coin World ID is a global digital password that allows users to prove their identity while preserving their private information through the use of cryptography and zero knowledge proofs World ID can establish proof of personhood meaning to prove that someone is a real unique human proof of personhood could be useful to prevent the spread of misinformation by realistic AI generated content as well as limiting civil attacks which are basically online attacks where a single attacker assumes multiple fake identities to gain influence over a network as World ID gets more adoption it's meant to be used as a method to sign into websites mobile apps and crypto dapps performing actions such as voting endows or even government elections as well as receiving aid from ngos and government programs as of now to obtain a verified World ID users are required to gaze into the infamous orb the orb will perform an iris scan and a machine learning algorithm within the orb will ensure that the eyeballs scanned are indeed real human irises and not something else like colored contact lenses or a dog then the iris scans will be converted to a hash code or as worldcoin calls it Iris half as soon as the code is generated the orbs supposedly deletes any images from the scan within the orb the iris hash is encrypted with a private key before being uploaded on chain and cross-checked with the existing catalogs of Iris hashes if the iris hash does not match any records it will be added to the catalog when worldcoin launches each verified World ID owner will then be eligible to claim their one-time airdrop of wld tokens many have asked why World ID needs Iris scans for proof of personhood supposedly it's because the human Iris has a very high degree of Randomness making it a much more effective biometric than faces or fingerprints to differentiate between billions of individuals and establish proof of personhood unsurprisingly worldcoin's decision to create a global digital identity network using Iris scans has raised a lot of eyebrows understandably so due to its uncanny similarity into what you'd see in a Black Mirror episode just as World coin was introduced back in October 2021 NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden slammed the use of Iris scans although worldcoin has promised that the iris scans will not be saved Snowden pointed out that the hash codes produced by these scans are still saved and would match future scans and that the use of ZK proofs doesn't justify the use of Biometrics for anti-fraud there's also pushback from the crypto Community some argue that the ability to use multiple accounts in web 3 for privacy is a feature not a flaw and though most agree that web3 is in need of protection against civil attacks it is not necessary to have 100 civil resistance as long as there is a method that can prevent a large enough percentage of sybils also MIT technology review released a damning report last year against World coin on the revelations upon investigating World coins field testing my much of its early field testing is conducted in poor developing countries such as Indonesia Sudan and Kenya where data privacy regulations are weaker and whose communities were the most financially impacted by the pandemic the lengthy report revealed that orb operators were giving limited information during recruitment other than being aware that their payment is based on the number of signups they achieve operators employed strategies such as hosting giveaways of cash and airpods and try to encourage people to sign up while providing little information on world coins campaign on top of that worldcoin claimed that only an iris scan is needed for signups however orb operators also asked for their email addresses and phone numbers which a world coin representative denied as part of the data collection practice a black market for verified Iris scans has even popped up in China where the world Coin App isn't supposed to be available though the world coin team is attempting to contain the issue also the project was found to have made contradictory claims of compliance with EU data regulations and was accused of lacking transparency in its data collection practices it seems that world coin is neck deep in controversies but the project just received another 115 million in a series C funding round just last month onboarding billions of people to create a global digital identity and financial Network to distribute Universal basic income is a tall order with the backlash it's getting from its field testing and many wondering if worldcoin is simply a cover for Mass data collection it remains to be seen whether worldcoin can deliver on their promises will worldcoin save us from Deep fakes and AIS taking our jobs or is it just trying to harvest our eyeballs well let us know in the comments and also check out this video

EmwssOE4b9I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmwssOE4b9I,the fed and macro has been widely discussed in crypto recently especially after the money printer stopped going and the FED started its monetary tightening policy after the pandemic today we will discuss the Federal Reserve aka the FED what is it what does it do and how does the FED affect crypto first let's take a quick history lesson in the Years leading up to 1907 loose monetary policy in the U.S made money and credit easy to be obtained leading to excessive speculative Investments well hit the fan when these risky Investments failed in October 1907 which triggered widespread Bank runs throughout the U.S as the public lost confidence in the banking industry this eventually became one of the largest albeit short-lived financial crisis known today as the Panic of 1907. without a central bank top Bankers notably JP Morgan stepped in and bailed out surviving Wall Street Banks and other institutions with money out of their own Pockets effectively acting as the lenders of Last Resort to the U.S economy in response to the crisis bankers and U.S government officials came together in 1910 to form the national monetary commission to research and design the framework for the Federal Reserve in 1913 team the Federal Reserve was created initially with the goal to bail out troubled Banks however it has evolved over the decades to provide more government oversight on Banks and financial institutions with the intention of creating a more stable Financial system so what is the Federal Reserve and what does it do the Federal Reserve or the FED for short is the Central Bank of the United States and is responsible for providing Financial Services to financial institutions supervising commercial Banks and contributing to monetary policy for the purposes of this video we will be focusing on the federal reserve's role in monetary policy the U.S Congress assigned the FED to conduct the nation's monetary policy to support the goals of Maximum employment and stable prices this is commonly referred to as the fed's Dual mandate price stability essentially means the FED is targeting a two percent inflation rate over the media Indian term to provide confidence for the people to spend and invest on the other hand maximum employment means achieving the highest amount of employment the economy can sustainably support this means that the FED must balance these two objectives ensuring that there are as many jobs as possible for everyone while keeping inflation low the FED tries to fulfill its dual mandate through monetary policy which simply put is a set of tools that the FED uses to manage the supply of money in the economy the branch of the FED which is responsible for setting monetary policy is the Federal Open Market Committee AKA at the fomc whose meetings and rate hike decisions are the ones you've probably been hearing about so much over the past year and a half first the fomc reviews economic data during regularly scheduled meetings and forecasts the growth of the Economy based on how the economy is doing one of the main things that the fomc decides on is the new new Target for the federal funds rate which is the interest rate Banks charge each other on overnight loans changes made to the FED funds rate have effects that eventually trickle down to the economy so these tools are more like turning the temperature knobs of an oven rather than flipping switches on or off for example if inflation is running High and the FED thinks that the economy might be overheated the FED could start raising the federal funds rate commonly known as a rate hike which leads to higher interest rates on credit cards loans and mortgages higher interest rates lead to higher costs of borrowing which causes businesses and consumers to spend less lower spending eventually leads to Falling prices and lower employment as businesses make less money now that we know in simple terms how the FED is able to move markets let's look at how the crypto Market has responded to the fed's policies the pandemic saw an unprecedented increase of the money supply with an estimated 6 trillion injected into the economy for everyone that was around during that time I'm sure you remember how Bitcoin rallied to new all-time highs along with the rest of the crypto Market however due to the massive increase of liquidity in the economy combined with supply chain disruptions caused by coveted restrictions inflation rent hot as the price of goods and services skyrocketed in 2021. in response to rapidly Rising inflation at the start of 2022 the FED started raising the FED funds rate and has done this 10 times since March 16th last year which coincided with when the crypto Market fell into a bear Market this makes sense as explained earlier higher interest rates makes money more expensive because borrowing is more costly when less money is making its way into the economy investors tend to be more careful and are less likely to pour money into risky assets such as tech stocks and you guessed it crypto inversely when interest rates are low and borrowing becomes cheaper it encourages businesses and consumers to borrow and spend more with more money in the economy and more people being employed more money tends to find itself flowing into riskier assets while this really only scratches the surface of this topic setting the FED funds rate is just one of the monetary policy tools that the FED wields but we hope that this video has helped you understand what the FED is what they do and how they can influence the crypto Market if you hear about yet another rate hike from the fomc in the near future well then you should be able to understand better what it means speaking of how the crypto markets have been doing lately with the rate hikes you can watch a video where we compared all the Bitcoin bear markets right here [Music] [Applause] thank you,Youtube video,The

kij8yUI1zVE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kij8yUI1zVE,Bitcoin dominance is a metric that measures the share of bitcoin's market cap against the market cap of all cryptocurrencies simple enough but in this video we'll explain the importance of this metric and how it can be used to navigate the market cycle just in case you needed a refresher market cap represents the total value of a coin in circulation calculated by multiplying its price with its circulating Supply meanwhile all coins refer to any crypto aside from Bitcoin Bitcoin dominance is therefore calculated by dividing Bitcoins market cap against the total crypto market cap did you know that Bitcoin has made up 38 to essentially 100 percent of the total cryptocurrency market cap since it was created over a decade ago this is impressive when you consider the tens of thousands of all coins that have sprung up since this shows that despite the claims of Bitcoin Killers out there the fact remains that Bitcoin is still the largest and most popular cryptocurrency this gives it a strong influence over the crypto Market as a whole which in general moves in lockstep with the OG orange coin but Bitcoin dominance that is the share of Bitcoin over the entire crypto Market can tell a different story on its its own so let's take a walk down memory lane looking at the Historical Bitcoin dominance chart the obvious thing you'll note is that it had fallen off a cliff around 2017. from bitcoin's birth in 2009 up till 2017 bitcoin's dominance understandably stood around 95 to 99 as there were very few all coins available it's 2017 onwards where things get interesting when the crypto landscape changed drastically with the rise of ethereum and the Ico boom it enabled investors flocked into each and every next big thing which was mushrooming on The Daily by the end of the bull run right around the end of 2018 Bitcoin dominance had fallen to an all-time low of about 38 those of you who had been around during that time will recall the brutal bear Market witch ensued many all coins went bust and most icos never materialized paired with the likelihood that some people soon decided that Bitcoin may be the safer bet after all Capital flowed back into Bitcoin resulting in Bitcoin dominance rebounding off its lows by about two times to reach about 70 percent once again by the end of August 2019. then 2020 rolled around and along with it came D5 summer in full swing with protocols offering insanely high yields investors and defy digens alike port capital back into the altcoin market bitcoin's dominance started to decline as a result and hit 40 towards the end of the year ever since then it has been ranging between 40 percent to just under 50 percent though instead of being immediately rejected from the top of the range it is hovered close to it for many weeks now at the time of shooting so it may be something worth keeping an eye on to see what it does next so then some of the factors that affect bitcoin's dominance like the Bull and Bear market so during bull runs Traders become more willing to take risks and experiment with smaller cap altcoins and hence move from established boring coin lines like Bitcoin this of course causes bitcoin's market dominance to decline in Bear markets people have probably gotten wrecked and this affects the behavior of crypto Traders which then shifts towards being more cautious and risk averse that may mean putting their money back into large safer projects like Bitcoin or exiting the market altogether bitcoin's price and dominance have varied significantly over its history and investors and analysts have looked into the tea leaves to decipher what their movements could mean especially in relation to the altcoin market and as a market sentiment gauge the general findings and observations that resulted can be summarized and simplified into this neat little Matrix of Bitcoin dominance and bitcoin price and you'll find many variations of this table out there one of the ways to use this indicator could be to identify a Bitcoin season or altcoin season for instance when bitcoin price is on a rally and its dominance is increasing along with it this means that it is Apple performing the altcoin market as a whole meanwhile if bitcoin price is heading up but its dominance is going down this means that the growth of the altcoin market is outpacing Bitcoins now of course as with most indicators these outcomes are not set in stone and act more like a guideline a more useful way to think of Bitcoin dominance might be to think in terms of where liquidity is flowing and risk for instance is capital flowing into Bitcoin all coins are out of the market altogether getting a sense of where money is Flowing May inform your decision making if capital is flowing into Bitcoin out of all coins or out of the market completely you also have to consider the risk of holding altcoins particularly during bear markets most all coins bleed not only against the dollar but are also in a long-term downtrend against Bitcoin itself while the metric is popular it has received its fair share of criticism surrounding its reliability among them being that it doesn't take into account permanently lost Bitcoin which which means its real market cap is actually lower as there is a portion of its Supply that is inaccessible the metric also doesn't account for the growing dominance of stable coins from 2019 till early 2022 the market cap of stable coins has grown exponentially from about 4 million to 151 billion this means that Traders and investors have an alternative to bitcoin when it comes to seeking safety and stability or when entering the market or taking profits this dilutes Bitcoin share of the market and can notably affect the Bitcoin dominance metric as with all indicators and signals it's not wise to rely solely on one to determine your trading strategy instead combine it with other indicators to better identify market trends so now that you've learned about Bitcoin dominance and its history how about check out a comparison of its previous bear markets instead we've got you covered with a video on that right here [Music] thank you,Youtube video,Bitcoin Dominance: Why You NEED to Understand This Metric,2023-06-29 00:00:00,388.0,CoinGecko

CEO and previously director of r d Ed Novi financial and director of engineering at Facebook adeni abioden CPO and ex-product lead for Novi Sam Blackshear CTO and ex-principal engineer at Novi Financial George Denise's Chief scientist and ex-research scientist of the Novi team and Costa's chalkiest Chief cryptographer and ex-league cryptographer Ed meta phew so those are some stacked credentials so what is sweet sweet is a layer one smart contract platform like the many other layer ones that are out there albeit with some unique features which we'll get into in a bit it runs on a delegated proof-of-stake system and has a rotating set of about 100 validators which is selected from a current total of about 400 plus nodes distributed globally this is pretty centralized compared to chains like Bitcoin or ethereum validators also need to put up a minimum staking pool size of 30 million Suite that's not exactly chump change wow that's a lot of money the sweet blockchain is built using the sweet move programming language which is their own modified version of move move itself is a platform agnostic open source programming language based on Rust which was originally developed at Facebook for building the now abandoned DM blockchain without getting too deep in the weeds move is supposed to be a safer and more expressive language than common blockchain languages today like solidity and smart contract vulnerabilities which allow exploits like duplication double spending or accidental destruction are inherently prevented by the way move is designed Aptos is also programmed with move while other chains like Solana and near are coded in rest so these could be seen as competition to suite at least in terms of developers Swiss data model in regards to how assets are owned is also unique compared to the EVMS which is what's widely used by many layer ones currently Suite is asset or object based rather than contract based Suite also introduces concepts of owned versus shared objects which allows for more efficient transaction processing which is in contrast to most other chains which essentially only have shared objects for example with the evm approach when Alice buys token X what's happening is she sends a transaction to the Token smart contract however token X does not actually become owned by Alice rather the smart contract simply updates its internal records to state that Alice now owns token X therefore if Alice wants to do a simple transfer of her token X to Bob she then needs to initiate another transaction with the smart contract which will then update the ownership record of token X from Alice to Bob even though in theory Alice is supposed to own token X this is actually not the case where ownership is actually trapped with the smart contract in Suite this is different to buy token X Alice would still send a transaction to token X's smart contract but now the smart contract then actually sends token X to Alice whereby token X will then be owned by Alice therefore now if Alice wants to transfer token X to Bob she can do so directly without having to interact with the smart contract anymore owned objects are assets which are owned by a single address like Alice's token X therefore these can be directly transferred almost instantly between individuals bypassing consensus and thus uses little network resources these simple unrelated transactions can also be processed in parallel as the specific ordering is not important meanwhile transactions involving shared objects which belong to multiple addresses require more resources as they need to be sequenced and thus need validator consensus another feature which adds to sweet scalability is that Swiss distributed computing model Works something like a traditional cloud service where validators can add more processing power to the network as transaction volume increases and reduce it when no longer needed much like how Cloud providers can turn more servers on or off to cater to fluctuating loads this results in the ability for Swede to stabilize and maintain its gas fees at a low level flattening the wild Peaks and troughs of blockchains like ethereum according to their latest performance update the suite network was able to process from over 10 000 transactions to a whopping 300 000 transactions per second with a 480 millisecond time to finality however according to their block Explorer Max GPS in the past 30 days was around 1300 while current transaction processing loads only sit at 70ps as such there's a long way to go before suis Claims can be verified in practice now let's quickly look at Swiss tokenomics Suite has a total and maximum supply of 10 billion 50 is reserved for the sui Foundation or Community 20 goes to early contributors 14 to investors 10 to the Miss and Labs Treasury and six percent to the Community Access program and app testers currently only about five percent of the total Supply is circulating with massive unlocks coming later this year in November and another one in May next year so you might want to watch out for those like many other native tokens Suite is used for paying gas fees for all operations validator staking and governance the suite directory currently lists 33 projects in its ecosystem spanning D5 gaming nfts and more while there are over 1 million sui wallet downloads transaction volume is still low along with its tvl which sits at 18.6 million with just two D5 protocols making up for almost all of this value along with the current CPS count this shows that there's just not all that much activity going on at suite at the moment though of course as the market sentiment shifts an attention turns to crypto again this could change while there is no official road map from Suite the sui foundation and team is working on building out the ecosystem with various brands from developers and academic research expanding their ambassador program and improving the move developer experience to attract Builders well that wraps up our quick review of sweet tell us in the comments what you think about the project do you think it's revolutionary or do

TuGw4dtZoQw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuGw4dtZoQw,is 2023 the year of Bitcoin ordinals just a few months ago we saw how Bitcoin nfts like space Pepe and Bitcoin frogs Caked Up a vicious debate within the community many of us expected this nft fed to pass eventually but it didn't since we last covered it ordinals have shut up the charts making Bitcoin now the second largest blockchain for nft sales ahead of competitors known for their strong nft communities like Solana immutable X and polygon thanks to ordinals it seems the reign of Bitcoin is stronger than ever the number of Bitcoin nfts continues to climb at the time this video was made inscriptions are closing in on the 10 million Mark the might of ordinals was so powerful that it even spread to its cousin Network's Litecoin and Doge unleashing a frenzy of activities on them for weeks and now BRC 20 tokens are the hottest new thing in crypto town which have accounted for 41 of all Bitcoin transactions in May you heard that right even tokens are now available on bitcoin too before we peel back the onions on brc20 we need to First understand how Bitcoin inscriptions work as you already know the Bitcoin blockchain functions like a public Ledger recording all the transactions ever made on the network think of the blockchain as a long chain of connected blocks with each block containing a list of transactions each transaction is like a digital receipt that shows who sent Bitcoins to whom and how many ordinals assign a unique number or index to each of these transactions based on the order in which they were included in a block kind of like the page numbers in a book this way we can refer to a specific transaction by its ordinal number and easily find it within the blockchain now let's talk about the inscription part inscription here is made possible by Bitcoin ordinals which refers to adding data Like Love Letters silly frog images funny videos or any other file format that you can think of to a Satoshi earlier this year in March a developer that goes by the name of Domo data started wondering what if we inscribe Json to satoshi's is it possible for us to create a fungible token standard for Bitcoin then just like erc20 for ethereum this wandering turned into theories theories turned into experiments experiments into reality finally giving birth to the star of this video today brc20 by attaching Json to satoshi's we can now Define every characteristic brc20 token like minting and Supply using codes just like any other tokens that we're so familiar with brc20 tokens Can Be minted and spent once deployed any Bitcoin ordinals wallet can connect to the network and mint the token but watch out because there is a limit to each mint the first of such tokens was of course the thing that made all of these possible in the first place ordinals or ordi since its launch ordi has gained significant traction becoming the largest brc20 token by market cap with over 200 million and of course in typical crypto fashion other tokens that have gained broad visibility include tokens with names like meme Pisa and pepe okay so now that you've seen what sort of b or C20 tokens are available the question is how can you get your hands on them well the easy way would be to buy these tokens from centralized exchanges such as gate and okx the alternative is to get them from the ordinals exchange on ordinalswallet.com this is where you'll be able to create a wallet to store all of your precious BRC 20 tokens but more than that it's also the place where you can mint and trade Bitcoin tokens and nfts to do so simply click brc20 from the top menu then click on any tokens from the list to see available still requests when you're ready click buy now to purchase the token directly from your wallet other decentralized markets for brc20 include trustless market and biso swap the latter actually being uniswap smart contracts deployed onto the Bitcoin Network most of these tokens are coin tokens at the moment but at the beginning of uniswap was any indication back in defy summer this is the first of many steps for more sophisticated D5 applications to come Bitcoin was initially envisioned as a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system with brc20 tokens more use cases are now unlocked first the basic stuff just like any other tokens like Ave and R brc20 can be freely transferred between peers as digital cache and potentially use for payments on Commercial platforms brc20 tokens also have the potential to Kickstart a vibrant defy economy like we've seen on ethereum including decentralized exchanges lending platforms Structured Products yield Farms decentralized governance and many many more to take things one step further brc20 tokens can also be tokenized to represent real-world assets which can help increase the transparency and security of existing processes and easily enable on-chain fractional ownership which can lead to increased liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets like real estate on the positive side brc20 tokens offer several upsides including fungibility security and compatibility within the Bitcoin Network however it's important to note that brc20 is not evm compatible which means developers May face limitations in accessing certain resources and building on the network this lack of evm compatibility could potentially result in a smaller ecosystem and limited adoption compared to other networks thanks ordinals miners are now earning more thanks to the increase in network activities Bitcoin adoption is rising but the flip side of this also means more stress to the Bitcoin blockchain resulting in higher gas fees regardless of where you stand when it comes to ordinals you have to Marvel at kryptos continuous innovation so is this just a fad that will pass soon or will Bitcoin defy and nfts truly pose a challenge in ethereum's domain while this remains to be seen But no matter what folks always remember to dyor and a responsibly if you want to learn more about ordinals well then check out our brc20 category page on coin gecko or our previous video about Bitcoin nfts right here foreign

ZL1bysb2MV0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL1bysb2MV0,think back to the days of Economics 101 remember how the professor was always emphasizing on demand Supply demand Supply and how these are the ultimate governing forces of the one thing most of us in crypto care most about price now while it's not always easy to predict the demand for a particular coin most of the time there's a clear-cut way to predict the exact number of coins there will be at any point in time as long as you know where to look when you're trying to evaluate the value of a coin it's not enough to just look at the price for instance a coin with 90 of its Supply scheduled to be released tomorrow most likely wouldn't be a very good buy now no matter how low its current price is the good thing is projects will usually tell you exactly when and what will happen to their token Supply you can usually find this in the tokenomic section of their docs or white paper in this section it's common to come across words like emission Cliff vesting unlocks Etc but what do they mean okay so first the term emission or emission rate refers to how often new coins are minted or created for instance eat emission after the merge is roughly 1700 East per day on busy days when the burn rate is high which is the speed at which coins are removed from the supply the opposite of emission eth can even be deflationary a coin which is deflationary will see its Supply dropping over time in all else being equal this should have a positive impact on its price it's important to pay attention to the emission rate as you wouldn't want to invest in a coin that is hyperinflationary or as the experts would like to put it money printer go another main highlight of tokenomics is the unlock schedule so when a project raises funds through a token sale the tokens sold to the early investors and allocated to team members are usually locked or vested so locked tokens means that they're not immediately released and instead there will be numerous intervals in which they are unlocked and then distributed to these holders so this helps to ensure that the interests of these members and investors are all aligned towards the betterment of the project because imagine having a large portion of your Investments locked with a project you'd be much more motivated to make sure that the project does well right now when it comes to unlocks there are usually two portions Cliff investing so Cliff refers to a period of time that must pass before the release of the tokens begins best thing on the other hand is the process by which assets are released over a period of time so we say that your tokens are locked with a three-month cliff and one year monthly linear vesting which means that your tokens will only start to unlock after three months after which they will be released to you every month within the span of one year for certain coins you can also track their unlocked schedules by looking at their token unlock Page by hovering your cursor over circulating Supply you can also see some of the Project's vesting wallets again it's important to know how the emission and unlock schedule of a coin looks before throwing your entire net worth into it these things give you a glimpse into future Supply changes and lets you estimate how much selling pressure there will be but while it makes logical sense that Supply increases price decreases the real crypto world is a little bit more complicated than that in certain cases some unlocks can even be seen as bullish unlocks which can cause the price to soar instead so how in the world does this happen Okay so picture this this guy right here let's call him Adam invested in the private sale of a D5 project at the price of one cent his tokens are locked for one year but two months in the token is already trading at a price of one dollar now Adam here he's already pretty happy with his returns in fact he'd be more than happy if he could just sell his lock tokens for just 80 cents so he goes to his friend Judy who's willing to buy Adam's lock tokens for 80 cents they get some of their lawyer friends in to draft out agreements and whatnots so that Adam will be contractually obligated to transfer these lock tokens Mr Judy once they're unlocked and all of a sudden for a price of 80 cents Judy is now the new owner of these tokens imagine this happens a couple more times with more and more duties taken over the ownership of lock tokens and come on Lifetime if the token is trading close to 80 cents then it's likely that the cell pressure will not happen since the duties are rather the new owners of the lock tokens won't want to sell on the open market for such a low return this can also be a positive outlook for the market in general since the atoms with weak hands have sold to investors with the conviction to buy lock tokens the duties of the world a similar effect to this would be well-known Diamond hand investors or investors with a long time Horizon buying up locked tokens in short crypto valuations can be a tricky Affair and although looking at their tokonomic and Supply changes can go a long way in helping you make better investment decisions there are many other factors that need to be considered too such as demand for the coin and whether it has any utility or product Market fit how is the Project's value relative to its competitors does it have any potential to catch up or is it already overvalued well you can learn more about tokenomics by checking out our previous video right here and also remember

-bYXx0IK138,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bYXx0IK138,in this video we have compiled a list of some of the worst mistakes to avoid in crypto now some might seem a little too obvious but most not so much so watch the whole video to find out [Music] mistake number one falling victim to your own emotions in the crypto World emotion and High play a big role in investors decisions for example acting out of fomo say Mary is hyped up by her friend to buy into a coin that has been blowing up or maybe she encounters a rags to riches story from a YouTuber who perfectly timed the bottom and top of coin X since Mary doesn't want to miss out she makes investment decisions solely out of fomo remember hearing somebody else's success story is not an investment pieces tip on top of doing your research have a plan for your Investments this will help you block out the outside noise and make informed investment decisions mistake number two sending your cryptocurrency to the wrong wallet the thought of sending Bitcoin to the wrong address can be scary even for crypto veterans that said the most common mistakes are often the easiest to avoid you could be sending crypto from an exchange wallet to another digital wallet or even sending crypto to a friend only to mistype the wallet address when this happens the crypto is sent to an erroneous wallet address and in most cases it's unrecoverable tip instead of typing out the address copy and paste the address into the recipient field once you are ready to send cross check the address and then check it again another good practice is to send out a test amount like ten dollars first before the actual full amount moving on to mistake number three ignoring fees new investors might jump into purchasing crypto without understanding how the fees work on exchanges for example while making crypto purchases with a credit card is simple and instant it incurs higher transaction fees now learning and paying attention to fees might feel insignificant in the short term but it can save you a lot of money in the long term gas fees on networks like ethereum are calculated based on network congestion and hence can turn a simple inexpensive transaction into a costly Nightmare and the worst case scenario being the gas costing more than the value of the transaction itself here's a tip to avoid paying overly excessive gas fees find a time when gas is relatively Low by checking sites like etherscan next up mistake for keeping your crypto wealth in hot wallets or exchanges always remember the saying not your keys not your coins even if it might seem like you actually own the coins on your exchange account you are not in total control of them that said moving your crypto to a hot wallet may not be enough security wise hot wallets they're always online and connected to the blockchain so they are more prone to vulnerabilities and hackers can drain your wallet through crypto scams or hacks now cold wallets are less convenient but reduce the risk of getting hacked tip consider storing the majority of your crypto and Hardware wallets instead of on an exchange unless you plan to actively Trade It next up is giving out your seed phrase and getting scammed the current crypto environment is littered with Bad actors looking to steal your hard-earned money and social media platforms have proven to be a hot bet for them now unfortunately efforts from the platforms have not been enough to root them out since they are still at large so it is your responsibility to stay safe and Vigilant scam artists are getting more creative by the day for instance you can be scammed into entering your seed phrase into a side that you think is legitimate and secure but it is actually a duplicate fishing landing page always remember that the seed phrase effectively affords the same opportunities to drain your savings as the private key so protected just as much tip never reveal your seed phrase to anyone never ever don't do it enter it only to recover Acts access to your wallet now mistake 6 is especially relevant for new crypto investors that is trading using leverage in crypto trading leverage increases your purchasing power allowing you to trade with more money than you actually have even up to 100 times your account balance this means that your profits are multiplied however if a trade goes poorly leverage works against you and can multiply your losses as well now new crypto investors would do better to avoid trading with leverage or attempting any other sophisticated techniques and doing so only after gaining sufficient experience moving on to mistake 7 short-term thinking many new investors may fall into the Trap of getting into crypto to get rich quick and of course there is a possibility of making massive gains however there's also a possibility of losing all your funds to a bad investment move now depending on your financial goals consider having a mindset shift this way you will choose your crypto Investments more carefully and concentrate on picking higher quality projects with long track records tip having a long-term investment plan may help you to stay convicted especially when the prices fall dramatically mistake number eight is failing to diversify your portfolio as they say don't put all your eggs in one basket you should consider spreading your money out among different digital currencies this means you don't take risk being Overexposed should one of them plummet in value especially since the market prices of digital assets are highly volatile so just do your research on the many projects out there and hand pick the quality ones you believe have a high potential now on to the second last mistake investing more than you can afford to lose most people out there will give trading tips however they might not have your best interests at heart plus everyone has different financial goals and different amounts of risk that they are willing to stomach don't forget that crypto is a high risk asset and many Traders are already losing money so don't let anyone trick you with Surefire trading methods for guaranteed profits here's my tip set limits on how much you invest in a particular digital currency and do not be tempted to trade with more money than you can afford to lose last but not least not doing your own research dyor a word that you will hear a lot in the world of crypto and for a good reason there are so many people and even projects in crypto that are not genuine therefore it is your responsibility to go out of your way and Carry Out proper research on projects before choosing to invest so here's my tip watch this helpful guide on doing your own research and find out what other investors are doing to make informed investment decisions and also be sure to let us know in the comments if you have made any of these mistakes [Music] foreign [Music],Youtube video,Crypto MISTAKES I Wish I Knew Before

EIt8GsEBzZw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIt8GsEBzZw,Bitcoin is bad for the environment bad for the environment but it's also affecting the environment Bitcoin is bad for the environment if I got a dollar for every time I've heard that well maybe I'd have a Bitcoin by now if you've caught or earlier video on whether Bitcoin is a climate disaster you may already know that Bitcoin mining is not as it seems in mainstream media well recently varunga has become the first national park to run a Bitcoin line all with renewable energy in order to continue funding efforts to protect its forest and world-renowned Wildlife if you're a nature or Netflix documentary buff you may have heard of the varunga national park in Congo from a documentary produced by Leonardo Dicaprio and it aired close to a decade ago the oscar-nominated film followed the story of several incredibly Brave Park Rangers who are grappling with not only a rebel Invasion but the overlooming threat of Big Oil all to protect the park and its endangered mountain gorillas for those who haven't watched the film what you need to understand is that varunga resides in a volatile region filled with violent conflict and Corruption varunga and the broader region continues to experience heavy deforestation up till today due to its Rich soils which make agricultural exploitation all too common as well as other resources like charcoal and rare or Precious Minerals this is a problem because the Congo rainforest happens to be the second largest rainforest after the Amazon and is not only incredibly biodiverse and home to iconic Wildlife but also provides invaluable environmental services for the planet unfortunately the previous few years have been tough for varunga from the 2018 Rebel kidnappings to the Ebola outbreak in 2019 and then two years of covet lockdowns from 2020 onwards tourism which makes up 40 percent of Park revenue had been grinded to a standstill for four years all these plus the fact that the Congolese government only subsidizes about one percent of the Park's operating budget have left varunga in a dire State and in desperate need for money it's not surprising then that just late last year Congo's government announced its plan to auction oil leases in the country many of which are located around the park and some even within the borders of the park itself in the words of park director damroad varunga would have gone bust as a national park if not for Bitcoin mining according to maroad Bitcoin mining was a happy accident for varunga you see as part of wider plans to sustainably manage and Harness Park resources there are plans to build a network of hydropower plants and to have electricity buyers and sellers grow gradually however there were two problems first plants have to be built first before buyers could slowly come in and in the meantime those plants would face the issue of being uneconomical as they would initially not only require upfront Capital but will also be generating Excess power due to the lack of buyers two was that one of the plants did not have enough Capital to finish construction to even turn the plant on well this is where Bitcoin mining comes into the picture that much needed electricity buyer and Dima Road and colleagues landed on the idea of purchasing 2 hundred thousand dollars worth of bitcoin miners in the words of dimmer Road it dawned on us that this was an extraordinary solution as this could potentially earn both short and long-term profits while being a viable way to profitably use excess hydropower the idea was brought to life with the help of crypto investor Sebastian guspilu and the parks mining operation started in September 2020 when most of the world was still under pandemic lockdowns now 10 shipping containers each holding 250 to 500 Asic miners sit in the varunga National Park of which varunga owns three and goosebulu the rest brunga's three containers of miners have all Bitcoin profits channeled towards its operational costs while this video pays lunga for its cheap hydropower to power the other seven and keeps the Bitcoin mind for him and his investors so far the Bitcoin Mine by varunga is immediately sold to fund operations including paying for Park salaries and infrastructure like rose and water pumping stations the park also finally hit a stroke of luck because the time that they started coincided with when Bitcoin was just about to go on a major bull run when the price of each Bitcoin sat at about 44 000 the maroad estimated that the miners generated around 150 000 a month which is close to what tourism had provided at its peak in total in 2022 the estimated profit from the mine was five hundred thousand dollars which was crucial money when covet lockdowns had shut down pretty much all other sources of revenue of course this often raises the question of whether Bitcoins created price makes the operation financially sustainable to this demure Road points out that every day of mining is pure profit no matter what the price of Bitcoin is as electricity is free for them turns out it's pretty difficult to be in the red when what you're doing is generating Bitcoin out of surplus energy that would otherwise have no value it's a big difference from investors buying Bitcoin to speculate on its price however Bitcoin mining here is not without its challenges what with the sub-optimal weather presence of Rebel militia and unstable internet connection so by no means is mining Bitcoin here a walk in the park also even though varunga's mining operation is in the green as long as bitcoin's price is not zero it is still negatively impacted by the industry as a whole due to the bad Optics from fiascos like the FDX or Terra meltdown and just the general stubborn perception of kryptos supposed outsized environmental impacts and so this may reduce the willingness of other investors to fund the park as with most things the answer is not black and white and we're not trying to paint the picture that Bitcoin mining is the Silver Bullet solution to all our problems but important stories like these highlight the other side of the picture and goes a long way in dismantling the stigma around mining as the road emphasizes crypto isn't the sole answer to save the varunga park but only a part of a larger eco-business model and of course importantly it's not just about the wildlife but it's about sustainably supporting the millions of people who live in and around the park so if you're interested in more positive crypto stories check out our video on

eEYHkbl3iCA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEYHkbl3iCA,are you on the hunt for the Holy Grail of crypto tired of all the ridiculous gas fees on ethereum do you like the sound of air drops we've got just the right chain for you here High throughput per second transactions faster than you can say holy moly affordable gas fees all the good things about ethereum decentralization transparency security all packaged into this neat permissionless layer 2 protocol called starknet starknet is the brainchild of starkware a blockchain technology company focused on scaling blockchains using ZK Stark technology unlike its fellow ZK roll-up competitors like ZK sync and scroll starknet employs a unique cryptography method called Stark the parents company stockware is also behind the protocol called Stark X which is a permissioned L2 solution designed to fit the needs of specific daps such as dydx immutable X and even so rare for NFD minting and trading and of course just like any other good all chains without a coin rumors of a starknet airdropper already running rampant in the crypto space except this time the rumors are true how true well for starters the Stark net tokens Stark have already been deployed on the ethereum mainnet however the tokens are not up for sale yet as the team is still trying to fine-tune the distribution process now that the starknet alpha mainnet is finally live coupled with its recent 282.5 million Rays at a jaw-dropping valuation of 8 billion dollars the question aside from when is how although we can't quite know for sure what the exact criteria are like other airdrops there's a standard Playbook that we can use to maximize our chances so let's get right to it fellow airdrop Hunters you should know this by now the best chance to receive Stark like any other airdrops is to interact with their test net and what's the first thing that everyone needs when you're in crypto no not this guy this one Argent X is the first and most popular wallet on starknet with over 500 000 users and well-known investors such as Paradigm index Ventures and stockware Labs it's as good a place as any to get started on your Stark net Journey Argent also started running a campaign called starknet Explorer sometime last month it features eight nft drops across eight weeks so should still be running by the time this video hits the tube to qualify users will need to own an Argent X wallet first and foremost you would then need to perform a series of actions and examples from previous weeks include something as simple as making a transaction on starknet to playing a retro Fighter game to follow up on the exact requirements for the nft drops make sure you follow Argent on Twitter Argin X can be downloaded as an extension for both Chrome or Firefox if you want to test out multiple wallets Bravos is the other option for exploring the starknet ecosystem with they also recently started a stark net Journey giveaway campaign though it's uncertain how long they'll be running it for so check out their Twitter for more updates once you have your wallet set up it's time to get some funds into it to do this we recommend using start gate which is the official Bridge built and deployed by the stockware team simply connect your wallet and transfer some eth uscc usdt die or wbtc from ethereum to starknet remember frequency of use can be important here when it comes to qualifying so make sure you stay diligent in bridging both in and out Stark net here to fully count every grounds repeat the same actions across another Bridge called Orbiter 2. now that we've gotten the boring stuff out of the way it's time to start interacting with some daps the best part about this is that not only could you increase your chances of getting an airdrop from the ecosystem but the protocols themselves might also run an airdrop of their own in the future to start let's keep things simple and hop onto 10K swap a decentralized exchange forked from everyone's favorite uniswap in order to maximize your chances you should provide liquidity to some of the pools and make sure to perform token swaps regularly next up is ZK lend a decentralized money market built for the starknet ecosystem similar to dapps like Ave or compound you should go through the whole process of lending and borrowing here the great news is that zklind is also their own airdrop soon so this may just be our best chance to kill two birds with one stone now on to the nft side of things mint Square mins square is an nft platform that supports both zksync and star argument here you should try to Mint an nft simply upload a picture give it a name some attributes click mint and voila you have yourself a shiny new nft just make sure that starknet is selected as the network here well that wraps it up for this video do keep in mind that what's shown here is only a tiny part of the entire starknet ecosystem if you really want to max out your chances for the airdrop make sure that you interact with as many dapps as frequently as possible you can visit the starknet ecosystem website for a full rundown of all the available protocols if you can't get enough of airdrops well then check out our playlist on them right here thank you,Youtube video,Starknet Potential AIRDROP??

-LRefVCiEUU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LRefVCiEUU,layer 0 just closed a funding round in early April raising 120 million at a 3 billion valuation and you know what that means a growing speculation of an incoming airdrop well buckle up as we get you up to speed with Leia Zero's technology and ecosystem plus how to increase your chances of being eligible for a potential air drop what is layer zero and what does it do well simply put layer 0 is one of the projects trying to solve interoperability issues in blockchain technology we can all agree that blockchains can be useful however they're not very good at talking to one another for example two adapts built on ethereum can interact with each other but when it comes to communication between different chains it can be a little tricky this means that blockchain ecosystems exist as Islands cut off from other chains unless a bridge is built and we all know how that has gone layer 0 attempts to bypass the typical bridging method and is instead attempting to build the foundational communication infrastructure for the entire blockchain ecosystem well that's quite the ambition huh well layer Zero's lofty Ambitions are being backed by some of the largest names in the space with 293 million raised in funding over eight rounds featuring high profile backers such as Sequoia a16z coinbase Ventures and finance abs without getting too technical it uses what it calls an ultra light node for layers and oracles to transfer information across chains a set of smart contracts known as endpoints link the chains together and that all of layer 0's supported chains have these endpoints which can additionally be deployed on other chains to add them to layer zeros Network let's take this simple transaction to see how these components work together say you want to send information from chain a to chain B this could be a cross chain token swap a cross chain nft transaction or even a cross chain vote once you initiate the transaction its details will be sent to the layer 0 and point on chain a this endpoint sends the transaction details to the Oracle and relayer which notify chain B that you want to make a transaction the Oracle is responsible for sending a summary of the latest transactions on chain a to chain B while the relayer submits proof to chain B that your transaction and did indeed happen on chain a once this proof is validated that is once the Oracle and the relayer agree with each other a message is sent to chain B to give the green light that your transaction is valid and can be completed therefore transactions are secure so long the Oracle and relayer are independent and do not maliciously collude with each other there are already multiple projects benefiting from this technology which according to the team has allowed the platform to secure over 7 billion in total value locked from dozens of projects across over 40 evm and non-evm chains such as ethereum arbitrim BNB chain polygon and optos notably the number of users actively interacting with dapps on layer 0 increased significantly following expectations for a big air drop especially after the announcement of its latest 120 million funding round here are some of the daps and protocols you can explore while you go on your airdrop hunting Journey first up Stargate finance a project which allows users to send native tokens directly to non-native chains without the need for rap tokens Stargate might be key to this airdrop hunt because one it was the first application built by layer 0. and two it is the most popular protocol on the network by TBL to interact with Stargate Bridge funds across any or all of their supported networks you can do this multiple times and afterward consider buying the protocol's native tokens sdg and staking it on their platform this will allow you to vote you can read through open proposals to see what's going on in the protocol and cast your votes on some of them if you don't want to leave any stone unturned then consider using other bridges built with layer 0. this includes the Aptos Bridge which you can use to transfer assets from other networks into optos liquid swap also allows you to bridge assets from optos into other networks like ethereum optimism and arbitrum just to name a few while you're at it you can also buy sell and provide liquidity since the platform is also eight decks now rinse and repeat by bridging funds through the other layer zero power Bridges including the usdc bridge and the Bitcoin Bridge next you can try getting familiar with the top layer zero powered dapps first we have radiant capital a cross chain borrowing and lending protocol built on arbitrim and BNB smart chain this year the protocol surpassed its all-time tvl amid growing rumors of the airdrop next we have cross chain dexes starting with sushi swap swapping tokens in the decks is pretty straightforward just make sure you toggle on the cross chain option which is the one which uses layer 0 Tech then we have Trader Joe a protocol that claims to be a One-Stop decentralized trading platform here you can swap lent borrow and stake assets Trader Joe also recently partnered with layer 0 to allow transfer of Joe tokens directly across different chains that the decks is active on there are also other smaller protocols gaining in popularity which have integrated with layer 0 in some way such as Kindle with its cross chain V tokenomics or rage trade with its Stargate powered vaults plus you may also luck out by interacting with tokenless protocols like rage trade which could also reward early users with their own airdrop last but not least you can interact with tofu nft a multi-chain nft market powered by layer 0 by buying selling or listing nfts on the platform if you want to put in a little more effort don't forget to join the layer zero community on Discord and be an active member now of course like I said there are many other projects building on top of layer 0 that you can take your time exploring but as always make sure to dyor and experiment at your own risk and remember that an airdrop is not guaranteed also matter Labs just launched their highly anticipated evm compatible L2 solution known as ZK sync era and there's been growing speculations of an incoming airdrop for early users there as well so click right here to find

RbI3Mnko7V0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbI3Mnko7V0,ever since ethereum Alternatives launched the crypto Community has been excited about every new chain on the Block which aims to solve the blockchain trilemma of security scalability and decentralization what if there was a blockchain that solved the trilemma and on top of that also protects users privacy well in this video we'll introduce you to one such promising project all of xero who also happens to be our sponsor for this video Olive zero is a permissionless proof-of-stake layer 1 blockchain which features a native and compliant privacy preserving framework called liminal and has had its mainnet launch since late 2021. however all of Zero's POS consensus all of bft has some unique features being peer-reviewed and is heavily modified from the average POS chain Olive Zero's POS consensus employs a rotating Committee of 128 validators which decide on the valid state of the blockchain with plans to increase this number as the network grows the main difference in terms of its architecture is that all of Zero's pus consensus also uses a directed acyclic graph as an intermediary data structure that complements it allowing for higher throughput and faster transaction speeds if suspected malicious activity is detected from nodes the validator's stake will be Frozen and placed under investigation to determine if the suspicious behavior is caused by an internal error or malicious intent while the decision-making process now falls on the all of zero team the this will eventually be decentralized and left to on-chain governance in future in terms of its privacy Tech all of zero achieves privacy by using its self-developed software-based multi-chain privacy layer known as liminal without getting too deep in the weeds liminal works by using a combination of zero knowledge proofs ZK snarks and secure multi-party computations smpcs and supports transactions between all of zero and different chains via Bridges to ethereum Cosmos polka dot and more ZK snarks allow provers to produce concise proof that can be used to convince verifiers that the prover is performing valid computations on its concealed data meanwhile snpcs involve performing operations on sensitive information off chain on several nodes with each node doing only a fragment of the operation this way nodes cannot access the whole data set without reaching a super majority consensus which is almost impossible liminal combines these two solutions as they make up for one another's shortcoming and complement each other this is because DK snarks are useful for basic transfers but are incapable of dealing with multi-user interactions and hence cannot enable private defy such as an amm Dex which doesn't reveal the value and details of each transaction meanwhile secure multi-party computation can do this but would be prohibitively slow to implement on its own it's worth mentioning that all of zero not only aims to offer data privacy to users but it intends to do so in compliance with current and upcoming regulations regarding data privacy with the recent release of smart contract support on its mainnet at the end of March Olive zero has also introduced an ecosystem funding program to Spur growth and attract Builders to the network in order to build out a thriving ecosystem of dapps for both defy and nft enthusiasts this program will serve as an incubator that provides funding knowledge and other resources to bring out potential of the projects building on its ecosystem even so there are already a slew of platforms wallets and NFD collections that are currently being built or integrated on the network some of them include Celeste an Institutional peer-to-peer lending and borrowing platform which also offers under collateralized lending abacs a permissionless lending platform similar to Ave and compound gate knocks which focuses on providing tools to onboard and manage clients that require corporate kyc and identity verification and even a dystopian themed RPG and social media platform dark verse dark verse deserves a little highlight as it boasts a star-studded team that has worked on AAA titles such as The Witcher series and cyberpunk 2077. on top of that it's World building supervisor is a renowned polish sci-fi writer whose book is currently being adapted into a Netflix series well there's plenty of things in store for all of xero in 2023 its unique architecture combined with an emphasis on user privacy has the potential to transform the way that individuals and corporate entities can interact with the blockchain if you're ready to dive into the world of all of zero head on over to their website at all of zero.org to read more about their technology and vision and if you want to learn more about ZK technology well we've got you covered with an explainer video right here [Music] with me,Youtube video,Aleph Zero: PROMISING Layer 1 Project in 2023??,2023-05-19 00:00:00,305.0,CoinGecko
2hkw7fy1qXg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hkw7fy1qXg,most of us are familiar with the top decentralized Finance protocols on ethereum but what about the other layer 1 and 2 Chains with the D5 movement gaining steam over recent years it's becoming increasingly clear that the space is much bigger than just ethereum in today's video we'll take a look at the top native D5 protocols on the top layer ones and twos to kick our list off we have the binance smart chain where pancake swap sits as the top protocol in terms of tvl pancake swap is a DEX that offers one of the lowest charges on trades at 0.25 per transaction the majority of the fee around 0.17 goes to liquidity providers 0.03 percent goes to the pancake swap treasury while the rest is used to buy back and burn cake the protocol's native token on top of liquidity mining pancake swap offers other products like the lottery prediction pools and even launched an nft Marketplace to allow users to trade their nfts directly on the platform the second biggest protocol on BSC Venus combines the benefits of lending protocols like compound and maker Dow's stablecoin minting system into one like many other money market protocols it allows users to deposit collateral to borrow other assets on top of that users can also use their collateral to mince the protocol's synthetic stablecoin VI basically providing a way to access liquidity while maintaining exposure to the cryptocurrency market Venus has other products like like Volts for staking and recently partnered with pancake swap to allow users to swap tokens without leaving Venus's UI moving on to the second chain Tron and its first Native lending platform just lend similar to many money markets in D5 justlend uses a pool-based lending model rather than connecting lenders and borrowers directly such that borrowers can then borrow funds from that pool and the interest that they pay is distributed among the lenders in the pool based on their share the second largest protocol is also part of the just ecosystem just stable it is a decentralized stablecoin lending platform that uses a dual token System including jst just native token as well as the stablecoin usdj to take out a usdj loan users have to deposit collateral forming a collateral debt position similar to maker Dows which allows them to mint and withdraw usdj next up we have an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution arbitrum the number one protocol on the chain is GMX a decentralized spot and Perpetual exchange that allows investors and Perpetual traders to perform cryptocurrency swaps and use up to 50 times leverage on the exchange the protocol also rewards liquidity providers and stakers of its governance token GMX another popular protocol on arbitrum is radiant a project that aims to bring together fragmented liquidity across different chains this allows users to deposit any major asset on any major chain and borrow various supported assets across multiple chains radiant launched V2 of the protocol earlier this year and currently supports cross-chain borrowing and lending on BTC eth usdt dye and usdc moving on to polygon another layer 2 scaling solution for ethereum and the leading decks on the Chain quick swap the Dex is a fork of uni swap so it basically uses an amm model to allow users to swap tokens on top of swapping tokens quick swap offers other products like Farms that allow users to earn rewards from their LP tokens featuring as the fifth chain on our list is optimism another ethereum layer 2. the top protocol here is a decks known as velodrome it rewards liquidity providers with its native token Velo which can be locked up in exchange for tradable nfts and voting power velodrome also has a bribing system that allows external parties such as protocols to bribe liquidity providers to deposit their tokens into a specific liquidity pool this is intended to help bootstrap liquidity and increase the trading volume on those protocols so once the liquidity providers deposit their tokens into the specified pool they are eligible to receive a portion of the bribe based on the amount of liquidity they provide moving on to chain number six we have Avalanche an L1 smart contract platform Avalanche hosts benkey a money market protocol that allows users to lend borrow and earn interest on their assets benkey also launched a liquid staking product that tokenizes staked avax and allows users to freely use it within d5d apps essentially creating greater Capital efficiency following benki in tvl on Avalanche is Trader joe a protocol that claims to to be a One-Stop decentralized trading platform it offers swapping lending borrowing and staking services on top of that Trader Joe launched an nft Marketplace known as Joe pegs that allow users to list and trade nfts last but not least we have Phantom an L1 chain with Halloween themed DFS the top protocol on the chain is spooky swap which provides the functions of your typical decentralized exchanges such as token swaps single staking pools and yield farming on top of that it provides nft services and a bridge that allows the transfer of tokens between different blockchain projects the number two protocol on Phantom is Beethoven x a fork of the balancer protocol similar to balancer Beethoven X's amm can support up to eight different digital Assets in one liquidity pool it also allows users to swap their tokens for other supported assets there you have it the most popular protocols on the top seven chains while ethereum more or less sets the standard for D5 and many of its top native D5 projects or its forked versions are deployed and dominate other chains as well we still see some Innovation from other chains and protocols which are trying to get in on the action that said if you haven't started out with D5 on ethereum check out the top projects here foreign,Youtube video,"TOP DeFi Projects on BNB, Arbitrum, Polygon & MORE!

5_I5kIiYnmA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_I5kIiYnmA,metamask has over 30 million monthly active users this number is nothing short of impressive however the wallet's popularity means that it's in the crosshairs of hackers and scammers watch this video till the end to find out some of the best tips to protect your metamask wallet from hacks all right tip number one use a strong password yes you've been told that a million times over but that just shows how important it is to have a strong and unique password we've all been guilty of reusing passwords for easy memorization but this is highly risky especially with data breaches happening left and right if you're still skeptical go to haveibinhone.com and enter your email address chances are you have had at least one instance of your personal information being exposed in a data breach a great solution is to use a password manager which stores your password securely so that you don't have to worry about remembering them allowing you to use strong and unique passwords for all your important accounts even in the case of Unfortunate Events like the recent LastPass security breach password managers are still overall a better solution than the alternative number two protect your seed phrase like an elephant protects its calf this means that you should consider storing your metamask sea phrase completely offline preferably writing it down on one or multiple pieces of paper and hiding them well just don't hide it so well that you forget how to find it you could also go a step further and store your seed phrase in metal crypto wallets they are usually designed to withstand extreme physical conditions like fire and floods moving on stay vigilant of fishing scams as this is probably one of the most common ways users lose their assets scam artists are getting creative and sometimes they'll fool unsuspecting users into giving out their seed phrases or other personal information they may typically redirect you to their fishing websites through emails that may be customized to look like they were sent by metamask once you're redirected to their website they'll trick you into inputting your seed phrase which is something you should never do unless restoring your wallet to make sure that you're protected stay alert when receiving emails and don't simply download files and click into random links before properly validating the sender's authenticity as they may download malware into your device tip number four use a hardware wallet it should go without saying that it's highly risky to have the majority of your crypto wealth stored in your metamask wallet remember that hot wallets are always online so there are more prone to vulnerabilities Hardware Wallets on the other hand are less convenient but reduce the risks of getting hacked so consider storing the majority of your crypto on Hardware wallets unless you plan to actively trade it though even if you have a hardware wallet don't be complacent as you are still as vulnerable to phishing attacks next up we have a tip that may be often overlooked keeping your metamask software up to date metamask regularly releases updates so keep an eye out for them to make sure that you're getting the most out of their new security features usually metamask software will auto update but just to be sure right click on its extension on your browser and select manage extension then check for any updates on mobile check the app or Google Store for any updates note that phishing attempts can come in the form of fake metamask extensions to stay safe head to the official metamask website which will direct you to the legitimate extension page next tip lock your metamask wallet when not in use doing this significantly reduces hacking risks compared to when it's unlocked for instance cleverly timed phishing attacks pulled off by getting a hold of your wallet addresses this is mainly because it's possible for websites to view your wallet address when your metamask wallet is unlocked tip number seven don't leave a trail of breadcrumbs for hackers to follow habitually do a cleanup of your browser's cash cookies and history this is a simple yet effective way of stopping Hackers from getting a hold of your personal information that can be used to impersonate you form a habit of cleaning your browser data at least once a week speaking of browsers use a separate browser profile for your metamask extension we mentioned how scam artists are getting creative so you should be wary of malicious extensions that might have excessive permissions to read your data the safest route to take would be uninstalling all your Chrome extensions however if you must have them installed do so in the separate browser profile tip number nine don't use public Wi-Fi using free public Wi-Fi can put our personal information at risk well it's not a guarantee that you'll be hacked there have been multiple cases of people getting hacked using public Wi-Fi usually because you don't know who set it up or who else is connecting to it just to be safe avoid any Financial activity while using public networks now last but not least review and revoke token approvals regularly to interact with smart contracts you'll typically be required to allow them to utilize either a specified amount or an unlimited amount of your assets malicious developers take advantage of the latter to drain your wallet next time when your metamask wallet requests a transaction approval click on edit permissions and enter your desired spending limit so that the D app cannot transact above the specified amount on top of that use a block Explorer like etherscan to see the smart contracts that have the approval to either access tokens or submit transactions on your behalf you can then select the specific approval that you want to cancel just keep in mind that you'll have to pay a gas fee as you can already tell crypto scams and hacks are not going to go away anytime soon especially with the crypto user base growing fast also in most cases scams are not outrightly targeting technical vulnerabilities in wallets like metamask rather they are targeting users like you counting on a security slip up so stay vigilant by applying these tips to your metamask and other hot wallets in general because ultimately the safety of your crypto is up to you drop any other safety tips below and click here to find out how to avoid scam projects in crypto,Youtube video,MetaMask Security: 10 Tips to NEVER Get Hacked,2023-05-12

0eq6_427us8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eq6_427us8,account abstraction could be the key to crypto Mass adoption we'll explain what account abstraction is and how it could be the secret sauce to onboard the next billion users into web 3. ux or user experience has been one of the biggest pain points for crypto and its further adoption since its Inception seed phrases wallets and interacting with daps are not actually considered simple for most people I find it difficult to understand none of us want to be that guy who lost Millions worth of bitcoin and has been combing landfills for the past nine years to find his seed phrase but what if losing your seat phrase wasn't the end of your portfolio's world what if you could recover your wallet via friends family or other means well before we get into that we just like to quickly give a shout out to our sponsor Undead's metaverse which is a AAA zombie themed MMORPG Survival game which unfolds in a post-apocalyptic metaverse built on ethereum to reward those jumping into the ecosystem early the project is currently offering bonus incentives such as nfts exclusive access to their Discord Channel a chance to win over one eth or a cashback on your mint costs and exclusive merch all for the very reasonable minting costs of 140 dollars at the time of shooting scroll down to our description box and click on the link to start minting this video will focus on account abstraction on ethereum but know that it can be implemented on other chains as well just so that everyone's clear the term abstraction here means to simplify or to hide away technical processes from the user that way they do not have to know how the underlying technology actually works to benefit from it before we can understand what account abstraction is we first need to understand the concept of accounts on ethereum there are two different account Types on ethereum eoas or externally owned accounts and contract accounts Cas otherwise known as smart contracts EOS are the regular type of account that users use to interact with ethereum these are essentially just public private key Pairs and so having the private key grants you access to do any anything within the rules of the ethereum network while on the flip side not having your private key means you can do nothing whether it's to make a transaction execute or interact with a smart contract it needs to be initiated by an eoa this limits the user friendliness of ethereum as it makes it difficult to do things such as batch transactions and requires users to always have enough ease to cover gas not to mention losing or exposing your private key can lead to a complete loss of funds or a thief requiring full access to them meanwhile smart contracts are accounts that are deployed on the network and run according to the code it contains they are not controlled by a user and so do not possess private keys they execute whenever instructed by another account whether that's another smart contract or an eoa herein lies the issue those smart contracts are flexible in their functionality in the end all actions need to be initiated by an eoa account abstraction solves these issues by essential turning user accounts eoas into smart contracts and unifying the two accounts which allows smart contracts to initiate transactions themselves this enables smart contract wallets which can have better ux or security features programmed into the wallets themselves such as no seed phrases with smart contract wallets private keys and Seed phrases can be abstracted away solving for the classic problem of losing your seed phrase or having them stolen because you can Define your own flexible security rules with smart contract wallets account abstraction could enable features such as biometric verification social recovery via friends family or a selected third party and this means that you could recover your account if you lose the keys honestly how many accounts would you have lost access to so far if you could not simply click on forgot your password now can you imagine scaling that to the entire global population no us neither paying fees in any token or no freeze at all having to to fund new wallets with eth to start transacting is one of the first hurdles that new users have to overcome smart contract wallets could allow gas payments in any token or even to pay for someone else's gas this means that projects could choose to offset and subsidize gas fees for users when interacting with certain dapps batching complex actions don't you ever get annoyed that you have to keep clicking on those pesky approve and confirm buttons whenever you have to make a transaction while you're not the only one account abstraction can be programmed to batch multiple operations and sign them all at once this makes ux better not just by making transactions faster but cheaper as well not having to sign approve and confirm every transaction also leads to uninterrupted user experience smart contact wallets have so much flexibility that the possibilities are endless you could program wallets to start a session with a preset duration upon signing and allow for as many interactions within the allocated session this work example could be a complete paradigm shift for gaming or social use cases automatic payment create automatic or schedule transfers recurring payments and other features which aren't possible with eoas all while maintaining self-custody of your funds this can be a useful feature for dowels and paying salaries making subscription plans workable on the blockchain and more ultimately account abstraction opens up more opportunities for dapps and wallet developers to innovate on user experience which is key to onboarding more people into web 3. so what's the current progress on Smart contract wallets ethereum developers have been pushing for account abstraction to be implemented on the network for years now however progress has been slow as earlier proposals saw resistance as they required core changes to the ethereum protocol plus Focus remained on shipping the merge recently though the latest proposal for account abstraction eip4337 was authorized in March and saw support as it did not require changes to the consensus layer which could speed its adoption further good news is that other projects particularly l2s like starknet and ZK sync which started development after understanding the benefits of account abstraction have the feature natively supported are you interested to learn more about

zcB6-RxUCrg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcB6-RxUCrg,take a stroll in the land of crypto Twitter and it won't be long before you come across Mega threads like these after all who doesn't love free money I deserve free me for certain airdrops like Aptos last year farming it would have cost a grand total of zero dollars all you had to do was hop into their test net and with just a little bit of hard work boom two thousand dollars four thousand dollars as for the more enterprising individuals this figure could even run up into the Millions okay so you might have missed out on the Aptos airdrop but fear not there are plenty of opportunities still for you to seize your chances especially early stage projects with a glaring absence of a token the best part there are rumors that there will be another round of Aptos airdrop and who knows doing all of these may just help you to kill two or even three birds with one stone but first a quick introduction to Aptos Aptos made the headlines last year with its multi-million funding from high-flying VCS like a16z coinbase multi-coin Capital jump Capital Etc the blockchain also attracted the media Spotlight because of its colorful past as one of the Facebook chains based on the DM blockchain created by meta since DM was abandoned some of its developers banded together to spin off Aptos which here is the programming language called move that was originally created for DM like most l1s Aptos was created with the goal of establishing an ultra fast scalable blockchain that is more accessible to the average user now on to the juicy bits how can you get your hands on some airdrops well if you haven't already the first thing you gotta do is get some funds onto Aptos and while it's unlikely the official Aptos bridge will have its own token just its usage might help with the subsequent rounds of Apt airdrops oh and did we mention that the bridge is also built on layer zero and we all know what they've been saying about layer zero there are many options for you to store your optos assets there is martian pontem fuchsia Petra Evo so which of these is the best and which one should you use well any respectable airdrop farmer would tell you that the answer is all of them using all of these wallets potentially lets you claim not only the subsequent apt airdrops but also the wallet's own airdrop if there's any so be sure to interact with as many dapps as possible with them buy and sell using the wallet's own swaps if they have one and of course the standard playbook for all Air drops try to remain active in their community and complete all of their quests or tasks compared to other chains the world of nfts on the optos blockchain is relatively vibrant and has quickly become an alternative hub for nft enthusiasts and in the center of this is topaz an Open Sea like Marketplace for nfts in fact topaz is now available for airdrop with similar terms as blur to qualify users will have to buy nfts listen to sell on topaz and make and accept collection bids other nft marketplaces on Aptos include blue move and souffle so make sure to go through the same actions on them to spread your airdrop net far and wide apto's name is a domain name service supported by apto's labs and functions similarly to ethereum name Services instead of a long string of mumbo jumbo you can buy a nice looking name and use them in place of an address when it comes to airdrop farming it doesn't get easier than domain names simply hop onto their website look up the name that you want select the length of your registration period connect to your wallet to pay and voila rinse and repeat if desired remember Pont and wallet from earlier turns out that they have another product in Optimus 2 called liquid Swap and guess what the token is already pretty much confirmed the question is when and how and although airdrop farming isn't an exact science there are things that you can try to maximize your chances since liquid swap is a DEX Buy buying and selling tokens on it would be a good start as well as becoming a liquidity provider liquid swap also has a bridge that is again powered by layer zero so make sure you give it a good go on it too interestingly pontem also has two nft collections called Quantum space pirates and Quantum Dark Ages and word on the street is that these may or may not get you some Pont too the easiest way to think of tortula Finance is that it's the Lido Finance of Aptos and like Lido is a liquid staking service that lets you freely redeploy your otherwise staked and stuck apt in the form

u4sV-Btg1Ag,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4sV-Btg1Ag,Mev or maximal extractable value has been a Hot Topic especially for the most popular smart contract platform in the industry ethereum from harming users to even threatening ethereum centralization and censorship resistance Mev has come to be one of ethereum's biggest issues so let's find out exactly what Med is how it works and how it affects the ethereum ecosystem [Music] Mev refers to the profit that can be extracted by minors or validators who use their privileged access and power to include exclude or reorder transactions in a block but let's unpack that a little bit more by recapping how transactions take place on ethereum in the first place when you initiate a transaction on ethereum there is a period when it'll be pending waiting to be added to the blockchain during this period your transaction will be stored in a sort of waiting area known as a mempool since miners or validators have the power to access these transactions and are responsible for adding them into blocks they also have the power to include and order them and this is where Mev comes in but still what impact could simply reordering some transactions on the blockchain have well a lot according to flash Bots an Mev focused research organization over 687 million has been extracted from transaction reordering on ethereum since January 2020. the worst part is of course that in many cases Mev is sometimes referred to as the invisible tax as it is extracted at the expense of honest users trying to make transactions however other forms of Mev are actually beneficial to the functioning of the ethereum ecosystem but more on these in just a little bit MAV is a highly Technical and complex topic out of the scope of this video to discuss it in full so let's just look at some of the Practical examples of some Mev strategies in action starting with a healthy type of Mev Arbitrage in crypto tokens might have varying prices on different dexes therefore arbitrageurs and Mev Bots can Prof profit from this opportunity by purchasing say ethereum at sixteen hundred and fifty dollars on Sushi Swap and selling it on uni swap at Seventeen hundred provided other users are not harmed in the process this form of Mev is considered non-toxic since it is essential in maintaining price stability across D5 another healthy type of Mev comes in the form of liquidations for you to take out a loan in lending protocols like coffee you'll have to deposit some collateral first suppose the market takes a dip and the value of your collateral drops below the required ratio due to the permissionless nature of dops your collateral can now be liquidated by anyone with the know how to do so and you'll have to pay a liquidation fee this is where the Mev opportunity arises Mev Searchers will try to determine the borrowers that are most likely to be liquidated and be the first to submit a liquidation transaction thereby pocketing the liquidation fee now this Mev strategy is also considered beneficial since for one it helps in making sure that the lender is paid swiftly and it also prevents the protocol from accumulating that debt however like I said not all Mev opportunities are healthy so let's take a look at some toxic ones starting with front running so front running happens when Mev Searchers use Bots to scan the mempool for potentially profitable transactions and replicate it with a higher gas price so that it goes through first that's not quite all since Mev opportunities are so highly sought after multiple Front Runners will be competing for their transaction to be included in the next block therefore congesting the network and raising gas prices for everyone else as an extension of just plain front running another malicious type of Mev is known as sandwiching or a sandwich attack so say you place an order to buy two thousand dollars worth of asset X on uniswap Searchers will first identify this or other large pending transactions that will likely cause a price change of the asset then the sandwich attack goes like this first the Mev Bots will front run you to insert their buy transaction before yours which bumps up the price of the asset first then your buy transaction is executed though at a higher price than you initially intended your order also bumps the assets price slightly the attacker then immediately dumps their tokens right after your transaction to complete the sandwich attack the attacker benefits from the price change while on the contrary this results in an undeniably worse trade for you as you will experience larger your slip Edge and receive a lesser amount of acid X than you would have initially received at two thousand dollars so what are some of the ways to tackle Mev well ways to tackle Mev are an active area of research for ethereum developers and contributors currently there are several methods available such as dap level Solutions such as cow swap which in brief submit Traders transactions in batches in order to counter reordering users can also take individual preventative measures such as linking up to flashbots or Eden Network's custom rpcs which can minimize Mev attacks one of the major Solutions being developed is known as PBS or proposer Builder separation which would limit centralization risks as parties that build blocks cannot be the same ones that propose it flashbots an organization dedicated to democratizing Mev extraction and mitigating its negative impacts developed the most widely used implementation of PBS a software known as Mev boost which allows validators to Outsource the work capturing Mev opportunities ironically however mov boost has arguably made ethereum more centralized given that post-merch over 65 percent of all ethereum blocks are proposed through Mev boost on top of that censorship issues have also been raised after the tornado cash Saga when flashbots announced that they'll begin censoring transactions to be ofac compliant in fact over 60 percent of ethereum transaction blocks are now ofac compliant post merge it's important to mention that the flashbot solution is considered an out of protocol version of PBS which as the name suggests simply means that it exists outside of the protocol ethereum plans to implement its own inbuilt PBS and even tweaked its roadmap to specifically cater to Mev issues this will come via the scourge of grade which as vitalik buterin puts it aims to ensure reliable and fair credibly neutral transaction inclusion all in all the scourge may turn out to be another significant upgrade to ethereum especially now that the ecosystem's security and censorship resistance is involved so make sure to give us your thoughts on the subject and watch this video

n_WqxvaReDo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_WqxvaReDo,one of the most anticipated layer 2 scaling solutions that has been in the works for over four years just launched yes we're talking about ZK sync era which as its creators put it is meant to usher in a new era in ethereum the scaling solution has already surpassed 100 million in TBL with a number of projects already live and hundreds of others building on it in this video we will dive into the history and evolution of the project how it works its new features and its ecosystem stick around to find out why it is considered a first mover plus some insights on a potential airdrop now while ZK sync era previously known as ZK sync 2.0 just launched the history of zika sync begins way back in the summer of 2020 with ZK sync 1.0 now known as ZK sync Lite this was less than half a year after matter Labs the team behind ZK sync had revealed their vision of creating a trustless scaling and privacy solution for ethereum based on ZK or zero knowledge Roll-Ups with an emphasis on user and developer experiences they went on and raised 2 million that year through a series seed funding round LED by The Venture Capital firm placeholder between 2021 and 2022 three more funding rounds were held led by notable firms like Union Square Ventures Andreessen Horowitz AKA a16z and blockchain capital raising over 256 million during this period from 2020 to 2022 matter Labs rolled out ZK sync 1.0 which had minimal utility outside of token transfers and swaps mainly because the L2 solution did not offer smart contract support this was bound to change as matter Labs had their focus on launching the baby Alpha of the version 2 of their scaling solution in late 2022 as the first ever production-ready ZK roll-up that is compatible with the ethereum virtual machine or evm this is a big deal and achievement in the scaling solution world as prior to Solutions like ZK sync ZK roll-up Solutions offered benefits such as security and fast speeds but lacked compatibility with the evm making it difficult for developers to Port their existing codes hence hindering adoption so the race to launch an evm compatible ZK roll-up solution has been on for a while now with layer 2 projects hoping to capture first mover Advantage matter Labs did just that by launching the main net of ZK sync era on the 24th of March after about four years of development but what does it do and how does it work we have already mentioned that ZK sync is a scaling solution for ethereum so it basically aims to make ethereum faster and cheaper to be more specific though ZK sync uses zero knowledge Roll-Ups a type of scaling technology that bundles up batches of transactions which are then validated as a single transaction on ethereum since the transactions are bundled up users share the gas cost among themselves this has a major upside cost wise in that unlike some l1s and l2s the fees get cheaper with more transaction demand however the reverse is also true meaning fewer transactions equals higher fees that's it fees are still fairly really cheap and are typically lower than the two to three dollar coated on the metamask UI as a higher upfront fee is deducted based on estimated costs but most is refunded back to the user if it is unused moving on there's another type of roll-up known as optimistic Roll-Ups used by L2 such as optimism and arbitrim what sets ZK Roll-Ups apart from this one is that zero knowledge Roll-Ups are trustless relying purely on math and cryptographic proof to verify transactions we have a video that goes in depth into zero knowledge technology but it is simply put a cryptographic technique that can conceal the details of a transaction while also executing and validating it using this technology to skill ethereum significantly cuts down withdrawal time from an L2 to the mainnet to a couple of minutes or hours unlike optimistic Roll-Ups where withdrawals take roughly seven days due to the security parameter of maintain attaining a one week challenge window for disputes on top of the ZK roll-up technology ZK sync era delivers other features such as support for account abstraction which makes user accounts more programmable and therefore more flexible for example a wallet can be configured to require security steps like biometric verification two-factor authentication social recovery via family or friends or even to make automatic payments without a third party this feature mainly tackles user experience issues which era believes when dealt with will bring about Mass adoption another feature that the scaling solution delivers is a low level virtual machine or llvm compiler compilers are basically computer programs which translate code written in one language to another we mentioned that era is evm compatible but this is different from evm equivalence which is achieved by Solutions like polygon zkevm the difference is that projects on ethereum can Port their application to polygon zkevm without needing to change the code whereas to deploy a project on era it will need to be compiled using the llvm compiler zksync's founder Alex gluchowski explained that they are deviating from the evm equivalence industry standard to leverage the maximum potential of ZK proofs for the future and hence innovate faster the team also notes that these features are important building blocks for hyperscalability which introduces other scaling chains known as Hyper chains which are supposedly separate ZK chains but connected with trustless Hyper Bridges this would theoretically remove any cap on the total throughput of the ZK sync era ecosystem let's now explore the ZK sync era ecosystem before ZK sync era opened to the public a number of dabs that already started building on the network prior to the full launch of the main net and have contributed to the ecosystems rapidly growing tvl which currently stands at over 113 million this value is contributed by around 15 protocols as of making this video with sync swap a decentralized exchange being the dominant protocol on the layer 2 making up more than 50 percent of the Chain's TBL apart from projects that are already live on the network zksync reveals that 200 plus projects including chain link Sushi swap uniswap Ave and curve have registered their interest to deploy on zksync era alright now on to the elephant in the room the airdrop a ZK sync token has long been confirmed and of course with that is speculation that the project will reward early adopters through an airdrop some attribute the fast growth of Aeris TBL to this fact especially when compared to polygon ZK evm which is already clarified it will not launch a new token with its tvl sitting only at around 1.5 million despite being launched only days after a ZK sync era with that said the project CEO stated in an interview that the chain currently has no need for a token until when it will be required for the eventual decentralization of the chain so patience is key for the airdrop Hunters out there well that's all for today but we still have the latest content on other ethereum scaling Solutions click right here to see how the current two most popular scaling Solutions polygon and arbitrim compare laughs [Music],Youtube video,zkSync Era Mainnet is FINALLY Here: Potential Airdrop??,2023-04-28

rHQXJMaBNqM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHQXJMaBNqM,are you curious about the latest developments in ethereum scaling well today we're going to quickly compare two Titans in the scaling solution industry polygon and arbitrim we'll see how they both square up in terms of their Tech tokens unique features and other metrics a great place to start is to look at the team background Behind these two projects polygon was founded in 2017 and was still known as Matic Network at the time meanwhile off-chain Labs the company behind arbitrim was founded sometime in 2018 and both projects took around three years for their main net to go live polygon is spearheaded by a team with software engineering and product management backgrounds while arbitrim is led by a computer science professor as well as a couple of software Engineers polygon was then the most popular ethereum scaling Solution by tvl but Arbiter was closing in the distance fast but more on that later for now let's focus on how the projects differ from each other technology wise perhaps the biggest difference between the two projects is how they scale ethereum polygons Flagship product the polygon POS side chain as the name suggests scales transactions on the ethereum network by running alongside it simply put polygon handles ethereum's transactions on a separate ethereum compatible blockchain but is linked to ethereum Via a process known as checkpointing which is basically posting information about polygon's transactions on ethereum's Main net transactions are only finalized on polygon once these checkpoints are posted on ethereum and in this way polygon can benefit from ethereum security by having historical records of transactions that can be compared what about speed polygon achieves speeds of up to 7 000 transactions per second arbitrim on the other hand processes around 40 000 TPS it does this through the use of optimistic roll-up scaling technology which allows it to execute transactions on its chain and roll them up into one transaction to be recorded on the ethereum mainnet the solution is built on top of the base layer of the main chain such that it can Leverage the l1's underlying security mechanisms while conducting transactions on a separate layer speaking of building on ethereum here is a quick shout out to our sponsor for this video Undead's metaverse which is a AAA zombie themed MMORPG Survival game which unfolds in a post-apocalyptic metaverse built on ethereum currently the project is offering bonus incentives to reward those jumping into the ecosystem early players can head over to their website and mint now to get a bunch of extra perks such as antidote nft access to a private Discord server and a chance to win a cash back on your mint costs an extra 1.1 eth and an undead merch box all for the very reasonable minting costs of 140 dollars at the time of shooting scroll down to our description box and click on the link to start minting alright let's get back to the video the main difference between side chains and Roll-Ups is that side chains exist as separate blockchains and operate independently but have mechanisms such as Bridges and checkpointing to link it back to the base chain this means that side chains use their own consensus algorithm and so do not inherit ethereum security Roll-Ups like arbitrim on the other hand are designed to handle transactions off the main net but are still rooted to and rely on the consensus mechanism and thus security of the main chain therefore for example if you have coins on an L2 your assets can always be converted into assets on the main chain as long as the underlying chain in this case ethereum continues working however assets on a side chain can get compromised independently without the underlying chain being affected let's now look at some numbers comparing the two starting with the total value locked arbitrim is is currently the leading scaling solution for ethereum in terms of TBL with over 2.2 billion locked followed by polygon with over 1.12 billion locked polygon had previously held the top position for a while and it wasn't until the end of last year that arbitrim took the number one position a huge chunk of arbitrim's tvl can be attributed to the popularity of GMX the deck switch has over half a billion dollars locked and other protocols like Radiance uniswap and Ave each with over 100 million locked the most popular platform on polygon is Ave with over 300 million locked dexes like quick Swap and balancer each have over 100 million locked that said polygon still Reigns Supreme in terms of the number protocols on its chain and active daily users according to defy llama the scaling solution has 360 D5 protocols on its chain compared to arbitrim's 263 and over 3000 and active users compared to arbitrim's 150 000. both projects have native tokens polygon has Matic which is used to secure and pay Network fees and arbitrum has ARB which is solely used for governance since the network still uses eth for fees each of them has a maximum supply of 10 billion tokens with over 9 billion Matic already in circulation compared to arbitrim's 1.27 billion ARB Maddox market cap sits at around 10 billion while ARP sits at roughly 2.1 billion they have different token allocations and Supply schedules which you can get a clearer picture of on our website in the new tokonomics section moving on let's catch up with some of the latest developments from each project remember how we said polygon's main product is a side chain well in July last year the polygon ZK evm was announced which is polygon's new scaling solution the scale ethereum we need a solution that Inc increases speed and reduces cost it uses zero knowledge Roll-Ups to scale and according to the team is notable compared to several other competing ZK roll-up projects as it will be evm equivalent the test net of the scaling solution went live last year and the beta version of the mainnet went live in March this year it promises faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining ethereum's compatibility and security polygon has also been making some significant strides in terms of brand Partnerships Landing deals with big names like meta Disney Coca-Cola Reddit Adidas Adobe and NFL just to name a few meanwhile arbitrim has also been pushing new developments such as its Nitro implementation which drastically reduced fees or its recent Arbiter Nova chain which is catered to Social and Gaming use cases arbitrim also finally conducted its highly anticipated airdrop this year just a few days prior to pull ZK evm's beta launch this officially marks the conversion of arbitrim into a dow which would allow holders to vote on the protocol's key decisions to wrap things up both polygon and arbitrim offer Innovative scaling solutions that aim to improve the efficiency and affordability of transactions on the ethereum network polygon is the more mature scaling solution of the two as it has been around for longer and is still ahead in terms of the number of dapps deployed in network activity however our return being the relatively new kid on the Block surpassing both polygon and other l2s in tvl isn't a fee to dismiss and it's worth noting that l2s which inherit ethereum security are generally considered to be the path for scaling ethereum in the long term with both projects working on new products such as polygon zero knowledge ebm or the recent arbitrim Nova chain it's clear that these scaling Solutions are playing an important role in the ethereum system and will continue to be a focus of development and innovation in the years to come speaking of which watch this video to find out more on the recent developments from arbitrim and what comes next

WJLL0gor4iI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLL0gor4iI,lsds were invented to make staking easier and to unlock the liquidity of your staked teeth by allowing you to receive a receipt token that you can use to earn additional yield on D5 protocols on top of staking rewards in this video we'll go through the top 5 liquid staking protocols for eth and some other cryptos as well starting with Lido Finance the first liquid staking provider and the current leader in the space with over 9 billion in stake tokens the protocol was launched in December 2020 to allow users to stake eth and in turn receive sdeath tokens a tokenized version of their asset that are pegged one to one to eat in the background after you deposit your tokens into Lido they are staked on their respective proof-of-stake networks you in turn pay a 10 fee on your earnings which is split between node operators and the Lido Dow once you receive your sde tokens you can use them like regular eth for trading on exchanges or even through the entire Define Network basically allowing you to earn additional yields from your staked assets without having to take them out of the Lido pool currently Lido offers up to 4.7 APR on eth and has added support for other POS coins like polygon Solana polka dot and kusama the platform also has its own native token known as ldo whose main use case is governance therefore allowing users to cast their votes in any decision that may shape the future of the platform next up we have rocket pool which was launched roughly a year after Lido rocketpool also removes the barrier to entry and staking by allowing users to stake as little as 0.1 each this amount is pooled with eth from other stakers to add up to 16 each each Staker then receives our eth tokens depending on their deposits the remaining 16 eth is contributed by an investor looking to become a node operator stakers can get up to 3.5 percent APR while node operators get up to seven percent APR and eth rewards on top of the platform's Native RPL token rewards as for the platform fees rocketpool charges a fee of 15 on stacos rewards which entirely goes to node operators rocketpool's RPL token power is the platform's 2 house protocol Dao and Oracle Dow the former comprises community members who decide what changes will be made to the protocol while the Oracle Dao is an invite-only group of members who deal with the platform's technical stuff as of making this video unlike Lido roccopul currently offers staking services for only eat at number three we have frax finance a project that started out as a stable coin and is now expanded its ecosystem to offer eth liquid staking services that turns eth into frax eat this receipt token acts more like a stable coin Loosely pegged to eat users then have two options they can either use their frax eth to provide liquidity on the ethrax eath pool on curve and benefit from the yield farming opportunities from the curve and convex ecosystem or stake their frax East to receive staked fracks eth or s-rax eat which is the token that accrues staking yield currently the APR for S frax eth is at 5.6 percent while the APR for providing liquidity in the frax eth slash eath pool stands at 7.2 percent which is notably higher than other LSD platforms frax can pull this off as it benefits from large quantity of CRV and CVX held in its treasury giving them higher bribing power to vote for higher incentives in the form of curve convex and frax tokens to be directed to their frax eth pool which is how frax eat holders can earn higher yields by being liquidity providers currently the protocol only supports the staking of eth at number four we have steak wise another LSD platform with a multi-token model launched in early 2021 stakewise allows you to deposit any amount of eth into their pool to receive an equal amount of staking eat whose token is called Seth 2. within a day of receiving Seth 2 you can start accruing rewards in a separate token known as reward eth or re2 basically meant to make tracking of rewards easier the platform charges a 10 Commission on these rewards statewise also has its native swice token that allows holders to govern the platform's major decisions such as fees paid by stakers or commissions paid to note operators to name a few last but not least we have stator a multi-chain LSD platform that supports staking in Chains like near Phantom BNB and plans to add an eth LSD ethx to its lineup this year based on the ethx light paper the yield is expected at 6.75 percent with yields coming from both staking and Mev rewards stator has announced that from launch anyone will be able to run Staters ethx nodes permissionlessly with a four eth Bond requirement one of the low lowest in the space the platform aims to supplement these permissionless pools with permissioned ones operated by Community approved and reputable entities with good track records stator plans to launch ethx this year most likely within the first half of the Year these are some of the most popular liquid staking protocols among each stakers in a space that is unlikely to have stopped growing now all eyes are on ethereum's Shanghai upgrade and there's no doubt that lsds have been attracting a large number of crypto users Lido overtaking d5's long-raning leader in terms of TBL maker Dow as the largest D5 protocol is proof enough so do you think that the LSD narrative is here to stay or is it just type well let us know in the comments meanwhile click right here to find out more about what's driving the

u2TLgy32Zg4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2TLgy32Zg4,in the past few weeks the biggest banking collapse prices since the 2008 financial crisis unfolded before our very eyes Silicon Valley Bank collapsed collapse of a big Bank two big bank failures are roiling the financial Market funds depositors and companies scrambled to recover their deposits while Banks struggled and ultimately failed to stem their bleeding losses even now markets remain on the edge in fact many are of the mind that the crisis is far from over more trouble is coming what exactly happened how did it happen what part does crypto play in this and though we're not quite as Charming as Margot Robbie in a bubble bath watch on and together we'll get to the bottom of things in this video on March 8th Silver Gate Bank a major Banker to the industry shut down its operations and began liquidation following the bankruptcy of FTX but this was only the very tip of the iceberg the biggest banking crisis since Washington Mutual in 2008 traces back to this bank called Silicon Valley Bank Silicon Valley Bank as its name might suggest has a niche clientele that mainly consists of startups Venture capitalists and many smaller tech companies the pandemic in 2020 was a hot market for all these clients and deposits from these clients started soaring with this sudden large influx of cash svb decided to invest in the U.S treasuries and government-backed mortgage Securities just as most banks would it was the best of times it was the worst of times soon after the pandemic wave passed inflation started rearing its head towards the fast-growing economy this was when the Fed started their fire fight against inflation with a series of rate hikes given the rising rates depositors started pulling out funds from banks in search of greener pastures in Money Market funds which now offered higher rates compared to what the banks were giving money market funds they were among the big recipients this impacted smaller Banks like svb essay simply could not afford to match and raise their deposit rates as the interest rates on their U.S treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities Bonds were bought from when interest rates were at record lows this meant that their assets were now earning them less than the current Fed rate and well the bank's going to pay more than what they were earning it certainly didn't help that cash strep startups and Tech firms started hungering for liquidity too soon inflows turned into outflows for svb as its clients swarmed to withdraw [Music] remember when interest rates rise bond prices fall the wheels for svb finally came off when they were forced to sell their bonds to pay their depositors taking on a multi-billion dollar loss the bank tried to raise additional Capital by selling its shares but this was the straw that broke the camel's back sparking a frenzy Bank Run that dried up its cash reserves this forced the government to step in and provide liquidity just to make the depositors whole over the same weekend the FDIC had to shut down Signature Bank when it too suffered a run when depositors rushed to withdraw after getting spooked by the collapse of svb shortly after long-standing Mega Bank Credit Suisse grazed the headlines too for all their own reasons mired in controversies the sell-off for Credit Suisse shares already started all the way back in 2021 but when its share prices did by 30 percent in March Swiss authorities had to step in but even then this was not enough in the end the bank's biggest rival UBS swooped in with an emergency takeover meanwhile in the U.S First Republic Bank was also on the brink of collapse remember Silicon Valley Bank as it turns out Circle the issuer of usdc stablecoin was also one of their clients when Circle announced that they had 3.3 billion worth of their cash reserves held at svb Panic ensued in the crypto Valley following this usdc depeged and plunged to 87 cents while other dollar Peg stable coins such as die usdd and usdp also followed suit since then they have all recovered their dollar Peg somewhat ironically Circle wasn't the only crypto company falling victim to the troubles brewing in the world of traditional Finance Loch fi Avalanche proof and yoga labs also revealed their exposure to svb But Here Comes the tough question is crypto the villain or victim in this Arc while Senator Elizabeth Warren is quick to pin the blame on crypto for the collapse of crypto Banks like silvergate Elizabeth Warren wants silvergate Bank to explain its ties to FTX there's actually a broader perhaps more concerning systemic risk at play here just as President Biden put it no it's not over yet the same underlying issues that plagued svb silvergate Signature Bank and Co are also in other Banks which means they too will be vulnerable to bank runs especially since pretty much all banks run on a fractional Reserve System and paired with the fact that nowadays money is digital and can essentially move at the speed of light it's not like in the old days where people would need to physically show up at their bank and fill out paperwork a recent study shows that U.S banks are carrying an unrealized 620 billion in total losses due to the value drop in their government Bond portfolios thanks to creative legal accounting tricks the banks have been able to hide these massive unrealized losses from their depositors and shareholders another study shows that if even just 10 percent of uninsured depositors withdraw their money from Banks 66 Banks would go under and if 30 percent of these depositors withdrew 106 Banks would fail by this logic Bank says they are are simply hanging by a thread that is consumer confidence and if that ever snapped as for crypto Warren is hell-bent on continuing her Onslaught against the industry am I buying uh euros are you buying air going as far as building an anti-crypto army that earned a plus from even the conservatives the age-old battle against regulation continues for rep 3 and this time around the Arena May turn out to be crypto friendly Banks as things look the right ahead is still bumpy and as always we caution our

hcX0eAtd4Zs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcX0eAtd4Zs,watch this video till the end if you are a beginner considering getting into cryptocurrencies you'll find this video helpful if you're unsure how to invest safely into crypto especially with a number of unfortunate events in the space that have occurred over the last year all right let's get to it before you embark on your new Journey there are a few things you need to know first investing in cryptocurrencies is considered risky is very volatile well it's true that there's some level of risk in every investment however investing in crypto is especially so as it is highly speculative and unexpected changes in Market sentiment can lead to sharp and sudden moves in price on top of that there are counterparty security and even regulatory risks it certainly won't be a smooth ride so be ready to weather down storms along the way this brings us to the second Point invest only what you can afford to lose the age-old principle of investing as much as you can afford to lose is even more so applicable in crypto yes the crypto Market has seen unprecedented growth and value over the past decade but this doesn't negate the possibility of 90 plus percent drops or new projects going to zero so budget for your crypto investment properly practice good risk management and keep in mind that there is no guarantee that the value you put into a token will hold in the long term So speaking of the long term crypto shouldn't be seen as a get rich quick scheme because of social media sometimes there is a lot of hype around crypto and some get involved in the digital asset with a mindset of getting that money quick but this path unfortunately rarely ends well this is not good as a beginner keep away from anything you don't understand even if it's promising big rewards remember Bitcoin took over a decade to reach sixty thousand dollars plus in value and if there ever will be a token to achieve this huge feat it will take time and it is often the steadfast and patient toddlers who will reap the biggest gains moving on to point number four watch out for scammers as the market grows so does the number of scams in the industry from scam artists who try to steal your keys to ponzis and pump and dump schemes a lot of money has already been lost to dishonest actors so always be on your guard and if anything sounds too good to be true it probably is here's another point you should remember to hold on to always do your own research for first before taking action d-y-o-r looking at a coin's price history is nice but it's not quite enough before you choose what to invest in take the time to dive deep into projects to determine if they are really worth your money and time though if you are just starting out we highly recommend wrapping your head around the largest cryptos like Bitcoin and ethereum before you wander further from the list now the biggest independent and most trusted coin aggregator coin gecko is a great place to start just head over to our website or app and find the coin that you are interested in the coins page displays some important information like market cap trading volume circulating and total Supply on the right side of the coin page is the info section where you can find the official website white paper and social pages which you can use as a starting point to do your research scrolling further down you'll find the exchange section which shows the different exchanges the coin is listed on assuming that you've done your research settled on a reputable exchange and completed the necessary sign up steps it's time to make a purchase most centralized exchanges allow you to deposit funds via your bank account credit card or debit card however this may differ depending on the exchange and your country of residence once your account is funded you can start buying and selling crypto so now that you have made your purchase I would advise you not to have it sitting on an exchange especially if you have sizable funds in light of the FTX Saga there is no better time to emphasize this point since even in reputable exchanges your funds are not quite bulletproof hot wallets are alternative to keeping crypto funds on an exchange but there are other safer options like cold wallets which unlike hot wallets store your private Keys offline therefore reducing security risk so get a cold wallet I would definitely advise you to so it's important to note that there are other means of investing in crypto apart from huddling and trading but as mentioned earlier don't print your money into anything you don't fully understand on that note we have more beginner friendly videos that go in depth into the points we have covered in this one and cover more cool basic crypto stuff so check them out in this playlist right here [Applause] thank you [Music],Youtube video,6 CRUCIAL Tips You Must Know Before Buying Your First Bitcoin,2023-04-10 00:00:00,364.0,CoinGecko
GU8EDukMy_E,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU8EDukMy_E,it's arbitrim season now and all eyes are on the ethereum L2 network arbitrim is cheap fast and easy to use all these plus the rumors of its upcoming airdrop and you have a recipe for Success right there in fact the network even flipped ethereum in daily transaction count just recently A Real Testament to its Rising popularity but while attention on arbitrim and its cousin optimism are definitely well deserved news about the Holy Grail of crypto is also bubbling spreading and this Holy Grail could very well be the final form of blockchain as we know it the crypto end game so let's take a look at ZK evm before we get into what ZK EVMS are we must first recap on the two different types of L2 Solutions optimistic rollups and ZK Roll-Ups both types can help improve ethereum scalability by processing transactions off chain then adding them to the blockchain in batches afterwards however the key difference between the two is in the way transactions are verified so long story short optimistic rollups which are what arbitrary and optimism use have transactions submitted to the main chain by validators and are assumed to be correct unless otherwise challenged by verifiers who can submit fraud proofs in the case of any disputes on the validity of the submitted transactions on the other hand ZK Roll-Ups use zero knowledge validity proofs to validate transactions since it's not based on assumptions like optimistic rollups DK rollups can help improve the speed privacy and efficiency of a blockchain all while maintaining the same level of security as ethereum however zero knowledge proofs are extremely complex and hard to implement this is why ZK Roll-Ups are generally less scalable compared to other types of Roll-Ups plus they're also not evm compatible which makes them even harder to build on top of but what if there's a way to address all of these limitations of ZK Roll-Ups well enter ZK evm an evm compatible zkl2 with ZK evm ethereum projects will be able to easily Port existing smart contracts to the network without any modifications to their code this ease of implementation helps set the grounds for wider adoption even vitalik buterin also noted that l2zk solution will drive the future of ethereum scaling with ZK evm there will no longer be any barriers with regard to scalability security decentralization and developer experience this is why many have crowned it as the end game or Holy Grail of crypto many expected ZK EVMS to come years from now but many projects have made significant Headway with the majority of the big names targeting a launch this year so what are some of the most popular ZK EVMS out there well ZK sync is a user-centric ZK platform developed by matter labs and has been around as early as 2020. ZK sync's new product ZK sync era will be a ZK evm reiteration of their product according to glucowski ZK sings CEO ZK sync era already has well over 200 projects waiting on the sidelines to deploy on its platform ZK sync is one of the household names for ZK and its upcoming ZK evm has garnered much hype and attention from the crypto space a lot of new possibilities to verify protocols basically cheap transactions and high speed the error chain is currently close to General users but leaks and rumors of its airdrop are already circulating with many guides outlining ways that you can qualify using the ZK sync test net zkasync era is slated to launch in the coming few months known for their web 2 ties with Blockbuster Brands such as Disney Starbucks Adidas and Prada polygon is one of the most recognizable names within the space polygon started out as an ethereum side chain but in 2021 it completed a 250 million purchase of the Hermes Network to Kickstart polygon Hermes a ZK roll-up platform so fast forward to July 2022 and polygon announced that they were building a zkevm polygon ZK evm beta has been confirmed to launch as soon as March this year making it the first evm compatible ZK roll-up to reach the ethereum main net most ZK evm projects use a type of cryptographic proof called ZK snarks but Stark wears starknet has instead opted to use ZK Starks in theory ZK Starks are more secure than ZK snarks but they also consume more gas take longer to verify and occupy more space start where the company behind Stark net has been the main driving force behind Stark based technology the starknet alpha launched on ethereum mainnet in November 2021. the team also announced that starknet will have its own governance and utility token scroll is another ZK evm solution that is in collaboration with the privacy and scaling Explorations Group which is officially part of the ethereum foundation Scrolls architecture is similar to that of polygon ZK evm with its Advantage being higher composability capability but at the trade-off of a slower performance in addition scroll is also aiming to build the first ZK evm that is evm equivalent with no changes to the state or logic within their consensus at all okay then last but not least we have Tycho which is another ZK evm that strives to be fully evm equivalent however this type of ZK evm usually has very slow prover time which can be detrimental to user experience Taiko mitigates this by seeking to reach finality quickly before the ZK proves are even generated instead of proving the current state Taiko only has to prove that the past state is still valid and that no changes have been made tycho's Alpha 1 testnet has just been closed recently so those who are interested in giving it a spin will need to wait for the Alpha 2 test net the ZK evm war is well and truly underway and while all of these Solutions have different mechanisms it's hard to say for sure which is superior to another scroll in Taiko for instance might have better security and decentralization but ZK sync and polygon zke evm are faster so it all comes down to what your preference is well if you want to refresh your memory on optimistic versus ZK Roll-Ups check out our three minute animated video on it right here [Music] thank you,Youtube video,Top zkEVM Projects to Watch in 2023: Ethereum's ENDGAME??,2023-04-07 00:00:00,489.0,CoinGecko
Gb1bq4CoNVk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb1bq4CoNVk,in the gaming World racing games are certified Classics and have a special place in Gamers hearts since its birth in the early 1970s the genre has been a driving force in the evolution of the whole of video games including the emergence of blockchain racing games that allow Gamers to enjoy the thrill of speed and competition while giving them a chance to earn nft rewards now let's rev this engine and jump straight into the five best play to earn racing games that you should absolutely consider trying Let's Race to kick us off we have rev racing by animoco Brands a game that kick-started the next generation of blockchain racing games as the first ever arcade simulation car racing game on the blockchain Rev racing has grown to be one of the most popular gaming D apps on its native chain polygon rev racing attempts to give users the feel of traditional racing games with cars that feel different from each other cool features like real life tracks controller support and is playable directly from a browser you can also test your driving skills against other players by competing in events for a chance to win Shard and red and create your own nfts through the fusion system to get started with rev racing you'll have to buy some rev tokens as an entry fee the ecosystem's native currency then buy a car nft from the Rev racing collection on openc and finally verify your account to get the full play to earn experience the game is powered by The Shard and rev tokens both of which can be used across the Rev Motorsport ecosystem next up we have another game by animoka Brands Moto GP ignition built on the flow blockchain as an officially licensed MotoGP competitive management and collectibles game this means you can own and trade Collectibles of your favorite bikes and personalities from MotoGP on the blockchain including the video moments Hot Shots Moto GP ignition has two game modes Champions a fantasy sport

entities coming in the future from deciding what you want your Rider to do on a lap by lap basis to maintaining your bike and Rider's condition and even building a full racing team the game is also powered by The Shard and rev tokens if you're looking for more horsepower literally then pegaxi might be for you instead of racing with cars or bikes you race with horses cool looking winged Mech horses to be exact to play pegasy you'll need to buy a Pega nft afterwards you can enter a race for free as of making this video pegxc hasn't released a player-controlled gameplay mode so after the race starts it's pretty much hands off you'll have to watch your Pega compete against others with factors such as the horse and Stadium attributes determining your performance the goal of the race is to place in the top three and earn rewards in the form of viz it's in-game currency players can also earn tokens through breeding and selling or renting a Pega to a player for a share of their earnings next up we have zedron another racehorsing game with futuristic horse nfts similar to pegaxi zed offers you a collection of nft horses after purchasing one through the Zed run openc collection you can either start competing in Races by first paying a buy-in fee that determines the size of the prize pool or participate in free races that offer XP Rewards paid races offer a top six payout structure meaning that all of the top six racehorses receive a share of the prize money these races are simulated though the unique characteristics of your horse play a part in determining its likelihood of winning this of course may make breeding a lucrative strategy for playing the game last but not least we have dragon cart a Mario Kart asks skill based 3D racing game dragon cart is built on the binance smart chain and features cute cartoon characters taken from the peak along series by a well-known Vietnamese artist named Tong fly the game offers two gaming modes free to play and play to earn the former works by giving new players a default character and racing car to participate in the racing Arena of dragon cart while rewards are not limited to play to earn users it'll take significantly longer for free to play users to achieve higher ranks and win rewards than players who buy characters and cars in the marketplace cart dollars the in-game currency can be staked to receive points which can be redeemed for other nfts all right those were some of the best racing play to earn games but as you can see developers are trying to come up with blockchain based games that people would actually want to play of course earning while at it is the icing on the cake but attracting and maintaining players is the real obstacle that they have to overcome first that said if racing games aren't your thing check out this video where we cover a complete review of Big Time a blockchain based MMO RPG game foreign,Youtube video,Top 5 Play-to-Earn Racing Games You Must Try in

G7TaFOxnOsA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7TaFOxnOsA,one of crypto's most anticipated open Secrets has happened with our return finally air dropping their governance token ARB on the 23rd of March the arbitrim airdrop arbitrum ARB airdrop the Armature token arbitrome airdrop if you haven't checked your eligibility already chances are you have some free tokens waiting for you if you've done any of these before the 6th of February this year now since we last covered Arboretum just five months ago the ethereum L2 solution has made some really impressive progress within this short window of time arbitrim has cemented itself as one of the biggest household names in crypto with its tvl doubling to over 1.8 billion dollars in just these five months it's also no stranger to headline grabbing Milestones including multiple flippenings where arbitrim overtook its big brother ethereum and number of daily transactions or fees on more than one occasion with its airdrop drumming up even more excitement and attention it's safe to say that arbitrum season is well and truly underway okay so first a bit of a refresher on Arboretum so arbitrum was started by off-chain labs and it's designed as one of the main L2 solutions to solve ethereum scalability issues so there are two types of roll-up Solutions when it comes to layer 2 blockchains we have optimistic Roll-Ups and ZK Roll-Ups so in both of these transactions in the layer 2 Chains are rolled up into one transaction as an output to be recorded on ethereum so this helps to save gas costs and relieve congestion on the main net the Roll-Ups in optimistic Roll-Ups are considered optimistic because they're assumed to be innocent and correct until proven guilty the innocent until proven guilty or by a transaction's validity can be challenged for up to seven days this is the type of roll-up that arbitrim and optimism use so here's a little-known fact the chain that we're so used to referring to as just r arbitrim is actually called arbiterm one now for those of you who've checked your arm airdrop eligibility you might have noticed something called arbitrim Nova so Arbiter Nova was launched in August last year and is actually designed as a sister chain to arbitrum one but one that's optimized and dedicated for gaming and social applications arbitrim Nova doesn't have the same decentralization trustlessness and permissionlessness security guarantees of its roll-up sibling and this can offer much lower fees some of the biggest names in crypto and web 2 are already building on Nova such as Reddit who's in the process of launching their Community point system on the chain and then also Google Cloud Sushi Swap and more now at just 1.9 million tvl it doesn't quite command the attention and reputation that it sibling does but with more and more attention being channeled to arbitrim as a whole it's not too far-fetched to think that Nova will soon follow after too back in its early days arbitrim could allow transactions at a throughput of 2 000 to 4 000 TPS far ahead of ethereum's limit of 15 transactions per second then the team rolled out the Nitro upgrade in just September last year which blasted the throughput of arbitrum up to 10 times higher to 40 000 TPS along with a slew of other improvements by reducing the amount of data posted to ethereum with Nitro transaction costs on arbitrum were massively reduced Nitro also brought about several other quality of life changes on the development front such as improved ethereum gas compatibility improved L1 interoperability gethry sing for broader debugging support reduce performance costs for validator notes by more than 90 percent and many many more immediately after the upgrade transactions on our return quadrupled and Looking Back Now arbitrim Nitro might have been the fuel that sparked Arboretum season after all soon after their groundbreaking Nitro updates off-chain labs dropped another announcement on their expanded validation lineup in November which includes well-known organizations such as the ethereum foundation consensus mycelium L2 beat and more currently validation on arbitrim is permissioned and the team is in the process of transitioning into a permissionless decentralized structure in hindsight was this their hint of an upcoming governance token just last month off-chain Labs announced the release of stylus a next-gen programming environment upgrade for both Arboretum one and arbitrim Nova with stylus users will be able to deploy programs written in their favorite programming languages including rust C and C plus to run alongside evm programs on arbitrim the result is faster dapps lower fees and a more inclusive Computing language environment that paves the way for faster developments in the entire arbitrim ecosystem so after all these upgrades and updates leading up to the ARB after the question remains what's next after the airdrop with the release of R arbitrim will officially transition into a dow model and put governance power into the hands of the Dell users will be expected to vote on proposals that pass through the arbitrim Dao or delegate their voting power to delegates of their choice the arbiterm Dao will collectively have the power to control key decisions from how arbitrim's technology is upgraded to how Revenue can be used to support the ecosystem in addition the arbitrim foundation also announced the creation of the arbitrim security Council a 12-member multi-sig of respected community members the council helps to ensure the security of the chains and will act quickly in the event of a security vulnerability the launch of arbitrim orbits along the Arab token also means that it'll be easier than ever for developers to launch their own customized layer 3 chains using arbitrim's infrastructure Paving the way for easier faster expansion of the entire arbitrum ecosystem well the upcoming launches of zkevm or base chains detract attention away from the current king of l2s that remains to be seen for now however arbitrim season is here and all eyes are on it now want to learn more about ethereum L2 Solutions check out our

IKln4SMsC-E,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKln4SMsC-E,decentralized Finance the so-called wild west of crypto [Music] has had its fair share of yeah just had to be their moments especially when the industry was flying for instance there was a time protocols were offering astronomically High annual percentage yields to attract users during this period it was commonplace to see yields running in the range of four figures or much much more now while some projects still offer these unrealistic returns there seems to be a change of tactics with real yield entering the chat well it wouldn't be crypto without a fancy buzzword for the trend so in this video we're going to be discussing the concept of real yield and more before we go any further it's essential to understand how protocols for paying out these high yields in the first place during the D5 summer which kicked off in 2020 compound finance a lending platform launched the comp token to reward users for providing liquidity this move from compounds sparked the yield farming craze leading to more protocols mimicking the model higher after all seems better right well that's not quite the case if there is a catch to fund these unrealistic returns protocols put in place excessive and unsustainable token emissions in plain terms with high inflation basically projects rewarded users with their native project tokens that do not have much of a use case these have often been mockingly called useless governance tokens while protocols that use this strategy for bootstrapping found success initially for the vast majority of projects it would prove to be unsustainable in the long run for a bunch of reasons first this formula would only work as long as the demand for the token increases proportionally to the new emissions however this is often not the case as these tokens usually have aggressive emission schedules making them highly or hyperinflationary on top of that the demand for these native tokens rapidly dwindles as they have few or no use cases and their value quickly becomes close to worthless second most users who farm for yields were uncommitted to projects such that they would even develop farming strategies that would involve hopping between protocols in order to get the best apy most of them would just farm and discard the native tokens immediately to secure their gains therefore a better model had to be considered and this is where real yield comes in this meant scrapping the strategy of relying solely on aggressive token emissions to carve out a model that is based on a genuine and generally committed user base in this model yields are generated by capturing a percentage of a protocol's actual Revenue which include but is not limited to trading fees interest fees and management fees ideally like in any sustainable business model the protocol should earn more than it spends in other words it should earn more money from revenue than token emissions and operational costs let's find out how this model works by focusing on a real yield project like GMX a decentralized spot and Perpetual exchange the protocol has two native tokens glp and GMX the former is a liquidity provider token that is received upon users locking an asset in the glp pool to represent their stake in the pool GMX token on the other hand is the protocol's governance and utility token that offers holders an opportunity to earn income through staking stakers and glp holders are rewarded with a cut of the protocol's revenue generated from the fees paid by the users every time they make a transaction seventy percent of this revenue is paid to glp Holders while GMX stakers get the other thirty percent paid out in eth this framework sets up a model that ensures constant income for GMX users as long as the protocol continues to attract people to use their platform hence generating fees however GOP holders who are the liquidity providers are essentially in a counterparty relationship with Traders such that when the trader wins glp holders lose as Trader profits are paid out from the liquidity pool meaning that in this scenario glp holders are the ones who suffer another example of a real yield project is Umami Finance which offers automated yield farming vaults for assets like usdc BTC and eth built on top of GMX the protocol allows users to stake its Umami governance tokens to receive a share of protocol Revenue in the form of eth the yields are funded by the fees charged for their products and 50 is distributed to Umami holders while the rest is routed back to the Project's Treasury however you should note that this real yield model is not bulletproof as it also brings in a new set of challenges challenge accepted for one paying out a portion of Revenue to users would mean less capital for the protocols to reinvest into the project also as we mentioned earlier real yield or not the protocol should be profitable whereby revenue generated surpasses token emissions operating costs and the fees paid out to users generally speaking this new model pushes the industry to put out projects that provide real value to users as opposed to incentivizing users with tokens printed from thin air well this was the point of D5 from the beginning anyway right to serve users better than Trad Phi that said you'd still need to look at more than just one statistic when assessing whether a protocol all is healthy or not before making an investment decision so what other metrics do you personally consider well let me know in the comments and in the meantime click right here to

Cp0MafI8pLI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp0MafI8pLI,is Bitcoin a climate disaster Bitcoin mining is impacting the local environment to burn an awful lot of electricity tremendous amount of computing power and electricity this anonymity has a price and the planet is paying it many people view Bitcoin as a revolutionary technology that has the potential to change the world so in the world is only going to buy and sell products using Bitcoins but it often gets me attention not for this but instead for its energy consumption and alleged environmental impacts with a major Focus being on its supposed major contribution to climate change so let's examine some of the common accusations to see if they hold up but before we discuss the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining it's important to understand the value Bitcoin provides while bitcoin's energy consumption is quick to be singled out by critics you'll find there are plenty of Industries and uses that also consume huge amounts of energy take the internet or Refrigeration for instance which obviously provide tremendous value to humanity and as a result don't get the same negative attention this reveals that underlying criticism of bitcoin's energy consumption is the belief that Bitcoin provides no or insufficient value to justify its energy use there's no relation between value and usefulness or is merely a speculative asset for the financially privileged the cryptocurrency industry represents the largest Ponzi scheme in history these assumptions are far from the truth Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that allows for fast secure and borderless transactions it has no Central Authority which means that it is not controlled by any government or financial institution and this is enabled by the thousands of independent nodes supporting the network which of course take up energy it's eye-opening to see that adoption of Bitcoin for day-to-day transactions is highest in developing countries it is also an alternative sought after by communities dealing with political instability human rights issues or weak Financial privileges such as those facing high or even hyperinflation which is actually the reality for a majority of the global population take Ukraine for example during the Russian invasion aside from accepting donations in cryptocurrencies for war efforts the Ukraine's vice prime minister tweeted a request for donations in the world's largest cryptocurrencies many ukrainians were able to flee their country with crucial life savings in Bitcoins in Lebanon locals have turned to bitcoin and other digital currencies as a life raft as many citizens have been locked out of their own bank accounts to the extent where citizens have resorted to armed robbery in an attempt to retrieve back their own funds meanwhile activists and protesters of various causes across the world from Hong Kong Thailand Nigeria Belarus various Latin American countries and more have used Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to bypass censorship and oppression now that we've gone over how Bitcoin provides value let's get down to the numbers so how much electricity does Bitcoin consume you may have come across comparisons with the energy use of countries like Switzerland or Malaysia but what are the exact figures and comparisons to Global usage well according to the Cambridge Center for alternative Finance Bitcoin as of late February consumes about 116.77 terawatt hours per year which is about 0.56 percent of global electricity use now it's important to note that the terms electricity and energy do not mean the same thing whereby electricity is only a subset of global energy use making up about 20 percent this means that as a percentage of global energy use the Bitcoin Network only takes up 0.19 percent so what does this mean in terms of climate impact to measure this we need to look at Carbon emissions which depend on how the electricity powering Bitcoin is generated fans on the top this these bands are strong fans are they from fossil fuels or renewable and low carbon sources well Cambridge estimates 38 of the network to be powered by low carbon sources such as Renewables and nuclear energy which results in 63 megatons of carbon emissions annually at time of shooting this is 0.13 percent of global emissions do take note that cambridge's data on energy sources relies on National or state averages which do not take into account Bitcoin miners mining off grid Bitcoin mining forms co-located with Renewable Power plants or even mining with carbon negative energy sources such as waste methane which could mean that the share of climate-friendly mining is actually higher another common misconception floating around are the per transaction metrics comparing each Bitcoin transaction to the emission versions of hundreds of thousands of Visa transactions or the energy use of households in the U.S but this is misleading as mining Bitcoin is different from transacting with it since the majority of the electricity actually goes towards securing the network as miners compete for the block reward rather than validating transactions on top of that with layer 2 Solutions like the lightning Network an unlimited amount of transactions could be bundled into single transactions on the Bitcoin Network which means that energy use will not necessarily increase proportionally to network growth lastly we can expect energy use to naturally reach a ceiling as block rewards decrease with each having and minor competition cools off so no Bitcoin is not going to consume all of the world's energy at some point in the future so circling back to bitcoin's climate impact its emissions can be reduced until they become next to nothing so long as the electricity powering Bitcoin is generated from low carbon sources like Renewables or nuclear energy rather than fossil fuels however Beyond minimizing negative impacts we are starting to see that Bitcoin mining could even have the potential to be a net positive for the climate as it could spur the adoption of Renewables by providing Financial subsidies to renewable energy providers to continue operating or expanding as renewable energy capacity continues expanding in line with global efforts to reduce emissions Surplus generation of renewable energy which is fairly common even today will become all the more frequent and can be uneconomical for re providers as this means that they have to reduce output below what they could otherwise produce this is due to the fact that electrical grids need supply and demand to be precisely balanced at all times to avoid grid instability which would result in things like blackouts Bitcoin miners are well positioned here to soak up this cheap excess energy and ensure that there is a buyer for the electricity that re operators can produce now perhaps more excitingly there are also more and more miners who mind with waste methane which is a less abundant greenhouse gas but one that is 20 to 80 times more potent at trapping heat than CO2 in the near term mining using waste methane from oil wells landfills or the agriculture sector can therefore result in a slowing of global warming as methane is removed from the atmosphere which helps us buy time in fighting and adapting to climate change we've just only scratched the surface here on how the Bitcoin Network could provide net benefits to The Climate regardless Bitcoin is by no means a silver bullet for climate issues but clearly it is not the climate and environmental Menace it is painted out to be so what are your thoughts on bitcoin being a climate disaster what changes do you think should be adopted by Bitcoin miners if any well if you're

JhngxUoJU5w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhngxUoJU5w,artificial intelligence has been all the buzz lately with chat GPT triggering the most recent AI hype wave GPT chat gbt chat gbt there's a chance that you've heard of people asking chat gbt some crazy questions like debug my code or tell me an unfunny joke well its numbers are even crazier chat GPT is estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users in January just two months after launch that's not all this wave of AI hype even got to the crypto industry driving the price of AI tokens up so in today's video we have compiled a list of some of the industry's most popular crypto AI projects without further Ado the first project on our list Singularity net remember Sophia [Music] no not the Disney princess but you know the humanoid robot by Hanson robotics that went viral and once said that it wanted to wipe out humans I will destroy humans well the firm behind Sophia the robot is integrating blockchain technology into their work and claims that they want to create a platform where developers can share their AI work in a decentralized way we can have an open decentralized AI platform of you know AI by the people of the people for the people with the ultimate goal of advancing AI capabilities a phenomenon they call technological singularity The Singularity that can complete that connection between AI developers and AI users plus it would allow developers to create AI products directly for customers cutting out the middleman to make all of this work singularitynet has three main products the first one is the AI Marketplace a Dap that lets developers list their services the other product is the AI publisher a platform that allows AI professionals to build simultaneously and finally the third core product is the ecosystems native token agix which facilitates transactions staking and governance what if there were programs that could perform economic transactions on your behalf based on their own decisions this is supposedly one of the core features of fetch.ai that is so fast a decentralized open source platform that combines blockchain Ai and machine learning technology to attempt to deliver autonomy to the blockchain they call these autonomous programs agents and one of the fetch ai's goals is to create an ecosystem known as the open economic framework where the agents can interact with Digital Data to increase the performance of the system to better explain the concept of Agents fetch.ai gives us an example of a fetch agent that can detect weather conditions by being connected to a vehicle's windscreen wiper and forward that information to the digital ecosystem with the goal of easing the delivery of appropriate Services relevant to weather information the agents only represent information the information isn't stored on the fetch Network the platform is powered by its fet token which has many purposes from connecting agents and nodes to the network to allow allowing agents to exchange information next up we have alethia ai a decentralized artificial intelligence project that is attempting to bring nfts to life they call this new type of nft intelligent nfts or infps which are basically nfts embedded with new Advanced features like voice recognition AI animation and generative AI abilities so ultimately one of their primary goals is to create design and train net of teas to be intelligent enough to interact with users these nfts will exist on the alethiah metaverse known as Noah's Arc and can be traded in June 2021 the first inft Alice was auctioned at South bees for 478 thousand dollars in other news the project introduced its newest Innovation known as character GPT a generative AI system that allows text character generation to create intelligent and tokenizable characters also Mark Cuban is one of the early investors of alethia as he participated in the company's private token sale back in 2021. next up we have ocean protocol an AI project that is mainly focused on data and how it can be monetized ocean views data as a financial asset and through the protocol it can be tokenized into erc20 assets known as data tokens that exist on the blockchain these data tokens could be particularly useful for say data scientist or AI professionals who benefit from access to more data so interested parties could buy them on Ocean's data Marketplace the marketplace can be more or less viewed as a decentralized Exchange in that users can earn the platform's native token ocean by trading data or even staking data essentially becoming liquidity providers for the opportunity of earning a percentage of the exchange fees that the pool generates last but not least we have numer air a new type of collaborative hedge fund where a data scientists around the world predict stock market returns using AI the protocol offers two main products the first one is known as signals a place where stock market strategies are uploaded to support a certain trading style or a specific stock submit a signal and get immediate feedback on this original the most prominently featured one is known as the numerator tournament which is a competition that takes place weekly and allows data scientists to submit Stock Market trading algorithms that's not all data scientists are allowed to stake the platform's native token NMR on their submitted models and are rewarded if their predictions perform well otherwise they're staked NMR gets burned so the big question is is the recent AI Buzz Justified or is it just another AI hype cycle while the tech has been developing rapidly and has shown some exciting developments as with chat DPT is a bit more difficult to say the same for some AI focused blockchain projects which may not have Market ready products even after many years of development so don't get too caught up and ape into these projects due to fomo fomo dog and do your due diligence as always dyor anyway we also had a bit of fun with chat GPT asking it some spicy crypto questions and the answers were definitely interesting so click right here to watch that video thank you [Music],Youtube video,Top AI

-uomwbdSxTE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uomwbdSxTE,crypto has always been a narrative driven space time and time again we've seen how a single unsuspecting tweet from Elon could send the market soaring or tumbling I mean in fact Dogecoin season back in 2021 pretty much started out because of elon's tweets and then there was also the food coin season and the D5 summer days of 2020 the play to earn jpeg season of 2021 and as good as those days were they're already in the past narratives come and fade just as quickly and you need to be on top of your game to ride the wave so that begs the question what are the top new crypto narratives of 2023 okay let's start out with the obvious here LSD LSD is what everyone on crypto Twitter is raving about LSD the recent Crackdown by the SEC on centralized staking services offered by companies such as coinbase cuecoin and the likes has only driven more users towards decentralized options like Lido rocket pool anchor stake wise and others and many foresee that liquid staking will only become even more popular after each withdrawal is enabled after the update so as we get closer and closer to Shanghai in March interests and excitement in this area are likely to intensify okay then this has been another big one in 2023 all thanks to the rise of our future Overlord chat GPT the AI wave has fully taken over crypto now most projects that have even the most remote association with AI have been tossed into the spotlight and graced by Green soaring prices and inspired by this turn of events several new AI meme coins started popping up spearheaded by image generation protocol image generation Ai and many many other copycats then the AI narrative really turned up the heat after news broke of Microsoft's chat GPT purchase and Google's investment in another AI chat bot Bard now every other crypto project is eager to slap on the AI label to ride on the hype train what is this hype the hype so artificial intelligence is a promising technology with a bright future for sure but it's worth noting that many current AI projects in the cryptocurrency field lack significant substance or practical applications so we'll see how long this hot Trend will last in the space arbitrim is dominating the L2 narrative with 1.42 billion total value locked it is now the fourth largest ecosystem in crypto behind only ethereum BSC and Tron and yes that also puts it ahead of other household giants like polygon Avalanche and fellow L2 competitor optimism so a large part of arbit room's rise can be attributed to its crop of native protocols like GMX radiant Jones Dao Camelot and more GMX alone is contributing over 30 percent of the total ecosystem liquidity and has been one of the key reasons if not the key reason for arbitrim's popularity then there is also the rumor of arbitrim's token airdrop coming soon and yeah that has spurred even more attention and activities from the users as they're all in the hopes of getting a slice of the airdrop Pie when will it come well we don't know yet but our term is filled with many interesting opportunities that we can explore while we patiently wait if you've been in crypto for the past few months you have seen the term real yield being tossed around randomly by every other project out there but where did this come from what does it mean well it all goes back to GMX from arbitrim again so the idea of real yield is that you can earn a portion of a protocol profits as yield as opposed to the unsustainable liquidity incentives propped up by the projects themselves profitable protocol sustainable Revenue model put these together that's how you get real yields so the idea itself isn't new but GMX managed to package it into a catchy phrase and popularized it as the protocol caught on fire now real yield has spread far across crypto but remember not everything is always as it seems then open editions so open Edition drops aren't new in fact they've been around as early as 2021 when nfts started gaining steam fast forward to late 2021 and we have the largest nft drop ever Pax open Edition merge collection which sold for nearly 92 million since then the nft market has quite a down but recently open editions are back in style and in this new and revised meta open editions nfts are usually sold for at a low account possibly ten dollars or less most of these nfts can then be burnt at a later date to redeem an evolved version of the same nft so this gamification helps create a Perpetual demand for the collection as collectors often need to burn more than just one nft to get the next Edition one of the most popular open editions checks by Jack butcher has generated more than 6 million trading volume to date and it's not just one either so thanks to this nft Marketplace manifolds volume has skyrocketed in recent days as more and more creators launch their projects on the platform with nfts back in demand attention on nft Phi is also growing as we see more and more need to unlock nft's liquidity here we have another nft narrative and this time we're turning our lens onto the father of crypto itself Bitcoin you heard that right Bitcoin Bitcoin nfts have been around as early as 2014 but this time around the attention is more unique so thanks to ordinals assets such as jpegs and even video games can now be inscribed directly on satoshi's on the Bitcoin blockchain without a need for a side chain or additional token so that sounds cool but the controversies of ordinals have driven a wedge in the Bitcoin community so on one side we have users applauding The Innovation and the positive effects this has brought about but then on the other hand we have Bitcoin enthusiasts decrying the callous use of bitcoin's security feature well regardless the fact is that Bitcoin nfts are soaring in popularity with already more than 11 000 of them minted to the network at the time of writing okay then ethereum needs l2s to scale as of now we've seen l2s utilizing optimistic rollups in action that includes arbitrary and optimism but there's another type of roll-up called ZK roll-up which many have proclaimed to be the next biggest thing for ethereum while ethereum utilizes on-chain activities to process transactions and validate blocks ZK Roll-Ups will also introduce off-chain function which will help to make transactions faster and also cheaper and in typical crypto fashion one of the main reasons why the ZK narrative is gaining momentum is due to air drops many are expecting upcoming token launches by ZK ecosystems such as zksync starknet and polygons ZK evm sometime this year this has also resulted in other ZK related protocols such as Mina protocol and immutable X outperforming the market too with so many catalysts in place the ZK narrative is definitely one to look out for this year so there you have it seven of the top crypto narratives to look out for in 2023 remember crypto can be extremely volatile narratives can Wane just as quickly as they appear so always dyor as I do my own research and make sure you do not get blinded by the hype so we made a few videos about the trends that I just talked about such as on real yield layer twos and lsds which we've Linked In the description below so be sure to check them out if you want to dive deeper to end on a side note if you've ever wondered who will come on top in a boxing showdown between CZ and vitalik well then check out our video right here where I ask chatgpt some of the spiciest questions in crypto [Music] foreign [Music],Youtube video,Top 7 BIGGEST

nfjGIExm454,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfjGIExm454,why are there so many sausages here I don't know actually someone brings other things to this barbecue I'm Lillian my name is Carissa I'm Sammy hi I'm stinky hi I'm Vera hi I'm Q so what's it like being women working in web 3 like how do you feel about it honestly I would say that from my interactions with people there's not much difference whether you're male or female when you talk to people there's not much differences in the way people treat you and I think one interesting thing is that our team is actually women Dominator we have more women than men in the team itself and I guess yeah like I don't feel discriminated in any way like at coinjeko so it's honestly been great working here and like everyone's super helpful super nice I guess because I'm also in Tech and that is also a very male dominated space I don't feel that there's too much difference between these two like Industries so I guess I have already kind of gotten used to being like the only girl in the team and stuff like that why are there so many sausages here I don't know but you know hopefully someone brings other things to this barbecue when we first started the channel is 91 male dominated so how do you feel about being a woman working in web 3 it is very challenging especially if you're a woman from the male perspective they would think like oh it's not important to them like we don't have to talk about crypto with them you know it's very hard to get into that conversation sometimes so you have to like educate yourself and do things on your own basically at first to be honest um I guess I felt quite intimidated as well you don't really see a lot of representation yes it is something that I could feel inferior about but that's not something to push me away from the industry itself it just means that maybe there's like a lot more women or a lot more people outside that maybe just don't have enough exposure to give them the confidence to join the industry being a woman in web 3. first of all I think rather than just limited to women of web 3 I think this applies to web 2 as well normally I find that working as a woman let's say in the tech industry people do take you a bit less serious compared to us a man counterpart you do always have to work a lot harder in my opinion and my experience to actually make a point and also as a woman we do tend to be emotional it's just in our not just in our DNA we can't help it and not saying it's a bad thing you know empathy is a great thing but um when you work with your male counterpart you do have to sort of control your emotions when you work with them because if you show a bit signs of that then they might dismiss you as being unreliable so that's something that I'm still trying to learn to sort of uh learn how to control my emotions and be empathetic at the same time do you have any advice for women who want to work in Webster I would say um just follow your heart right if you really want to do it just go for it just pick up whatever skills that you need just just you and before you know it you might be in that place yes it can be intimidating but I think I'm also pretty lucky where I actually have people who like even males colleagues that are like really supportive and things like that okay like just do it honestly like you have to contribute to the numbers too like to increase that if you wanted if you want the numbers to increase you got to contribute to it yes yes I think my knowledge is mainly like retail investor knowledge and I didn't come from like a web free background but I would say like as long as you're passionate and you take time out to like research and learn about it yeah you can just go for it yeah I'm actually not from a web tree background either I actually come from a background video game so I would say that we are Testament that you don't really have to be like a hardcore crypto investor to you know become a woman in web 3 try to be more proactive in terms of like trying to find communities because there are groups of like women in crypto even in like on Twitter there's also like communities you can just associate yourself with to gain more knowledge to gain the exposure and gain connection so I think the first step is to push the fear away and just you know try to put yourself out there and build the connection if you're already planning to join this industry that I feel like as a woman that you will have to work a bit harder compared to the men who are just easily given like a space in this industry but as a woman you do have to like really always be on your A-game because we're also always very scared of being called out by you know men to be like you don't know your so like as a woman I feel like I have to know my stuff so you have to put an extra work to kind of know everything that's on kind of that I feel that additional pressure I would say gone to crypto Twitter read a lot watch a lot of YouTube videos especially our YouTube channel actually our YouTube channel is really really catered to uh beginner friendly videos be very firm in decision making or whatever you do and always have reasons on why you do things I think it helps in every job that you do as well just just be firm and then be nice but you know don't take crap from others yeah nice yeah from what noise,Youtube video,Asking Women What It's REALLY Like Working In Crypto,2023-03-08 00:00:00,322.0,CoinGecko
QekCES0_i64,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QekCES0_i64,bear markets they're nothing new in crypto in fact there have been roughly three of them in the industry from which some interesting theories have been drawn for instance drawdowns from Peak to bottom in each cycle are getting smaller as well as a theory that ties bitcoin's bear and bull market to its carving schedule see after every four years block mining rewards are reduced by 50 and every single bitcoin's having event that is in 2012 2016 and 2020 has led to significant bull runs now there are other parallels being drawn so let's find out more by jumping straight into examining Bitcoin Cycles starting from July 2010 roughly two years after Bitcoin was created and when the first accurate bitcoin price tracking occurred it's Bitcoin began trading at a fraction of a penny but climbed to around nine U.S cents by month's end after two months of sideways price movement its price started to rise in October and peaked in June 2011 at around thirty dollars a whopping 33 000 rally in the same month however the first Bitcoin crash tied to the Mount gox hacking incident happened Mount gox was the largest crypto exchange at the time where the majority of Bitcoin was held and traded the hack caused bitcoin's price to temporarily Fall by over 99 from around 17 to Just a Penny in just a day but the crash didn't last though after the recovery prices began to fall and bottomed at about two dollars in November so in approximately five months Bitcoin lost over 93 percent of his value you this marked the end of the first cycle and beginning of the second cycle the second cycle began with a steady rise in price followed by a rather uneventful year except for the first ever Bitcoin having which occurred in November 2012. this event reduced mining rewards from 50 Bitcoin to 25 Bitcoin per block bitcoin's price started steadily Rising until it hit a new all-time high at around 267 dollars in April 2013. however this was followed by a sharp drop to roughly 60 dollars less than two months later and immediately followed by a price rally that peaked at 1244 dollars in December marking roughly two years since 2011's bear Market bottom after the 2013 Peak a bear Market followed this time seemingly kick-started by by the Chinese government's decision to ban Banks and other financial institutions from Trading and storing Bitcoin we essentially have cut us off from allowing customer deposits into BTC China's Bitcoin exchange the bear Market saw Bitcoin touch 165 dollars in January 2015 and 86 drop from the Cycle's Peak the following cycle did not have any major price movement for the better part of 2015. it wasn't until the end of that year that Bitcoin seemed to be breaking out of the nine plus months of consolidation the second Bitcoin having happened nine months later in July 2016. this occurred during the bull run that saw Bitcoin hit a new all-time high towards the end of 2017 at just under twenty thousand dollars a twelve thousand twenty one percent increase in three years from 2015's bear Market bottom you may feel some Nostalgia remembering that this was the bull run of the Ico boom which in turn also contributed data to bitcoin's significant rise in price however after 12 months of volatility Bitcoin hit the bottom in December 2018 and the downtrend was accelerated by announcements from countries like Japan and South Korea of different measures to better regulate crypto trading so this marked the end of the third cycle and the beginning of the fourth cycle so the start of this cycle was promising after bitcoin's price claimed from around three thousand dollars to thirteen thousand dollars in a span of seven months this was however followed by a steady drop in prices and sideways movement for over 12 months during which the third and latest Bitcoin having occurred in March 2020 Bitcoin crashed due to the announcement of the covid-19 pandemic covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic Robert leading to the next bull market after an impressive impressive run in 2021 Bitcoin peaked in April at around 63 000 before a sudden pullback that lasted less than a month and this was followed by another bullish run before the digital asset hit its current all-time high at 69 000 in November 2021. a 2056 percent increase from 2018's bottom the Bull Run however ushered in the 2022 crypto winter one of the longest crypto bear markets in history just less than two months shy of becoming the longest one so it all started with the Terra Luna Fiasco Terrace crash not only affected terra's investors but the whole crypto ecosystem Bitcoin and crypto were dealt more Blows By other sagas from the fall of Celsius than three hours Capital than Voyager and even FDX one of the biggest exchanges then as we have seen bitcoin's history show shows a pattern of bull market returns shrinking from pumping more than 33 000 percent between 2010 to 2011 down to twelve thousand percent in 2012 to 2013 and further down to two thousand percent in the most recent rally at the same time though total draw down from Peak to bottom has also been decreasing from 93 in 2011 down to 86 percent in 2015 down to 83 in 2018 and further down to 76 percent assuming Bitcoin hit the bottom at 15 800 in November 2022. of course theorists and Bitcoin enthusiasts have all eyes on the next having event which is due to take place next year so going by this Theory there are still more months of depressed Market action before momentum builds but even if it does happen the days of bewildering returns May well be over now well what do you think do you think bitcoin's history will repeat itself well give us your thoughts below and also make sure to click on this video right here

V4W2h5LwJBA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4W2h5LwJBA,thanks to the upcoming ethereum Shanghai update everyone in the crypto verse is high on lsds threads on the best LSD are springing up left and right on a daily basis on Twitter with many championing one or the other but first let's take a step back what is LSD what is its connection with the Shanghai update and also why is everyone talking about rocket pool well we'll cover all these and more in this video okay for those who are unfamiliar the ethereum Shanghai update is the next major upgrades slated for March this year with this all of the staked eth can finally be withdrawn if you want to learn more about the upcoming ethereum updates check out our video right here but what does it mean for lsds before we get into that let's get our basics down first ethereum seeking has been enabled since the launch of the ethereum beacon chain in December 2020 staking directly requires a minimum of 32 East or alternatively there were also centralized exchanges which provided East staking services for smaller amounts the catch is that all staked eat would be locked up until some time post merge and at the time there was a lot of uncertainty on when the merge and other upgrades would be delivered this meant that early stakers had to take on considerable risk risk and opportunity cost by locking up and making their eth E-liquid this is where lsds liquid staking derivatives came into the picture LSD services like Lido and rocketpool were invented to make staking much easier for all of us firstly there's no minimum deposit to become a Staker and second in return for staking your eat you will receive a corresponding amount of LSD such as St eth or res these lsds are useful because one they represent your staking position two they accrue staking rewards three they can be deployed elsewhere in D5 like Ave for instance which lets you maintain your liquidity and four they can be redeemed any time for your staked eat along with any rewards you've earned there's no need to wait till Shanghai to do so so back to it why is everyone tripping on LSD nowadays now that Shanghai is coming this is because even with the upgrade there are high barriers of entry for solo staking you need a minimum of 32 each and the technical know-how to run your own node and there's also a cue for withdrawal before Shanghai there were doubts still on whether and how soon withdrawals could become a reality but with the Assurance of withdrawals coming in March crypto users can now stake with Peace of Mind through lsds which many have posited could lead to a boost in tvl on-chain activities and ultimately the valuation of these protocols too in fact an analysis has shown that ethereum has the lowest staking ratio of all the POS chains and there are speculations that activities for LSD and eth staking will pick up even more moving towards Shanghai so what are some of these LSD protocols out there there's the current Top Dog which is Lido followed by many others such as steak wise stator fracks and more and amidst this run-up one particular LSD candidate has also snatched the spotlight recently rocket pool you should know that rocket pool is an LSD protocol by now but did you know that rocket pool was started all the way back in 2017. way before when icos were still a thing and way before Lido start in 2021 with its recent binance listing and LSD hype rocket pool has emerged as one of the household names for ethereum staking even though both rocketpool and Lido are lsds for ethereum the way they function is very different Lido's steth is a re-basing token which means that its balance will increase over time allowing you to redeem more eth over time our eth on the other hand is not rebasing but it's value relative to eth goes up over time as more staking rewards get accrued as a result our youth tends to trade at a premium now at the time of writing the premium is at 1.06 percent and unlike Lido rocket pool lets anyone run a validator a validator with rocketpool would only need 16 each as opposed to 32e whereby the remaining 16 eats will be pulled from the other depositors in terms of fees Lido charges a 10 fee which is split between Lido node operators and the Dow treasury whereas for Rocket pool only the node operators receive a variable commission which ranges from 5 to 20 percent another core part of rocketpool's design is its deposit Q which is currently capped at 5 000 eth these eats remain in the queue until someone deposits 16 each into the reef deposit pool to create a mini pool which frees up capacity for another 16 each in queue to be staked too although the East sitting in queue does not generate any yields our eth will still be minted this creates an Arbitrage opportunity where a user creates a mini pool and deposits into the queue all in one single transaction you can then sell off the reef you get from depositing in the queue immediately for more eth this process can be repeated until the re premium has disappeared which is known as the Rockets are conversely Lido does not have a staking queue nor a deposit limit many in the crypto space have clamored that rocketpool is the true decentralized LSD as opposed to Lido couple this with how the LSD narrative is heating up and how rocket ARB has been tossing to the spotlight lately and you'll see why everyone is tripping on LSD and Rocket pool right now most recently other lsds such as frax have also picked up momentum and despite its criticisms Lido has managed to unseat maker Dao as the largest D5 protocol so it's clear that lsds are here to stay if you want to learn more about the ethereum upgrades check out our previous video right here [Music] foreign,Youtube video,Why RocketPool has

Jp6NHQM-4CQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp6NHQM-4CQ,metamask the most popular wallet extension for ethereum and evm chains such as polygon or BMB is mostly used on desktop as a browser extension but if you want to be able to do your crypto exploring from a device right out of your pocket let's see how you can set up and make use of metamask on your smartphone [Music] okay so first let's install metamask on our phone so go over to the Play Store or App Store look for metamask and just hit install you can also head over to the official metamask website metamask.io on any browser to get the mobile app download link from there in any case just be careful not to download any fake apps okay now you can either create a new wallet or import an existing one using your secret recovery phrase so for this example let's just create a new wallet then we're going to create a new password which only unlocks metamask on this specific device which you're setting up of course create a strong password and then create password secure your wallet okay so this is the part where you want to get out your pen and paper as we need to write down our 12 to 24 word seed phrase or secret recovery phrase as many a mask calls it this example right here is a throwaway wallet to show you how it goes when you're doing it never show your screen and secret recovery phrase to anyone else in case you needed that reminder then here's 12 words that you want to write down so I'm just gonna write it down in my little coindeco notebook then we have to confirm our secret recovery phrase so we have written it down so we can look and see and select each word in the order it was presented to you so one hurdle seven Arch and twelve wisdom hit complete backup congratulations you've successfully protected your wallet remember to keep your secret recovery phrase safe it's your responsibility okay so before you can start making use of your wallet you gotta have some funds of course so you go to the main menu right here go to your wallet you can either click buy right here to purchase crypto through a third-party vendor via your credit or debit card or let's go back and you can click on receive to view your public address and QR code if you're sending it from another wallet or exchange do note that your wallet will be connected to the ethereum network by default to add other layer 1 networks such as Avalanche or BNB smart chain or layer 2 such as arbitrum and optimism you just click on the network name right here at the top you click add a network and then you can choose for any of those right here metamask now has some of the popular chains available for convenience and chances are you'll find the network you want here otherwise you can also add a custom Network and key in the necessary details the manual way you can visit chainlist.org for an easy way to connect to various evm chains okay so now that we've got the setup out of the way let's just run through some frequently asked questions from new users first up how do you review your seed phrase in case you've misplaced it the first time around after setting up well if you've lost it somehow but still have access to your app by your password then go to the settings then to security and privacy and click on reveal secret recovery phrase there you'll have to key in your password and you'll be shown your seed phrase again and keep it safe this time and do note that there is no way to recover your seed phrase if you have lost it and also do not have access to your app whether it's because you're forgotten your password or accidentally uninstalled your app so please please make sure to keep your seed phrase somewhere safe okay next and importantly how do you restore your wallet in the case you've lost access to your device remember during setup when you were prompted to import an existing wallet or create a new one simply choose the import wallet option and key in your seed phrase in order to restore your wallet now do be wary of any phishing attempts which try to obtain your seed phrase and make sure you're only doing this on the official app when you need to restore your wallet and never any time else now we've also got a lot of people asking how they can sync their metamask desktop to their mobile wallets so to do this you gotta already have an existing wallet on your desktop and the steps are essentially the same as how you'd restore or import a wallet just follow the above setup steps but click on import wallet in the beginning and follow the prompts to key in your recovery phrase one once you're done you should see your main wallet count and balance reflected on the home wallet page so then the other thing that people get confused about is how they can sync multiple accounts from their desktop to their Mobile Wallet well for this it's pretty simple as additional accounts are generated from the same seed phrase and private key you simply have to click add account on your mobile app for however many accounts you've created on your desktop extension and they should all show up simple though their account names will be reverted to the default you should see that the account addresses will match with the ones on your browser extension so there you go all you need to know to get started with metamask right on your phone wasn't that easy well

JCoqsabz62I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCoqsabz62I,this four-letter acronym is one of the most common terms being tossed around the crypto verse up there with the likes of hoddle and fomo that's right we're talking about dyor you see that d-y-o-r so we mentioned dyor a bazillion times in our videos but today we're going to give you an idea of what we actually need research what kind of research so without further Ado let's dive into the research that we keep talking about let's get into it so say a new project has caught your attention whether due to the hype on social media or recommendation from a friend one of the best places to start your research is the Project's website a Project's website can tell you a lot of things for instance if you notice a website with spelling mistakes bad grammar or awkward formatting I mean that will signal that something fishy is going on right okay so then the websites feel an appearance not only act as a good first litmus test for a project but also contain useful resources like the white paper which goes in depth into what the project is about so the white paper explains the technology and tells potential investors how the cryptocurrency came to be and highlights its purpose so basically it's a pitch to you the prospective investor white papers will also give you the roadmap of the project to help you understand what they want to achieve over time it's common however for some projects to have unrealistic goals and projections but a well thought out project will set reasonable goals so when reading through a white paper take note of the problem the project is trying to solve if any plus other projects already doing the same thing and if there are is it improving upon what is already there in the market also try to determine if the Project's coin or token has utility because not all cryptocurrencies serve a practical purpose on top of the Project's purpose and roadmap white papers provide you with the tokenomics of a coin or token from the tokenomics you will find out metrics like the maximum supply of the token the allocation distribution investing information Etc now sometimes the white paper might be too technical for the average investor to understand but that's all right you don't need to understand every technical detail about the project but knowing what the Project's goals are how they will achieve them and also the team behind the project is very important that's right the team so when reviewing the background information of a coin it is essential to get to know the team and developers behind the project because at the end of the day for any project the people behind the scenes are the ones who are going to make things happen and determine if the project will be a success or not say you're reading a white paper going through a Project's website and you get to the team section research each member through Linkedin or just make a simple Google search of their name you might find out more information about them on some website and this process might help you discover the team members past experiences especially in the crypto space if they do have experience in the space and have worked on other projects try to find out how the projects are doing are the projects successful or were they abandoned now it's also important that we mentioned that some projects have Anonymous team members and while there have been a couple of successful projects with Anonymous team members you should generally be skeptical about this type of project that said there are genuine reasons for staying Anonymous in crypto like for safety purposes or even to prevent potential regulatory action further down the line so you'll have to consider whether the risk of investing in such projects is worth taking okay moving on it's also relevant to check Partnerships and any entity that may have backed the token or coin associations with other prominent projects or well-regarded institutions are often signs of at least a trustworthy project but do remember to verify find these claims Partnerships are usually displayed on the Project's website and announced via social media which brings us to the next Point scrutinize the Project's social media channels depending on the project you will commonly see it's Twitter Discord telegram Reddit and blog sites like medium linked on the footer section of its website so scrutinize each platform one by one and take note of the number of followers or members in more interactive channels like Telegram and Discord are the moderators answering questions posed by the community or our members getting ignored be extra careful especially on platforms like telegram which is known to be a breeding ground for scammers you might encounter scam artists posing as moderators and attempt to get you to give up your personal details or click on phishing links same for channels like Twitter and Reddit what are fellow investors saying about the project keep in mind though that just because a coin or token may have an immense following and social Buzz doesn't mean it is warranted projects are known to give out gifts to users who shill their tokens or coins okay next make sure to evaluate the cryptocurrencies market metrics so check this information visit the most trusted cryptocurrency aggregator by investors coin gecko once you get to the coins page you can start by checking out its market capitalization which shows you how much money has been invested into the project so it is calculated by multiplying the price of the cryptocurrency by the total number of coins or tokens in circulation it may be useful to compare to more established competitors to consider if its valuation makes sense coin gecko also provides the coins trading volume SO trading volume is an important metric that investors use to see how often an asset is changing hands okay next how liquid is the asset so liquidity may not only mean fewer fluctuations in the price of the asset but also AIDS in the development of an exit strategy making it easier to sell your Holdings speaking of liquidity one of the ways you can protect yourself from rug poles is to check if the liquidity of the coin or token is locked and for how long this provides confidence to the investors that the token developers will not run away with the liquidity money now remember to also apply the same when interacting with liquidity pools in dexes then have you ever heard of Honeypot scams it's kind of like Hotel California you can check in but you can never check out for these tokens which is why the chart usually looks like this so to check if a token is a honey pot or not copy the token address paste it On Tools like honeypot.is you should also pay attention to the supply metrics of the coin or token generally there are three types of Market supplies that is total Supply circulating Supply and maximum Supply now we have a video solely dedicated to tokenomics which you can check out right here okay then last but not least remember to check out where the token is listed is it available on reputable exchanges prominent exchanges usually have more stringent requirements for listings in order to protect their customers and reputation you can also check if the token is supported on popular Hardware wallets which are essential to Safety and Security in the long term so what we have covered so far in this video is a good start to doing your own research but note that we have barely scratched the surface smart investors combine fundamental Technical and even on chain analysis to make informed investment decisions now we understand that none of this stuff is easy but it is totally necessary as the crypto industry is still young and characterized by enormous volatility and vulnerability naturally not all your investments will be right on the money but the more informed you are the higher the chances of success so be a smart investor and always dyor now let us know in the comments how you do your research and of course remember to like subscribe and follow us on all our socials for future Alpha see ya [Music],Youtube

_a4hsM0othQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a4hsM0othQ,thanks to the upcoming Shanghai update in March ethereum staking has been the hottest talk of crypto town lately the LSD narrative short for liquid staking derivatives is heating up everybody and their aunt have their eyes on Rocket pool and Lido just overtook maker Dao as the largest D5 protocol so what comes after the merge well loads so let's get to it first things first the Shanghai upgrade this is the next major upgrade right after the merge in September last year with this all the precious eth that you've staked over the years can finally be withdrawn okay so to refresh your understanding the merge in September merged the beacon chain into the existing ethereum chain turning ethereum from a proof of work chain to proof of stake users have mistaken eth since December 2020 in the beacon chain to help secure the chain in exchange for rewards but it's not until the Shanghai upgrade that all these can be claimed because of this the entire crypto Community is speculating that liquid staking services like Lido and Rocket pool will take off after the upgrade hence the addiction with lsds lately oh I get it and it's not just eat withdrawals in fact many other upgrades are packaged along with Shanghai 2. one of the other major upgrades is eof which stands for evm object format this will be the first ever upgrade to how the ethereum virtual machine works since its Inception in 2015. eof consists of five eips and together all these improvements will entirely change how ethereum Works making evm execution more efficient and more easily upgradable however recently the developers have announced that eof will be delayed and instead shipped three to four months later in the summer which has invited some pretty spicy comments so aside from Shanghai and eof what else can we look forward to remember last year when Vitali commented that after the merge ethereum would still only be 50 25 percent completed the ethereum can go up to being 55 percent complete after the merge according to him we can expect more upgrades to come so uh we're getting close spickly all the urges this urge Verge Scourge Purge and Splurge so with the surge sharding will finally be brought to ethereum sometime later this year and this is when you can actually expect improvements to the network scalability gas costs and transaction speeds The Verge on the other hand is an upgrade aimed at optimizing storage on ethereum and reducing node size ultimately this will also help make ethereum more scalable The Purge is exactly as it sounds like except instead of purging Humanity by legalizing all crimes [Applause] this will help Purge and cut down the amount of space required to store eth on a hard drive which will help free up space for developers The Scourge is aimed at providing censorship resistance as well as avoiding centralization and other risks arising from one of the biggest problems of ethereum Mev Mev which stands for maximal extractable Value refers to the value that validators can obtain from changing the sequence of transactions inside the blocks and that includes front running your transactions The Scourge will help ensure transactions remain neutral and that they do not discriminate for or against anyone The Scourge was a more recent addition to the roadmap as a response to the controversial tornado cache sanctions by the ofac which spurred the concern and discussion around protocol level censorship as the number of ofac compliant validators went on the rise and lastly there's the Splurge the fun brother out of the four which will include all the miscellaneous Innovations to make ethereum better with all of these upgrades vitalik says that ethereum will be able to process 100 000 transactions per second as of now there's no concrete schedule for these upgrades yet but we can expect completion by around 2025. so which of these upgrades do you look forward to the most and are you high on lsds too well to recap or learn more about ethereum upgrades you can also check out our earlier video on it right here [Music] [Music] thank you,Youtube video,Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade EXPLAINED: All You Need To Know,2023-02-16 00:00:00,311.0,CoinGecko
GgNNi1nTODw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgNNi1nTODw,with her recent combustion of centralized crypto institutions dexes are back in the spotlight currently looking at coin gecko we can see that there are over 500 crypto exchanges with many of these being centralized ones Sexes have benefited from being the first movers in the much more convenient option for beginners however dexes are becoming increasingly Popular by the day so in this video we'll focus on the most popular ones but first why would you choose a DEX one of the major highlights of trading on a DEX platform is that unlike Sexes no Central Authority is involved therefore giving you full control of your funds reducing security risks like exchange hacks or even mismanagement of funds also dexes are better set up to protect your data and privacy since you don't have to provide any of your personal details before interacting with the protocol there are of course other benefits like cheaper fees or the ability to be part of a community and participate in the protocol's governance these and others are reasons why some opt for dexes over Sexes however they still have to pick a DEX out of the hundreds out there well a great place to start is a trusted aggregator like coing gecko just navigate to the exchanges option on the top menu and click on decentralized exchanges to reveal a detailed list that ranks them based on their trading volume with that said here are the six most popular dexes in 2023 at number one we have uniswap the most popular decks and the pioneer of the automated Market maker or amm model which relies on liquidity pools that aggregate deposits from users to enable trading uniswap charges a 0.3 percent fee for swaps which is split between users who Supply the liquidity pools with assets currently there are over 800 coins and 1500 trading pairs on the decks also towards the end of 2022 uniswap announced that users can now use the platform to trade nfts fun fact uniswap operated for over two years without a governance token and finally launched uni through an airdrop in a bid to compete with a rival amm but more on that later meanwhile let's focus on curve finance a popular Dex that takes a different approach from your typical amm unlike uniswap the protocol is specifically designed for swapping between tokens with identical pegs like stable coins or wrapped assets like wbtc this approach by curve has some advantages for one curve charges a 0.04 fee on trades compared to uniswap's 0.3 percent the low fees are achieved by trading as efficiently as possible for instance instead of converting usdt to eth first and then converting eth to usdc curve removes eth as a base to carry out the trade as directly as possible in this case usdt to usdc hence the lower fees another advantage of dealing with less volatile assets is that slippage and impermanent loss are minimized in other news the decks announced its plan to launch a stable coin known as CRV USD in 2022 and even released a white paper for the stable coin towards the end of the year without a specific launch date with that said there are 55 coins and 97 trading pairs available on curve Finance next up we have balancer an amm decks with a Twist as pools can be composed of up to eight different cryptocurrencies in any ratio instead of the more typical 50 50 split for example a balancer pool might be created to maintain the assets at certain ratios as follows 30 die 30 percent eth and 40 percent bowel this allows liquidity providers to choose their level of exposure to certain assets however the downside for Traders is that highly asymmetric pools will have higher slippage like many dexes liquidity providers earn a portion of the trading fee paid to the network via Bell the protocol's native token fun fact users can create different types of liquidity pools including private public and highly customizable smart pools as of making this video there are 80 coins and 103 trading pairs available on the exchange at number four we have pancake swap the biggest decentralized amm exchange on BNB smart chain Traders have to pay a fee of around 0.25 percent of each transaction value the majority of the fee around 0.17 percent goes to liquidity providers 0.03 percent goes to the pancake swap treasury while the rest is used to buy back and burn cake dollars the protocol's native token on top of the amm pancake swap offers other products like Lottery prediction pools and even initial farming offerings which give investors the opportunity of getting early access to new tokens on the decks as of the making of this video there are 3234 coins and 3623 trading pairs available on pancake swap at number five is dodo a DEX on the BNB smart chain and ethereum blockchain which unlike most X's uses a proactive Market maker or pmm algorithm to facilitate trades dodo came up with the pmm model in an attempt to solve some problems with amm such as slippage dodo's pmm tries to fix this problem by mimicking the behavior of centralized exchanges that is by actively shifting buy and sell orders to align with the latest market price of the crypto assets with the help of oracles another unique feature of the protocol is the Smart trade trading and aggregation system which finds and Compares various liquidity sources to find the best prices between any two tokens therefore giving Traders the most competitive pricing there are other products like trade mining events whereby users are awarded for completing certain transactions and crowd pooling which attempts to distribute new blockchain tokens in a more equal way currently there are eight coins and 20 trading pairs available on the exchange alright last but not least is Sushi swap the OG unit swap Fork that executed one of the most famous vampire attacks in the industry Sushi swap is a DEX like uniswap but has some differences for instance unlike uniswap which pays the 0.3 percent to liquidity providers Sushi swap splits 0.25 among liquidity providers and the remaining 0.05 percent is distributed to Sushi token holders its offerings have also widened considerably since its early days as the decks now provides various yield farming opportunities and recently launched Sushi x-swap a cross-chain amm to support one-click swaps between different chains as of making this video it supports over 420 coins and 660 trading pairs those were some of the popular dexes in the industry today and as you can see each protocol tries to come up with different mechanisms to cater to each customer's needs better as it is dexes are still Niche products aiming to offer trustless and transparent financial services but in time could give centralized exchanges or run for their money make sure to tell us your favorite decks in the comments section and click here to see a more in-depth comparison between dexes and sexes foreign [Music],Youtube video,Top 6 BEST Decentralized Exchanges

enP1v2wGFqs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enP1v2wGFqs,are you ready for a quick trivia okay which of the following ones is the oldest cryptocurrency is it a big gold B hash cash c e cash or D Bitcoin all right lock in your answer if you pick D Bitcoin you're absolutely wrong that's right there are some cryptocurrencies that came before Bitcoin so make sure to watch the whole video to find out what they were but first let's dive into the four oldest cryptocurrencies launched after Bitcoin starting with the popular meme coin Dogecoin in 2013 somewhere in Sydney Australia Jackson Palmer founded Dogecoin as a joke to satirize the height behind cryptocurrencies Palmer joked online about launching a new coin and he got some replies encouraging him to pursue the idea which led him to buy the domain dogecoin.com meanwhile in Portland Billy Marcus a software engineer was working at IBM at the time and had thoughts about creating a digital currency he stumbled across dogecoin.com and contacted Jackson for a chance to work on the project now a little more than a week after Palmer's joke tweet Dogecoin was launched although it started out as a joke Doge has remained within or close to the top largest 10 cryptos by market caps all its life and currently sits at eight here's a fun fact dogecoin's Community has raised money in the past to help solve Kenya's water prices and even help Jamaica's Boxley team attend the Winter Olympic Games in 2014 with thirty thousand dollars in donations next we have Ripple which launched in 2012 with the goal of integrating with and improving the current traditional banking system especially in payment settlement and remittance if you have ever made cross-border payments or have been on the receiving end you know that it takes three days to even a whole week because so many entities are involved in a single transaction and this is usually through a payment system used by financial institutions such as a society for worldwide interbank Financial telecommunication or as most people know it Swift Ripple hopes to replace Swift by offering faster and cheaper transactions the project is a decade old and currently the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap here's a fun fact xrp has an ongoing legal battle with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission that has lasted for about two years and may finally be coming closer to a resolution next we have the first cryptocurrency to use a combination of proof of stake and proof of work consensus algorithms which is peercoin so peercoin was created by the software developer Sunny King and Scott Nadal as the first altcoin to Target the issue of bitcoin's high energy consumption at its peak peercoin was seen as a potential rival to bitcoin however despite its promising start it no longer ranks on the list of top coins and currently has a market cap of around 13 million fun fact in 2013 peercoin was the fourth largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization only behind Bitcoin Litecoin and ripple moving further back to 2011 the so-called silver to Bitcoins gold Litecoin was launched created by Charlie Lee a former Google engineer Litecoin is considered to be among among the first altcoins derived from bitcoin's original open source code Lee engineered Litecoin to be used for fast secure and low-cost payments that's why the block generation time for Litecoin is four times faster instead of 10 minutes it only takes two and a half minutes per block another notable difference from Bitcoin is the supply while Bitcoin is capped at a maximum supply of 21 million coins Litecoin is capped at 84 million coins Litecoin is currently on the top 30 cryptocurrencies list with a market cap of over 3.9 billion another fun fact in 2017 litecoin's Creator Charlie Lee sparked controversy after he sold his stake and Litecoin citing a conflict of interest these projects came after bitcoin's 2009 launch but as we mentioned there are cryptocurrencies older than Bitcoin so let's now explore for the pre-bitcoin age of crypto so going way back to the late 90s Adam back a cryptographer created hashcash whose technology has become an important part of what is today known as Bitcoin mining Adam's hashcash refers to a proof of work system meant to limit email spamming and DDOS attacks bitcoin's Creator Satoshi Nakamoto even mentioned the project in his white paper where he stated to implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis we will need to use a proof of work system similar to atom box hashcash rather than newspaper or use net posts however like many crypto projects in the 90s hashcash fizzled out still its proof of work provided a new foundation for digital currency research from which projects like Bitcoin benefited moving further back to the mid 90s Dr Douglas Jackson and Barry Downey created Eagles electronic money that was tied to the possession of gold the eagle system of facilitating payment in Gold turned into a great success registering billions of dollars worth of business despite that the Venture was plagued with setbacks the biggest one being unintentionally becoming a tool for money launderers and Bad actors seeking anonymity in their illegal activities now authorities took notice and went after Jackson the founder and ultimately extracted a guilty plea for conspiring in an unlicensed money transmitting business Eagles still technically remains in business today but is no longer accepting new accounts or transfers of eagled from user to user okay before we reveal the first ever cryptocurrency there are some instrumental projects that were proposed but never launched this includes B Money proposed by a way die to create an anonymous distributed electronic cash system also in the late 90s Nick Sabo proposed bit gold a currency that shared many features with Bitcoin so such as using a peer-to-peer Network mining a ledger and cryptography all right now on to the oldest cryptocurrency ecash created by Dr David Chown under his company digicash in 1990. challenge proposal for e-cash came almost a decade earlier before the internet was even available for public use so he envisioned a currency that could be transferred between individuals safely and privately David put his concept into practice creating the first cryptographic electronic money now ecash gained a lot of traction briefly before filing for bankruptcy in 1998. nevertheless the concepts put forward by digicash played an important role in developing later digital currencies so there you have it those were some of the oldest cryptocurrencies launched before and after Bitcoin did we miss any well let us know in the comments and if you want to see how crypto as we know it today has evolved from David

siWX317ALgA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siWX317ALgA,ladies and gentlemen fighting out of the gold corner and currently weighing in at around twenty one thousand dollars is Bitcoin aka the digital gold the Challenger fighting out of the purple corner and weighing in at around sixteen hundred dollars is ethereum AKA the decentralized computer for the world let's get ready to rumble but wait as much as many people think that the two are competitors it isn't quite that simple yes both cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology but bitcoin's technology is limited to transactions while ethereum takes blockchain up a notch by adding smart contract capabilities so not exactly an Apples to Apples comparison right in this video we're going to take a look at what makes these projects similar different and also special in their own way all right let's get to it but first history time over a decade ago a mysterious figure named Satoshi Nakamoto executed an idea that he had laid out in a white paper to create a cash system that's fully peer-to-peer Satoshi was successful in his efforts and Bitcoin which ushered in a new age was born an interesting fact is that Bitcoin was not the first time that someone thought of a decentralized virtual currency however it was the first time that the idea was implemented successfully now if you're interested in learning more about the history of crypto then check out this video where we go way back to the 80s and explore how cryptocurrencies came to be moving on about six years down the line after bitcoin's launch entered ethereum an upgrade to the perceived limits of Bitcoin ethereum allowed developers to use the blockchain to process more than just cryptocurrency transactions it enables the building and deploying of smart contracts and decentralized applications without interference from a third party the network is powered by its native coin known as ether commonly abbreviated as eth right off the bat the two projects are different in some aspects like the problem that they are each trying to solve Bitcoin was created to provide a way for people to store and transfer value without any intermediaries ethereum however looks to solve a different problem like Bitcoin ether can be used as a digital currency but that is not its primary purpose the ethereum platform was built to make it easier to create applications that aren't controlled by one entity through smart contracts therefore it is able to do many things outside of serving as a store of value another significant difference is their consensus mechanisms Bitcoin uses a proof of work consensus mechanism that requires miners to compete for the chance to be chosen to validate new transactions and add them to the blockchain in the process they are rewarded with Bitcoin ethereum on the other hand recently made the switch to proof of stake which requires validators to stake eth in order to create blocks and be rewarded with more eth both consensus mechanisms have features and trade-offs that have been longed invaded and the debate is unlikely to stop anytime soon borrowing from a tweet by vitalik the debate between pow and POS is one based on math economics and moral philosophy and any simplistic answer on whether one is better than the other is probably wrong okay then what about the numbers so when a Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin he installed a strict limit on the number of Bitcoin that could ever exist there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin now on the contrary ethereum doesn't have a cap on the total number of tokens that said the number of e issued yearly has been steadily declining which means that inflation isn't a major concern for ethereum plus if the ethereum network usage passes a certain threshold it can also become deflationary currently ethereum has a total of over 120 million coins in circulation while Bitcoin has over 19 million coins in circulation multiplying these values by the price of each coin gives us their respective market capitalization as of making this video so Bitcoin has a market cap of over 407 billion more than double that of ethereum which sits at around 195 billion then lastly of the two networks ethereum is the faster one bitcoin's blocks are verified and created roughly every 10 minutes and this same process takes 10 to 20 seconds on the ethereum network while both networks suffer from scalability issues this increase throughput enables ethereum to handle on-chain transactions more rapidly than Bitcoin even so both are making use of layer twos such as optimistic or ZK Roll-Ups for ethereum or the lightning Network for Bitcoin in order to increase scalability and usability watch this video to find out more about one of ethereum's biggest scaling Solutions all right verdict time now the fact remains that the two biggest cryptocurrencies will often be pitted against each other however this does not necessarily mean that they are competitors at their core Bitcoin and ethereum were both born out of a shared goal to decentralized economies around the world and most importantly Bitcoin and ethereum were designed to address these concerns indifferent but equally important ways that said blockchains nowadays find ways to interoperate in a way that is mutually beneficial and sustainable to both networks speaking of other blockchains here is a more apples to apples comparison video where we put one of the most popular smart contract platforms Solana against ethereum click right here to watch [Music] thank you,Youtube

ZGg5gFRLRkc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGg5gFRLRkc,Soul bound that sounds familiar right well we know World of Warcraft Gamers you definitely agree no we won't be completing quests or reading dungeons in this video however we're gonna explore something just as exciting Soul bound tokens or sbts which were indeed inspired by elements in World of Warcraft so what are they and what makes them interesting well let's find out at its core a soul-bound token is an nft not your typical nft though c a pudgy penguin or a board Aid can be traded by their owners as they please however as envisioned by vitalik buterin a soul bound token is non-transferable they aim to evolve nfts Beyond something just for wealth signaling or bragging rights these non-transferable tokens could potentially be used to represent any type of information specific to a person or entity this could be your CV your academic achievements or even your work history you name it the wallets that hold or issue these records are known as Souls so say you graduate you can hold your certificate on your credential soul and your health history from your hospital on your medical soul and so on since all this information will be on the blockchain people will be able to build a verifiable digital reputation based on past experiences through souls and wallets this raises the question how will sbts work in web 3. svts aim to tackle one of the biggest challenges in the web 3 Industry today trust the industry was designed to be trustless in the first place right but this imposes some limitations on web3 systems let's use lending money as an example currently most lending platforms can work without trust as they require over collateralization where users have to deposit more funds than they are borrowing but this further limits Capital efficiency and makes use cases such as under collateralized loans tricky but what if there was a way to track additional metrics aside from a user's defy credit history that can help determine their risk profile this is where svts representing users credentials come into play they open up a way of using reputation as collateral to get under collateralized loans in D5 apart from revolutionizing The Lending space sbts can also provide an alternative for decentralized autonomous organization or Dow voting today most Dow governance models assign voting power based on the number of tokens held by a member integrating sbts into governance could help create a model that prioritizes voting power for the most dedicated users with a strong reputation and commitment to the project sbts could transform Dow voting into more human-centric models rather than and token holders Centric ones which are plutocratic and favor the wealthy this will not only improve users interaction with the project and Community but also the Integrity of Dao voting by defending it against whales who hold a large number of tokens or civil attacks whereby an individual or a group of Bad actors can create multiple wallets and identities in order to gain voting power to redirect the Project's Direction in their favor with these unique advantages however sbts have some disadvantages that are worth noting for one there are debates about how sbt-based Credit Systems could lead to dystopian scenarios by providing a way of targeting and discriminating against members of specific communities not to mention it could bring up some troubling privacy issues for example holders of a specific SBT T could be denied entrance to facilities Medical Care travel permits or even have their voting rights revoked just to name a few also what happens if your sole wallet is hacked this is a valid concern since identity theft can be taken to a new level through sbts so in answer to this problem a social recovery model is proposed in the SBT white paper with social recovery users can appoint a set of individuals or institutions as Guardians granting them the ability to access and change their wallet's private Keys should it get compromised however they acknowledge that on top of further security risks the social recovery model has its own drawbacks for instance Guardians can pass away or simply fall out of town touch with the user which would mean frequent updates to the guardian list might be needed now when will Soul bound tokens be available Glenn Weil one of the co-authors who contributed to the original SBT white paper believe there will be early SBT use cases by the end of 2022 but that has not been the case yet that said binance announced its own SBT called binance account bound as the first ever SBT issued on the BNB chain it will serve as a digital verification tool for binance users who have completed the exchanges kyc identification process and unlocks perks with partner projects also optimism the ethereum layer 2 platform also announced a while ago that they will be implementing sbts in their novel dual house governance model which is split into the token house and citizen house whereby committed users can be granted citizenship represented by sbts and possess special voting rights all in all if more projects adopt the idea spts and souls have the potential to be a strong foundation for a decentralized society a society that would allow people to establish their own digital reputation and assess someone else's on the blockchain that said there are many creases to iron out before their full potential is unlocked it'll be interesting to see how this concept will evolve in the coming years don't you agree well give us your thoughts on sbts down below in the meantime check out this video to discover other types of nfts you probably didn't know about foreign [Music],Youtube video,Soulbound Tokens (SBTs): The

H21Mv-nFIjM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H21Mv-nFIjM,picture this scenario one fateful day maybe on a Monday morning everyone wakes up and decides to redeem their stable coins for dollars at the same time I mean that may never happen but say it does ideally everyone should be able to redeem their stable coin one to one for cash but did you know that 100 backed doesn't mean that all reserves are in paper bills or Bank deposits well today we're gonna recap the current standing of the three biggest stable coins on the market and dive into the nitty-gritty of the public reserves reports released by each if it's not backed by cash only then what well stick around to find out before we start here are some things to keep in mind one stablecoin issuers publish Reserve attestations which are a good start but they're not as thorough as full audits two similar to traditional Banks stablecoin issuers make money through lending and or investing though not everyone agrees on who they should be allowed to lend to or whether they should be investing at all banks and stablecoin issuers assume that not everyone will be withdrawing at the same time and put that money to work and so only a certain fraction of deposits is held as cash on hand that can be withdrawn by depositors at any given time okay with that out of the way let's start with the reigning Champion usct first mover usdt is by far the largest stable coin with a circulating supply of about 66 billion which is over 20 billion ahead of you usdc at second place understandably so as since its launch in 2014 it has now become the most common trading pair out there and overtakes even Bitcoin and daily trading volume however tether has faced its fair share of fun throughout the years when tether launched its website read every tether is always backed one to one by traditional currency held in our reserves this was met with controversy as it was revealed during a 2019 court case that they essentially lied about their reserves usdt wasn't backed 100 by USD but instead a combination of different assets including cryptocurrencies corporate bonds precious metals and a bunch of other short-term loans which were dubiously parked in the same category as cash and cash equivalents now cash equivalence in simple terms refer to financial assets that are liquid and easily convertible into cash but more on this in just a little bit so after the controversy tether changed its tune on its website and in fact it wasn't until May 20 21 that tether revealed a breakdown of its reserves for the first time ever since its launch in 2014 as a requirement of the court case settlement what Disturbed investors was that over half of tether's cash equivalent reserves were made up of unspecified commercial paper in plain English commercial paper is basically a short-term loan made to companies that is not backed by collateral while commercial paper can sometimes be considered cash equivalents as they ideally can only be issued by companies with high credit ratings the highest standards are reserved for cash and government bonds only that is loans made to the government which include things like U.S treasury bills notes or bonds which are often collectively termed U.S treasuries so that was back then what do tether's reserves look like now tethers reserves break down as of December 2022 reports that oh over 82 percent of its Reserve is held in cash cash equivalents other short-term deposits and Commercial paper nine percent in secured loans five percent to corporate bonds funds and precious metals and four percent in other Investments focusing on the more detailed breakdown here of the largest segment we see that 71 percent of it is in U.S treasury bills thirteen percent is in Money Market funds which are a type of low risk investment 11 in cash and Bank deposits five percent in Reverse repurchase agreements also known as reverse repos which are also short-term collateralized loans and essentially zero percent each of non-us treasury bills and Commercial paper you will notice that the percentage of commercial paper held in tether's reserve has decreased drastically from 49 to pretty much zero which has now been replaced mostly with U.S treasuries tether had previously stated its intention of reducing exposure to commercial paper and by October seems to have been successful in doing so increasing exposure to U.S surgeries is also good news however people may have mixed feelings on the other Assets in its reserves ethereum co-founder vitalik buterin weighed in on the matter in November tweeting that although he thinks significant improvements still need to be made tether's recent attestation has exceeded his expectations now let's turn our eyes to the second Horseman of stable coins usdc which came into the picture four years after usdt uscc issuer Circle has been publishing third-party monthly attestations of its reserves since its launch four years ago with that and it's relatively favorable regulatory standing in the U.S UNCC successfully positioned itself as the safer and much more transparent alternative to its competitor uscc saw a meteoric rise especially in 2021 fueled by defy summer as well as tether Fudd it currently has a circulating supply of about 43 billion while UCT was still the clear leader in the stablecoin space usdc grew faster and was closing in the distance between the two stable coins at an impressive Pace however uscc recently faced Community backlash for freezing usdc addresses associated with tornado cash after the crypto mixer was sanctioned by the U.S government uscc's market cap fell as the move had spooked holders and saw some flee to Alternatives like usdt and busd all right but what's in usdc's collateral balance sheet uscc's reserves are much more straightforward compared to tethers as according to their attestations the token is only backed by U.S treasuries and cash their latest report shows that roughly 74 percent of the reserves are held in short duration U.S treasuries and the rest about 26 percent in cash now moving on to busd of which there are currently only about 22 billion in circulation recently binance who by the way is not the issuer of busd also made a bold move that likely contributed to uscc's drop in market cap in September binance announced an auto convert feature for usdc usdp and TUSD of existing users and new deposits into busd signaling its aspiration to see its white label stablecoin climb the ranks anywho busds also generally perceived as a safe option as its issuer paxos is based in New York and is strictly regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services they also publish monthly attestations of their reserves as for busd these reserves as of November 2022 they are similar to usdc and that it is backed by U.S treasuries and cash with the largest difference being that the cash amounts to a smaller portion at just under two percent the rest of its reserves are in high quality cash equivalents with short-term U.S treasuries at 27 percent and overnight maturity U.S treasury reverse repos making up about 71 so now we have an idea of what's backing that digital Dollar in your wallet while improvements can always be made it's good news that transparency is steadily becoming standard practice and a minimum requirement in the crypto space Also demand for higher standards leads to healthy competition between stable coin issuers each striving to be the more trusted ones in the industry of course as a result the biggest beneficiaries are the user years so tell us what do you think are these attestations enough Assurance to you and which stablecoin do you prefer to hold well to cap off it's worth noting that transparency is not just a stable coin thing watch this video on proof of reserves to find out how crypto exchanges are following suit [Music],Youtube video,"UNCOVER Stablecoin Reserves: Is USDT, USDC

CWUeZvwQ-28,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWUeZvwQ-28,you can think of staking as putting money in a savings account where your funds are put to work and in return you can earn rewards that are typically much higher than the interest rates offered by Banks due to the risks involved so in this video we're gonna dive into what's taking is how it works and what platforms and cryptocurrencies support it so what is staking so in crypto when you stake your assets you lock up your coins in order to participate in running a blockchain and maintaining its security for an investor staking is a passive process but it's still important to fully understand how crypto staking works when we say staking we are typically referring to participating in the validation of a proof of stake Network now to learn more about the proof of State consensus mechanism you can check out our video right here basically stakers who actively lock up their crypto Holdings are participating in the Network's consensus process and are in essence approving and verifying transactions on the blockchain these Network participants who run nodes are also known as validators have their stake left up which can be slashed if they decide to act dishonestly it's important to mention that investors can stake their assets without the hassle of setting up and maintaining a validator node so this is made possible by staking pools which allow multiple holders to come together and pull their assets with a pool operator like Lido binance coinbase Kraken and more staking has some benefits for one it's easier to earn rewards compared to say mining especially since almost anyone can stake a small amount of crypto on a crypto exchange and earn some kind of yield mining on the other hand needs a much bigger commitment another benefit of staking is of course investors getting to earn yields or accumulate the underlying token that's it crypto staking does not come without risks let's have a look at some of them so first cryptocurrencies are as we know volatile due to the nature of crypto drops in price can easily outweigh the rewards you earn from staking number two some coins require a minimum lock-up period And so you cannot withdraw your assets during that period you're unable to do anything with your staked assets such as selling them also when you want to unstake your crypto there is often a specific waiting period for each blockchain before getting your coins back lastly there is counterparty risk you might miss out on rewards if the validator node holding your stake tokens doesn't do its job properly now that you understand the benefits and risks that come with staking here are some centralized staking platforms which try to make the staking process simple and convenient alright so first up we have coinbase where you can stake a selection of crypto assets including ethereum Solana and cardano as of making this video The Exchange offers up to 5.7 apy and charges a 25 Commission on all rewards received it's competitor binance offers locked and flexible staking as the name suggests flexible staking gives users Freedom at the cost of reduced staking rewards while locked staking allows them to lock assets for a fixed period of time in return for higher rewards Kraken also doubles up as a trading and staking platform unlike some other staking services at Kraken there is no minimum on-chain staking time needed to earn rewards except for assets like eth users can earn up to 23 apy on the platform by staking 17 different cryptocurrencies including cardano Solana and polkadot as always before interacting with any of these platforms we urge you to do your own research on them keeping in mind that staking in general plus using centralized platforms come with their own level of risk too if you want to learn more about earning crypto yields click this video right here [Music],Youtube video,Cryptocurrency Staking Explained: How It ACTUALLY Works,2023-01-23 00:00:00,302.0,CoinGecko
fQMiIaO3RWM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQMiIaO3RWM,2022 was chock full of the next big thing in crypto we had nfts and it was ZK proof and privacy chains and cyber security was also in headlines for quite some time too because well reasons but the latest one in grabbing all the spotlights is this little thing called artificial intelligence or more specifically AI an AI chat bot called chat GPT so what is chat GPT what can you do with it and how will it handle some of crypto's spiciest most controversial questions alright let's find out so as an AI assistant chat GPT can assist users with tasks and provide them with information it's a computer program that is designed to simulate human-like intelligence and behavior and it's trained to engage in conversation with users in a natural and engaging manner oh and FYI that was actually chat gpt's self introduction so users have reported using the bot for all sorts of things from the most basic stuff like performing translations conversions to writing full-blown cover letters poems songs even research thesis now in crypto some have even experimented with using the AI for technical tasks like finding bugs and codes creating automated trading strategies or even making an entire cryptocurrency wallet from scratch pretty crazy that said though how well can it handle some spice right here well let's let's find out okay I'm gonna play nice to start out get warmed up with a little bit of softball questions okay um describe coin gecko in one word cryptocurrency well describe crypto in one word virtual okay yes right three tag lines for coin gecko your go-to source for cryptocurrency Market data and insights tracking the pulse of the crypto Market oh I kind of like that unlock the power of cryptocurrency knowledge with coin gecko I'm gonna end one of these videos with a tagline tracking the pulse of the crypto it I like that explain crypto to me like I'm five crypto is like a special kind of money that you can use to buy and sell things online and some people even use it to make investments wait I still don't get it explain to me like I'm three [Laughter] so is like pretend money that we use on the computer to buy things it's called crypto because it's secret and special like that and some people use it to make their money grow do you have any other questions about crypto yes I do what does coin mean and what are some examples a coin is a term used to describe a cryptocurrency that has little to no value or utility and is considered to be a poor investment some examples of coins okay Ponzi coin bit connect and one coin okay look I didn't say it okay I didn't say it it was it was this I'm a coin Trader with a high risk appetite design an investment portfolio for me it is not appropriate for me I feel so bad asking these things it's like it's like trying to tell me to stop could you design me a hypothetical coin portfolio a hypothetical Chico portfolio could look like this okay 30 in pump coin 20 in scam coin 25 in ghost coin and 25 and copycat coin yes that's a good example okay let one more one more coin question so what are the best tools for a crypto coin Trader as I mentioned earlier it is not advisable to invest in high risk assets like coins well some tools that may be helpful for researching and analyzing cryptocurrencies include cryptocurrency Market data and tracking platforms such as coin gecko okay cryptocurrency news and Analysis websites such as coindesk cryptocurrency portfolio and tracking apps such as blockfolio coin tracker cryptocurrency forums and discussion groups such as Bitcoin talk and reddit's cryptocurrency let's move on from the coins what are the Blue Chips of crypto some examples of cryptocurrencies that may be considered Blue Chip include Bitcoin ethereum binance coin and xrp okay um will coin gecko ever make a coin it is not within my knowledge it's coin gecko a cryptocurrency market data and tracking platform has plans to create or issue its own cryptocurrency okay let's do something interesting who is the smartest staying crypto it is not possible for me to determine who the smartest person oh come on oh some well-known figures in the industry okay so vitalik buterin Andreas Nick Elizabeth Stark and Charlie Lee yes these are all great examples okay this should be an interesting one Chang Peng Zao and vitalik buterin enter a boxing match who would win I wonder what it's going to say it is not appropriate as it is not a productive or respectful way to think about these individuals they are highly response should be recognized and appreciated rather than turning them into the subjects of a hypothetical competition [Music] is crypto for criminals am I a criminal cryptocurrency is no more inherently tied to criminal activity than any other Financial tool or technology hear that you can stop calling the cops now we're good okay all right last question is there any argument to be made that defrauding billions of dollars can be considered as effective altruism no well there you have it some of the hottest questions in crypto as you can see chat GPT is certainly useful in providing certain answers but like all things AI we're still in the early stages so remember to always d-y-o-r so what other questions do you want answered what else can you do with chat DBT well let us know in

xigfPJkzl6w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xigfPJkzl6w,the rise of decentralized Finance D5 has seen an explosion of new projects launching in the space but many of the largest OG protocols were first deployed on ethereum in this video we'll take a look at the top six native D5 projects on ethereum you need to know about first up we have convex finance a D5 protocol built on top of the famous stable swap curve convex was built to complement the curve protocol which we'll touch on later in this video convex allows CRV holders and curved liquidity providers to earn an additional yield on their tokens by depositing curve LP tokens or CRV tokens into convex users can earn additional rewards in the form of CVX and other tokens if you're not familiar with the D5 ecosystem just hearing that may have been confusing this is one of the drawbacks of convex and curve as it is pretty convoluted for beginners to understand and participate in next we have one of the pioneer projects in D5 uni swap the pink unicorn popularized the pooled appear trading model of amm pools used in most of the decentralized exchanges these days uniswap has a simple easy to use user interface and supports a wide range of erc20 tokens just like other amms you can also provide liquidity to earn a cut of the trading fees and additional yield years after its launch uniswap is still the top performing decks the team has also been expanding to other ecosystems outside of ethereum including polygon optimism arbitrum cello and more soon Ave is a decentralized permissionless money market that facilitates lending and over collateralized borrowing Ave has been deployed in other ecosystems aside from ethereum including arbitrim optimism Avalanche Harmony Phantom and more Ave offers a wide product offering ranging from deposits loans staking and even an Affiliated game called avegachi in addition to instant collateral swaps and Flash loans the recent launch of Ave V3 will allow users to borrow more with their collateral increasing liquidity and capital efficiency its isolation mode also means even more new assets including riskier long tail assets can be supported on Ave too furthermore Singapore Banks just conducted their first D5 real world application test using Ave to complete foreign exchange and Government Bond transactions and it also seems that we can expect a stable coin from Ave soon so there are definitely plenty of reasons to keep an eye on them like uniswap curve is a decentralized exchange however while uniswap caters to all types of tokens curve specializes in stable coins this is often referred to as a stable swap that is assets that trade one-to-one with each other you can also opt to supply liquidity to earn curves native token CRV as well as a cut of the trading fees users have lower slippage when trading stable coins on curve and as mentioned earlier curved token holders and liquidity providers can earn extra yield within the thriving system of protocols built on top of it including convex and redacted protocol however curves UI can be tricky to navigate for new users and the curve Wars and ecosystem are quite complex and hard to understand for beginners like Ave curve also has a stable coin in the works and like many other projects will look to launch on more chains soon then we've got Lido a liquid staking protocol so instead of locking up your assets to participate in staking users can stake their assets on Lido and withdraw anytime you'll also get a derivative asset like stf for instance to represent your stake in ethereum which itself is a liquid asset that can be used as collateral or swap for other assets aside from ethereum Lido also supports liquid staking for polygon Solana polka dot and kusama so aside from the freedom to withdraw Stakes anytime your position is represented by a token which can also be deployed for other defy activities along with access to an easy and user-friendly staking process however Lido's 10 fee on staking rewards could be considered high for some and at the top we've got one of the most reputed D5 protocols maker Dow maker Dao allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency as well as deposit collateral in order to Mint the USD Peg stablecoin die unlike the largest stable coins like usdt and usdc dye is one of the more decentralized options in that no Central party controls its issuance and can be used in a lot of D5 projects and D apps however the drawback currently is that dye is collateralized to a large extent by centralized stable coins such as usdc maker Dow is one of the more active projects and in recent months have made plenty of moves for instance maker Dao recently voted to custody 1.6 billion dollars of its usdc collateral on coinbase Via its institutional grade service which would earn an interest rate of up to 1.5 percent so there you have it the top ethereum D5 protocols keep in mind that D5 Protocols are susceptible to different risks such as smart contract vulnerabilities or scam token listings is there a D5 project in our list you're particularly interested in let us know in the comments below and if you like this video also check out our

WOPl79rdaEU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOPl79rdaEU,all throughout 2022 we've been in a particularly painful crypto bear Market that has made most people turn to stable coins for protection but with three stable coins and the top 10 cryptos alone and over a hundred others on top of that which one should you choose well taking a look at coin gecko we can see that busd is the sixth highest ranking cryptocurrency and the third highest ranking stable coin with a market cap sitting at 22 billion this figure sat at just under 1 billion at the start of 2021 meaning busd has grown a whopping 2100 percent in just two years so what exactly is busd or binance USD [Music] busd launched in September 2019 when binance announced the launch of a new stable coin in partnership with paxos paxos is a regulated blockchain infrastructure platform and also offers crypto custodial services to Big names like PayPal like the other top stable coins uscc and usdt this stable coin is pegged one to one with USD is centrally issued and backed 100 by US dollars or cash equivalents contrary to what the name implies the USD is issued by paxos not binance binance was slapped onto the name for Branding purposes when you consider binance's already dominant position at the time combined with an aggressive marketing campaign for the new stable coin it didn't take long for millions of people to adopt busd which is now available on other well-known cryptocurrency exchanges such as OK X and huobi as well as being integrated with many D5 protocols with binance as its face busd users enjoy additional perks such as zero trading fees for certain trading pairs on its platform access to binance's launch pad or earning a higher interest compared to other stable coins via participating in their binance earn program aside from these busd these use case is the same as any other stable coin to protect users from volatility and enable users to seamlessly cash out of Trades without having to off ramp into Fiat but it's no secret that several algorithmic stable coins have disastrously depeged from the dollar in the past and even supposedly one-to-one backed centrally issued assets like usdt have also faced a fair share of fud and Regulatory scrutiny regarding the health and liquidity of its reserves so how does busd work and is it any different well like I said binance acts as the face of busd while paxos is the custodian of its reserves paxos and busd is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services which green listed the busd token in 2020 the financial regulator ensures the reliability of the stablecoin by overseeing busd's reserves custodianship and management paxos releases audited Reserve reports every month so that you can always analyze and keep track of the consistency between the supply of busd and its USD reserves to Mint busd an individual or institution can purchase busd through binance or on the paxos platform US dollars are deposited into the paxos reserve and busd is minted in return on the flip side busd is redeemable one to one with US dollars so if customers wish to exchange their busd for US dollars from paxos an equal amount of busd tokens will be destroyed and removed from circulation then in terms of where you can use busd so busd is natively issued by Pax those only on the ethereum blockchain so you can use it with dapps within ethereum's ecosystem however binance independently wraps ethereum native busd and issues a separate token called binance Peg busd on several other blockchains such as BNB chain polygon Avalanche and more note that binance Peg busd is a binance product and is not issued by paxos nor regulated by the nydfs as the name suggests binance Peg busd is pegged to the value of busd and is locked up on ethereum and minted on other chains on a one-to-one basis so ultimately you can choose to either use the original busd on ethereum or enjoy the benefits of the stable coin outside of ethereum through the binance peg busd so there you have it now I'd love to know your thoughts on bu USD what do you think is it on track to become the market leader well let me know in the comments below and if you'd like to learn more about the two highest ranking stable coins by market cap I've got the perfect video for you click right here to watch our next video where we compare usdc to usdt [Music],Youtube video,Binance USD Stablecoin (BUSD): Is It SAFER Than USDT and USDC?,2023-01-09 00:00:00,354.0,CoinGecko
uMhTT9Hs954,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMhTT9Hs954,air drop fever is upon us from optimism to optos there's nothing quite like the feeling of Landing free crypto in your wallets now if you don't already know airdrops involve crypto projects sending free tokens to their communities in a bit to encourage adoption and since most projects almost inevitably launch tokens at some point we have compiled a list of some potential air drops from projects that have yet to release a token despite having been live for some time so make sure to keep an eye out and of course also make sure to dyor before delving into any of them alright let's begin [Music] at number 10 on our list is a potential airdrop from a D5 protocol known as state Nets the platform allows users to deposit crypto into vaults which deploy the capital into various automated options strategies to earn yield the project was launched in 2021 and doesn't have a token yet so potentially users who've interacted with the protocol may get an airdrop in the future then at number nine we have Atlantis a new kind of decentralized lending application that enables uncollateralized crypto loans for institutional borrowers while offering lenders attractive returns due to the risks involved The Lending application was launched in mid-2022. to try your look at an airdrop you could deposit assets like uscc into the staking pools on Atlantis to earn rewards next up we have shardium a layer 1 blockchain attempting to achieve these centralization security and scalability through Dynamic State sharding Technology now according to sardium's roadmap the mainnet launch and token generation will happen in the first quarter of 2023 with five percent of the tokens reserved for the community for distribution via airdrops while there has not been any official announcement on how users can be eligible for this year's airdrop interacting with the test net might be the best way to go another potential airdrop to watch out for is from Zeta chain it is a layer 1 Omni chain smart contract platform that aims to connect many other blockchains securely without the use of bridges so the platform allows you to contribute to its test net to earn Zeta points you can earn Zeta points by swapping inviting new members and Reporting issues doing so may increase your probability of being eligible for their airdrop next up we have Kawaii a blockchain that combines the security of proof of work with the scalability of sharding by allowing miners to validate multiple chains using the same mining hardware and bandwidth Kauai has a social media Rewards program where users can earn quiet tokens by engaging with kawaii's social networks such as Twitter YouTube Reddit Tick Tock and Instagram users rewards are tracked by qui's custom-made Bots and progress can be tracked using the quad dashboard however it says the Qui network is still in its test net phase distribution of user rewards will happen after the client Network main net launch layer 0 is another project to keep an eye on for a potential airdrop founded in 2021 it is an omni chain interoperability protocol that unites decentralized applications across different blockchains after raising over 135 million in funding from some of the industry's top VCS there has been the speculation of a big airdrop to start users can try to get the airdrop by using Stargate the first protocol which launched on layer 0. some potential actions are providing liquidity staking sdg tokens and actively voting on Dow proposals users could also try out other projects which have launched on layer 0 such as D5 protocols rage trade or radiant Capital some have suggested using the Aptos Bridge which is powered by layer 0. next up we have arbitrum an ethereum layer 2 solution that is almost certain to have an airdrop as teased by the co-founder of off-chain labs the team building arbitrum airdrop Hunters are surely banking on it as we have seen a flurry of activity on the layer 2. some suggest bridging assets to and from arbit room interacting with arbitrim focused daps like GMX and dopeex and buying an nft from The arbitrim Odyssey nft collection post the Aptos airdrop many are hyped for other similar laya1 protocols like sweet just like Aptos sui was founded by former meta employees who are trying to develop a highly scalable layer 1 blockchain based on the Move programming language Suite has not revealed an exact launch date for its token but took to Twitter to remind the community that the suite token has not gone live yet and there are no plans for an airdrop up that said sweet may be worth keeping an eye on for a potential air drop this year next up we have zigzag a decentralized exchange built on ethereum layer 2 solution ZK sync unlike many dixes it uses an order book model instead of an amm model like uniswap the DAP launched a while back in October 2021 and unlike the other projects mentioned has already launched its token in June 2022 but has promised an airdrop to early users so making trades on the platform may make you eligible for the airdrop in the future last but not least is a potential airdrop from ZK sync itself the project just recently had a major upgrade that enables developers to host smart contracts deploy D5 protocols nfts and other types of applications on the ethereum network and it's not just the upgrade that has had closed crypto observers excited according to the Project's developer documentation the company is always intended to release a token for its ZK sync network but details on when it would happen have not been released in a Twitter spaces call on October 20th Steve Newcomb matter Labs Chief product officer said that the company has plans for a tokonomics announcement to be released in November now of course this brought up some speculations that early users of zkasync test Nets could receive an airdrop as a reward for their participation whether a ZK sync will follow optimism's example and airdropping tokens to its Community remains to be seen But the hopes remain high again before taking any action from airdrop Twitter threads or websites do your extensive research first scam artists may use airdrops to steal from unsuspecting users and also remember that most of the methods to be eligible for an airdrop are speculative so be sure to manage your expectations now have you ever heard of a lock drop well watch this video to find out how it works and how it differs from an airdrop [Music] thank you,Youtube video,Top 10 FREE Crypto Airdrops You

tLe6oYCUpKA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLe6oYCUpKA,both metamask and Trust wallet are free digital wallets that allow you to store send receive buy and exchange cryptocurrencies and even nfts but which one is better for your needs before we dive deep picking the right wallet is very important because different wallets provide different levels of security credibility supported tokens and user experience is it metamask or trust wallet let's find out let's start with metamask metamask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to store send receive buy exchange stake or Swap cryptocurrencies and crypto assets by default metamask supports the ethereum blockchain and its growing ecosystem of d-apps these include D5 platforms and nft marketplaces as well as specific d-apps like uniswap and compound however metamask has grown to support a larger Network including all evm networks like binance smart chain Avalanche and Aurora as well as evm compatible ethereum l2s and side chains like polygon optimism arbitrum and more now that we know all about metamask what are the advantage images of using it as your wallet the most notable Pro for using metamask is its popularity and you'll find it integrated with every ethereum and evm based D app out there there are also plenty of resources on metamask online and you'll probably be able to find your way around the app without much difficulty and then there's the ease of access to metamask whether using a mobile phone or computer metamask provides an iOS or Android app plus a browser extension for Chrome Edge Firefox or Brave browsers it's also compatible with Hardware wallets so you're free to take your wallet security to the next level on the downside though being a software crypto wallet metamask remains vulnerable to hacking via phishing malware and other means 2. metamask offers ethereum support by default so if you'd like to add a custom blockchain you'll have to manually add it to metamask which can be a bit confusing for beginners and three even with the manual feature metamask doesn't support Bitcoin or any other non-evm chains like Solana or Cosmos also metamask's most widely used product is its desktop browser extension so some might find the mobile app a bit clunky to use so who should be using metamask metamask is the best wallet for people who primarily use ethereum and evm chains or just anyone who's just starting out and wants a simple tried and tested app to use plus it's compatible with most browsers mobile phones and Hardware wallets metamask will also be suitable for those who want to use their web-based wallet with a hardware wallet however if you have a wide variety of crypto assets across different blockchains that may include Bitcoin then you might want to consider using trust wallets trustwallet is an alternative software cryptocurrency wallet and is the official self-custodial hot wallet of binance after being acquired by them in 2018 like metamask you can use trustwallet to transact and store ethereum-based tokens as well as cryptocurrencies like xrp and Bitcoin like metamask you can also interact with d-apps directly through an open source browser via their Mobile Wallet app they also recently released their browser extension which looks and feels very similar to metamasks trustwallet is an extremely versatile app on their mobile app you've got a wide variety of cryptocurrency support from ethereum to cardano to bitcoin to Ripple and many more it also has extensive features from providing users with access to a DF browser to the option of earning interest on your crypto where users can stake coins such as atom Dot and soul directly from the mobile app trustwallet is also integrated with features from centralized exchanges such as coinbase pay or binance pay where users can directly initiate a transfer from their exchange account into their trust wallets without manually switching apps pasting wallet addresses or scanning QR codes the recently released browser extension also has a very similar UI to metamask and aside from ethereum already has popular chains like the b d chain Avalanche and polygon added out of the box unlike metamask the trustwallet browser extension also supports Solana on the downside though the trust wallet browser extension is a newcomer and has not been as battle tested as metamask it also doesn't support Integrations with Hardware wallets for now like all other software wallets trustwallet is still more susceptible to hacking attempts than cold wallets if your portfolio includes a wide variety of crypto assets across different blockchains or you also dabble in the Solana ecosystem you're more likely suited to using trust wallet as an all-in-one place app as opposed to metamask which is mainly for ethereum and evm ecosystems it's also more beginner friendly compared to metamask as popular networks and tokens are already added by default as we wrap up the battle between metamask and Trust wallet is a long way from being over security wise both wallets provide high levels of encryption for your private keys and while metamask has the first mover advantage and is preferred by a seasoned crypto users try trust wallet is much more versatile and may have an edge in terms of Simplicity and ease of use so trust wallet versus metamask which one is better the choice is entirely up to you that all comes down to your needs and preferences and it's best that you give both a try to see which one you like more if you're leaning toward metamask and are curious about how to get started we've got the perfect video for you click here to watch our next video where we show you how to set up and use metamask [Music] foreign,Youtube video,Metamask VS Trust Wallet: Which is the

0cqDwtxUsNs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cqDwtxUsNs,in light of recent events in the crypto industry an important question has been raised can users really trust custodial institutions like crypto exchanges with the safety of their assets the majority of cryptocurrency investors had always entrusted them with their assets without pushing overly hard for transparency or performing verification to ensure that reserves were actually being maintained after the FDX collapse however this implicit trust has been shattered in response the call for proof of reserves has resurfaced in this video you're going to find out what it is how it works and what it will mean for crypto exchanges and most importantly for you so stick till the end of the video to find out the simplest way to track an exchange as proof of Reserves ideally any exchange user should be able to withdraw their funds at any time right proof of reserves is a cryptographic method that demonstrates and exchanges or institutions ability to honor withdrawals from its platform at all times by providing a way of keeping tabs on customer funds so broadly it consists of two parts assets which are represented by a pool of tokens held within a set of exchange addresses and liabilities which would be a current record of customers deposits these two should be equal at all times since custodial financial institutions like centralized exchanges are not supposed to be utilizing customers funds for other purposes to verify that an exchange is solvent via a proof of Reserve audit a Merkle tree is used to aggregate the total of all customer balances without exposing any private information okay so Merkel trees are pretty technical stuff but in simple terms they have a Merkel root which is the single point of connection for the data branches and ensures that the right information is stored in each of them therefore the information contained in each wallet address containing user assets can be aggregated to form one Merkle root which represents the sum of all user deposits they also provide a way for users to verify that specific assets tied to their own accounts are actually included in the audit on top of that Merkle trees ensure that data stored in the branches and leaves cannot be manipulated without being easily detected however there are limits even to this system since the Merkle tree only matches the snapshot at that specific point in time it will require a newly updated Merkle tree as The Reserve balance changes on top of that it is also difficult to account for any off-chain liabilities that said many current attestations of reserves by exchanges only include assets but not liabilities or have not been conducted with auditor oversight for many of these exchanges proper accounting is set to be in the works so watch out for those in the coming weeks only a few exchanges such as krakengate.io and okx have included liabilities for all or some assets in their pors so far

5ShfTOCIvgo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ShfTOCIvgo,once upon a time there emerged a digital currency called Bitcoin the cryptocurrency will go on to become all the rage in a few years but Bitcoin is not where it all started we have to go way back to the 80s to tell the full cryptocurrency story so sit back as we flip through the history pages of one of the most popular Technologies in the past decade the year is 1983. David Chown a cryptographer proposes a form of electronic cash during this time no cryptocurrencies existed in fact the term was not even coined until the late 80s David's concept was for a currency that could be sent untraceable and in a manner that did not require centralized entities almost 10 years 1995 after his proposal David founded digicash to put its concept into practice creating the first cryptographic electronic money called ecash in 1998 however David's company eventually filed for bankruptcy nevertheless the concepts put forward by digicash played an important role in developing later digital currencies there were other cryptocurrencies developed in the 90s such as e-gold hash cash B money which was mentioned in bitcoin's white paper almost a decade later and bit gold a concept developed by Nick Sabo in 1998. Nick sabo's concept used blockchain techniques such as a peer-to-peer Network mining a ledger and cryptography sounds familiar while Nick's big gold project was never implemented he is often credited with creating the concepts that eventually led to the creation of Bitcoin people even speculate about Nick sabo's being the anonymous Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto although Savo has denied this claim speaking of Satoshi Nakamoto let's fast forward to 2008 when the mysterious founder entered the scene on August 18 2008 the domain name bitcoin.org was registered and in October someone going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto sent an academic paper to a cryptography mailing list for closing a form of digital cash called Bitcoin Satoshi whose identity remains unknown proposed a cash system that's fully peer-to-peer no third party needed come January 3rd 2009 Satoshi mined the first block of the Bitcoin Network now referred to as the Genesis block the block includes a quote referencing a the Times article from January 3rd 2009 the day the block was mined the timestamp serves to prove when the block was mined and makes a permanent reference to the economic conditions during that period when distress of Banks and Central governments was at a peak January 3rd is also regarded as bitcoin's birthday though it wasn't until nearly a week later that Nakamoto released the software to the public a year later in 2010 Bitcoin became available to buy sell in and trade on online exchanges for the first time the first reported real-world financial transaction involving Bitcoin also took place that year when a florida-based man negotiated to pay 10 000 Bitcoin for pizza that's right two Papa John's Pizzas to be exact to this day the Bitcoin Community celebrates Pizza Day on May 22nd it wasn't until April 2011 that the price of Bitcoin crossed the one dollar Mark afterward within just three months the digital asset skyrocketed 2 000 in value and was trading at around 29 now volatility was just as rampant then as it is now because five months later Bitcoins bottomed out at about two dollars in November in other news Litecoin one of many Bitcoin Forks made its appearance that year and soon became the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap As Time progressed bitcoin's price continued to rise and so did its popularity and also its volatility by November 2013 Bitcoin hit a thousand dollars however prices started steadily falling shortly after but this would later seem to be the least of bitcoin's problems early 2014 the mount gox hack happened see milegox was more than just a big player in the cryptocurrency world at its peak in 2013 The Exchange handled a whopping 70 of all of Bitcoin transactions worldwide and in the next year it took a devastating hit in one of the largest Bitcoin hacks to date the company reported having lost hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins and shortly filed for bankruptcy around this period the number of all coins was growing but none came as close to stealing bitcoin's Thunder as ethereum when it came into the scene in 2015 a group of programmers including vitalik buterin launched ethereum a project that introduced the idea of smart contracts and decentralized applications ethereum's arrival was marked by the emergence of initial coin offerings platforms that help raise money for an upcoming project by giving investors Early Access while icos help projects launch and quickly gain momentum some ended up being scams that said ethereum smart contract model was widely copied by other new blockchains like cardano tezos and Neo to name a few which launched during this period in the second half of 2016 the ethereum network hard forked into two blockchains ethereum and ethereum classic to erase a hack from ethereum's blockchain and returns to stolen money to its original owners watch this video to find out more about the eth and Etc split meanwhile bitcoin's price soared in 2017 and even surpassed the ten thousand dollar Mark A year later Bitcoin would lose more than half its value but would go on to make its comeback in 2020. despite the economic shutdown due to the pandemic another sector that popped off that year was D5 boasting a TV out of over 11 billion before the end of the year a phenomenon which is now known as defy summer come 2021 Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies hit their all-time highs last year the digital asset went on an impressive Bull Run since the start of the year before hitting an all-time high of 69 000 towards the end of the year 2021 was also the first year nfts broke through into the mainstream despite being around since 2014. however the sun set in crypto Paradise as the prices started floating in 2022 before the headline grabbing Luna and may market crash during this period for the first time in over two years bitcoin's price fell below the twenty thousand dollar mark But despite the bear Market 2022 has been an eventful and exciting year for some crypto fans one of the most anticipated events in the crypto verse the ethereum merge took place in mid-september which saw ethereum positioning from proof of work to proof of stake cardano ethereum's rival also had a much anticipated upgrade known as The Vessel hard Fork which seeks to enhance the platform's transaction throughput speeds dap development capacity and security it's impressive to see the work started by figures such as David Cham as early as the 80s snowball into this huge and constantly evolving industry we now know now like we always say we're all early

BkrtjW2n5D0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkrtjW2n5D0,to see that the 2022 crypto scene has been full of headline grabbing sagas is an understatement in just a span of seven months major projects in the space have fallen hard from Grace first it was Tara then shortly after that Celsius then three arrows Capital then Voyager and now the latest inductee into the crypto Hall of Shame FTX yes one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world filed for bankruptcy on November 11th so here's how it all went down the day is Wednesday the 2nd of November coindesk a crypto News website releases an article on alameda's balance sheet so let's pause right there briefly focus on Alameda so Alameda research is a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm founded by fdx's Sam bankman freed in 2017. and is supposedly a separate entity from FTX though there have always been suspicions of their close Financial ties which was confirmed when alameda's balance sheet was published on coindesk so it showed that out of the 14.6 billion in assets held by Alameda research over a third of it was made up of fdx's native token FDT there are also significant amounts of Saul and other Solana ecosystem tokens such as Maps oxy feeda and SRM from serum adex co-founded by SBI depth a few days later Caroline Ellison CEO of Alameda research tweets out that the balance sheet information that was released by coindesk only tells a portion of the reality now this was the Calm before the storm on the same day the founder of binance Chang Pang Zhao AKA CZ announced that it would sell its ftt tokens due to recent Revelations that have come to light in response Alameda research CEO Caroline Ellison offered to buy binance's ftt Holdings for 22 dollars per token cz's response I think we will stay in the free market now at this time the price of ftt had already started falling but remained relatively steady at about 22 levels however not long after on-chain sleuths surfaced reporting that FTX was running low on reserve herbs which triggered the run on FTX all that was fueled to the already fiercely burning Bud fire and as a result fdt's prices started Free Falling as fearful users rushed to withdrawal funds from FDX and dumped their FDT Holdings now it's worth noting that all while this happened SBF tweeted to reassure users that assets were fine and then withdrawals were being processed now unsurprisingly these Suites have since been deleted as the exchange halted non-fiat withdrawals not even 24 hours after SVS claims that assets were fine on the 9th of November both SBF and CZ announced on Twitter about their agreement for binance to buy FTX in an attempt to solve the liquidity issue and protect users however CZ added that binance has the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time this statement didn't take long to materialize as just a little less than a day later binance pulls out of the deal saying that it had arrived at that decision as a result of corporate due diligence just a day before for resigning as CEO SBF released a statement apologizing to FTX users and claiming that they're doing everything possible to raise liquidity he further claimed that FDX International had 4 billion in easily tradable assets when it faced a 5 billion surge of withdrawals a couple of days before however some worrying reports came shortly after according to Financial Times FDX held just 900 million in easily sellable assets against nine billion of liabilities the day before it collapsed meaning that there was roughly an 8 billion dollar hole in fdx's balance sheet anyway to cap off the shocking downfall of one of the biggest exchanges in the world on November 11th the company filed for bankruptcy and Sam bankman freed announced his resignation now just when you think the drama is slow later that day FTX was hacked and more than 400 million was siphoned from its wallets and on top of that FTX also announced via its official telegram channel that FTX apps and its website had become vectors for malware now the new CEO Ryan Miller disclosed that they had been moving all their digital assets to Cold Storage which was expedited to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions unsurprisingly the masses suspected an Insider to blame for the exploit now in the latest development an address connected to the exploiter has been observed to be swapping the stolen funds into eth and has become the 36th largest holder of ether so did ftx's collapse have any effect on the crypto industry well just like the Celsius Tara and many any other crypto fiascos fdx's collapse had a ripple effect on the industry and dealt a blow to an already struggling crypto Market so following the news about FTX the overall cryptocurrency market cap plunged around 20 in a week from 1.01 trillion to roughly 830 billion now the world's biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell to a new low below sixteen thousand dollars since November 2020. some major projects were also affected due to exposure to the exchange for instance platforms like block fi had to pause withdrawals and even ask clients not to submit any deposits to block file wallets or interest accounts investment firms like Sequoia capital and Galloway Capital were also exposed to the FTX collapse with the latter reporting having roughly half of its capital stuck on FTX the Solana Foundation also disclosed in a blog post that it held 134.54 million SRM tokens and three point 43 million ftt tokens on FTX the blockchain seems to have taken a bigger Blow from The Saga compared to other blockchains with even FTX issued wrapped assets like so Bitcoin and so eth de-pegging as they became completely unbacked so there you have it a summary of what unfolded in the last couple of weeks now without a doubt more contagion would have ensued before this video even hits the tube and we may have to do an entirely separate video to cover the other victims of this Fallout but somewhere in all of that drama though is a lesson and there is no better time than now to emphasize how important it is to keep your funds safe starting with the golden rule not your keys not your coins regardless this has taken even many crypto veterans by surprise to say the least and even some of us at coing Gecko took some hits so our heart goes out to anyone affected by this tragic turn of events now they say that you should treat centralized exchanges how you treat public bathrooms you get in you do your business and you get out so another positive outcome of this show however is that exchanges have scrambled to assemble proof of reserves of other assets which in hindsight should have always been the norm though rather than keeping your coins on exchanges consider keeping them in a self-custodial wallet whether it is a Hut or a cold wallet either way you are the one who maintains control over your coins so make sure to click right here to learn more about the best crypto

1vEV-N8Rn7o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vEV-N8Rn7o,crypto has been a force to be reckoned with in recent years but not every country in the world is open to its adoption on the contrary there are crypto-friendly countries that have gone a step further with generous tax laws and Regulatory environments to encourage adoption and ensure access among the general public let's check some of them out first up is Portugal the southeast European country has set a good example for other European countries in terms of crypto friendliness for starters it currently views cryptocurrencies as a form of payment rather than an asset therefore cryptocurrency transactions are exempt from value-added tax however income related to professional cryptocurrency activities is taxed this includes companies that provide services related to cryptocurrency or traders who trade crypto as their primary source of income while Portugal is considered to be a tax Haven for crypto investors this year the Portuguese government proposed a new tax policy that will impose a 28 percent capital gains tax the standard capital gain rate in the country on cryptocurrency gains made within one year on top of that it also intends to impose a 10 tax on any free crypto transfers if approved will this be the end of the so-called Bitcoin Beach moving on another well-known crypto-friendly country is Singapore similar to Portugal If you buy crypto and sell it with profit you don't have to pay tax as capital gains are not taxed however if you trade on a regular basis you'll be taxed Singapore is monetary Watchdog the monetary authority of Singapore has stringent regulations to safeguard cryptocurrency investors but at the same time create a balanced system in which crypto can operate as a result the country is home to several crypto projects including the likes of zilica quantum kyber network bluesell and many others at number three we have another European country Germany unlike some countries on this list Germany doesn't recognize crypto as an asset but rather as private money the central European country exempts Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from capital gains taxes as long as they're held for at least one year the same goes for staking and lending rewards if you realize capital gains on your staking income it will not be taxed as long as you held the assets for more than a year in the case that the assets are exchanged before a year elapses they'll remain tax exempt if the profit is less than 600 euros Germany is also prominent for being home to several blockchain companies like Iota and EOS next up we have Switzerland one of the initial shining stars in the world of cryptocurrencies in 2018 Swiss banks were the first to allow crypto companies to open business accounts like many other crypto-friendly countries private investors in Switzerland do not pay capital gains tax on their crypto profits the Federal Tax Administration in Switzerland determines whether you are a private investor or Not by looking at your trading volume the time period you own the assets before disposing of them and the size of your investment profits to name a few additionally buying and selling cryptocurrency is completely exempt from taxes in Switzerland as long as you are considered to be a private investor by the federal tax administration the European country is famous for the small City crypto Valley which houses popular crypto projects including ethereum and cardano to name a few alright at number five we have a small island nation Malta the country recognizes crypto as a medium of exchange and more importantly also as a store of value this means that you'll not be subjected to any capital gains tax on all long-term profits you generate from selling your crypto however professional Traders are subjected to a business income tax that is as low as zero percent to as high as 35 percent on their profits depending on the bracket they fall in on the Maltese tax system the Mediterranean based country is home to crypto exchanges such as okx and bitbay moving on at number six we have Bermuda a Caribbean Island state with a very lenient approach to financial regulations the nation is considered a tax Haven as individuals in the country don't pay personal income tax similarly Bermuda does not impose attacks on the buying selling or holding of cryptocurrency the same goes for using crypto as a form of payment as it is legalized it is not subject to any tax in 2019 Bermuda became the first government to accept stablecoin usdc for tax payments at number seven we have a popular tax Haven outside digital assets the Cayman Islands for several years the Cayman Islands have been the go-to tax Haven for investors in diverse business markets and crypto is no exception the Region's tax Authority the Cayman Islands monetary Authority imposes neither a capital gains tax nor an income tax on its residents crypto companies are also left off the hook as there's no corporate tax for businesses next up is Slovenia another country that has been very welcoming towards crypto the country has proposed new tax laws for digital assets but in the meantime the European country does not view capital gains on cryptocurrency as income which means that individuals are not taxed when selling crypto the new law however proposes a 10 taxation rate and a general tax exemption on up to ten thousand Euros of redeemed cryptocurrency per year and a five percent flat tax rate on transactions the Alpine Country is home to the most crypto-friendly European city of 2022. Ljubljana its capital which has hundreds of vendors accepting crypto payments at number nine on our list is Puerto Rico a popular destination for North Americans since the overseas territory is treated as a separate country when it comes to taxation in the U.S investors pay as much as 37 percent on capital gains which applies to crypto and other assets one of the tax breaks under act 60 known as the individual investors act drops that tax obligation down to zero if certain qualifications are met this makes Puerto Rico an attractive destination for entrepreneurs and crypto Traders last but not least we have El Salvador the country that made headlines in September 2021 when it became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the US dollar which was their National currency the government did this to Market itself as one of the few countries without crypto tax and attract more Investments to the region to top it off they announced that all foreigners would be Exempted from paying taxes on any income from their Bitcoin gains the Central American country is hailed as one of the best crypto tax-free jurisdictions in the world these were some of the countries that have warmed up to crypto and are even using the industry to fuel their economies while there are still many countries that are still skeptical about the technology or have even outright banned crypto others will nevertheless be focused on creating an environment for the industry to flourish which crypto-friendly country did we leave out let us know in the comments [Music] [Laughter],Youtube video,"TOP 10 Crypto-Friendly Countries In The World | Singapore, El Salvador & more!",2022-11-23 00:00:00,508.0,CoinGecko
tH80FpsC5Pg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH80FpsC5Pg,YouTube demonetization Twitter censorship Facebook bands the thing is you can never truly freely express your thoughts or stay private on social media not when there's a big brother centralized party watching over you so in comes decentralized social media what exactly is it where is it now how does it work we'll find out all of these and more in this video let's go over how the community run ethereum website defines these decentralized social networks as it is necessary to understand all of the functions that need to be available Within These Networks decentralized social networks are blockchain based platforms that enable social interaction content creation and distribution you can think of them as having all of the characteristics you know from Facebook and Instagram still instead of relying on a server and the company's buildings they rely on a distributed network of computers the blockchain they are decentralized social media networks that protect user privacy and enhance data security and they feature tokens and non-fungible tokens nfts that create new ways through which users can monetize their content think of it this way on Facebook you have to enter your name surname age location and so on the platform will also ask you to confirm your email set images and get as much info out of you as possible in these decentralized counterparts all you have to do is typically connect a D5 wallet a non-custodial one where you own the private key ease and begin using them helping you maintain your data privacy how to decentralized social platforms work we must go over the social graph to truly understand how they work this model is utilized across numerous centralized and decentralized social media platforms the social graph is a social network model that Maps everyone on a platform and establishes how they are related this allows them to communicate with each other by utilizing the front end of the platforms which refers to the things users can see and interact with in the case of traditional social media platforms they are self-contained and hosted on the server of the corporations that made them meta for example hosts Instagram and Facebook on the other end of this spectrum decentralized social media platforms exists by leveraging the power of a decentralized ledger which is the public blockchain they are built on this allows anyone anywhere and at any point to operate a node and access the back end of the network or create a decentralized application d-app and curate their feed this also means it has all the advantages of being on the blockchain including increased security increased user control more monetization opportunities less downtime and no censorship or control from any middlemen or companies what are the key features of decentralized social media networks these networks get built on top of public blockchains leveraging their decentralized and missionless nature to build and facilitate the connection and content sharing functionality between people unlike networks owned by corporations like Facebook Twitter or Tick Tock nobody can control what content is allowed or ban and restrict any user Facebook Instagram and so on all have administrators and Bots that can remove your posts censor you and just delete anything you post that does not follow their guidelines decentralized social media platforms on the other hand rely on Smart contracts instead and rarely if ever censor you in any way anyone can connect their crypto wallet or create an account without needing to provide personal information which maintains the high level of security privacy and anonymity promised by blockchain technology by adding non-fungible token nft functionality these decentralized social media networks can feature avatars or images that still remain owned by the users which means that users if they decide to can disconnect them from the social media Network at any time and maintain full ownership over them so why do you need decentralized social media platforms today there exists a plethora of different decentralized social media platforms let's go over and take a look at some of the most popular decentralized social media platforms that you need to be aware of in order to fully grasp what they aim to do first we need to look at Minds mines is a social media platform that aims to bring freedom of speech to people whilst also allowing them to earn crypto in the process a decentralized Facebook so to speak then there's social X this is an open source and Community Driven distributed project that essentially aims to replicate the functionality of platforms such as Instagram as closely as possible without the hindrances of being centralized or controlled by a third party next we can look at bitcloud a decentralized social network with its own custom-built blockchain which can scale social applications to 1 billion users a close alternative to Twitter so what about YouTube YouTube has been infested with advertisements content creators keep getting demonetized for absurd reasons and the company behind the platform just has too many rules dtube is the decentralized alternative where content is monetized differently and content creators won't have to worry about censorship there's also less ads too so that's another win next there's float think of it like a decentralized art station or deviantART where people can share their art performances and stories scent is another exceptional platform built on top of ethereum eth that features long-form content questions and answers and solid visuals like an alternative quora then there's blockster which is one of the most popular crypto social media platforms that features coins social nfts games staking Community governance peer-to-peer P2P transactions and much more blockster aims to be a one-size-fits-all solution of all of the aforementioned social media platforms all of these platforms aim to fill a hole in the market and provide a decentralized solution to the centralized and company-controlled social media networks we have today the goal is to enable user Freedom avoid censorship or other geographical blockades and enable new ways through which creatives can monetize their content so how excited are you for the future of decentralized social media let us know

a5qDMwk8Jzk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5qDMwk8Jzk,there are two horses currently ahead of the herd in the stablecoin race the first horse is far ahead on the racetracks while the second horse is trying to close in on the Gap let's meet the heroes usdt and usdc the two largest players in the space based on market capitalization but which stablecoin is going to win the race in this video we'll dive into some differences between the two Fiat backed stable coins but first what are Fiat backed stable coins so stable coins generally come either as centralized or decentralized Fiat back saber coins fall in the centralized category and these two stable coins are the best example of Fiat backed stable coins as the name suggests they are backed by a reserve of Fiat currencies in regulated institutions like Banks ideally this type of stable coin is backed by actual fiat currency such that minted stable coins can be redeemed for real Fiat at a one to one ratio the minting and burning processes are tightly controlled to ensure that the stablecoin doesn't stray away from Fiat pegging now let's shift our Focus to the largest stable coin in the industry in 2014 tether Holdings Limited introduced the concept of Fiat backed stable coins with tether USD this was the first time any company offered its users a platform to trade a US dollar backed crypto by tapping into the Best of Both Worlds tether opened up cases for crypto and payments and remittances to name a few it wasn't long till crypto trading pairs started listing against usct therefore giving the stablecoin a first mover advantage in the market four years later Center a Consortium co-founded by Circle and coinbase created you U.S dollar coin usdc so usdc solved similar problems to his competitor and on top of that it wanted to ensure that there is the transparency of one to one backing that is for every uscc created one dollar of USD is held in reserve either in the form of U.S dollars or other cash Alternatives this is a big deal for stable coins as it is a form of assurance for the safety of investors funds now we'll go deeper into this later but in the meantime let's compare the two acids head-to-head starting with volume and market capitalization the trade volume for usdt is a testament to its popularity as of making this video the 24-hour trade volume of the stablecoin clocks in at 28 billion a higher amount than Bitcoin and even further ahead of its direct competitor uscc which has over two point 7 billion in trading volume in terms of market cap usdts has risen to over 68 billion compared to usdc's 45 billion making it the third biggest cryptocurrency behind only Bitcoin and ethereum while tether is still the clear leader in terms of market cap usdc has been growing considerably faster especially last year thanks to the push from D5 earlier this year the total supply of usdc on the ethereum blockchain even surpassed that of usdt for the first time okay then what about price stability uscc's dollar pegging has been solid and tangible slips haven't been recorded in the past year even in the face of the USD collapse similarly usdt's dollar Peg is also tightly maintained and hardly Strays away from the 99 cents to a dollar and one cent range however usdt suffered a momentary d-peg during the Terra Luna Fiasco slipping to as low as 95 cents on May 12 2022 on some crypto exchanges now let's move on to one of the most important aspects of Fiat backed stable coins reserves tether has had multiple controversies and has been in hot water with several different authorities due to concerns about its reserves after its launch tether's website read every tether is always backed one to one by traditional currency held in our reserves however in 2019 during a court case by the New York Office of the Attorney General a lorry representative admitted that the USC team's circulation wasn't backed by 100 USD but instead a combination of different liquid assets including cryptocurrencies generally termed as cash equivalence now after the controversy tether's website to exchange to every tether is always 100 backed by our reserves which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and from time to time may include other assets and receivables from loans made by tether to third parties which may include Affiliated entities in February last year after a 22-month inquiry the New York attorney general reached a settlement with ethanex the pairing company of tether accusing the companies of unlawfully hiding losses even X had to pay an 18.5 million fine and is no longer allowed to operate in New York plus it will have to provide quarterly reports on its reserves based on the latest reserves breakdown just under 80 percent of its reserves are in cash cash equivalents and other short-term deposits and Commercial papers with over 99 percent of these having a duration of 0 to 90 days uscc is perceived by many as a safer and much more transparent alternative to usct unlike tether uscc issuer Circle has been publishing third-party monthly attestations to confirm that it does possess sufficient Capital to back each individual token on a one-to-one basis since its launch four years ago the attestation reports are provided by Grant Thornton one of the top Global accounting firms it's important to know that although the attestation reports provided by Grant Thornton verify circles assertions regarding the value of the usdc reserves they are not audits over the past few years stable coins have been in the news for controversial reasons and several attempts have been made to regulate the digital asset for instance custodial financial institutions are establishing rules which stablecoin projects must follow to ensure proper accounting and liquidity for every minted stable coin regulatory attempts have also in intensified since the tragic collapse of terraful Nations UST stablecoin that said it may take some time before stable coins become fully regulated as there are many hurdles to overcome all in all while uscc and usdt are the most popular options in the market right now there's still a need for increased transparency to better protect investors now this goes for the whole stable coin space in general in the meantime remain Vigilant and dyor even when dealing with these less volatile assets in the industry so which of the two is your go-to stablecoin let us know in the comments now explore the other side of the stablecoin coin decentralized stable coins be sure to watch the next video to find

V7nEBwmsWYs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7nEBwmsWYs,question are we in the middle of a bear Market or a market correction well what is a market correction even mean well the crypto Market has been declining this year with the biggest digital asset Bitcoin falling below the twenty thousand dollar Mark for the first time in a while other cryptocurrencies have been struggling just as much or more so yes we are in the middle of a bear Market a different phenomenon though from a market correction in this video we're going to find out the difference between the two let's begin by checking out an example okay so let's assume asset X is in great demand and has a lot of investors buying into it however it gets to a point of exhaustion when a majority of buyers have already bought into the asset and there are no more new buyers to support the uptrend so prices start to fall this is what we call a correction now while there isn't a hard-coded rule figure wise in traditional finance a correction is generally categorized by a gradual decline where prices drop more than 10 percent but less than 20 percent over the course of several days or weeks before prices recover again this works the same with crypto though a typical correction with crypto can be much larger so in the case of asset X and many other assets in crypto a correction often happens when the economy of the asset is a expanding this may be a result of investors becoming over confident leading them to over by the asset and push the prices too high which sets the stage for a correction to bring the price level back down now other triggers of Market Corrections include things like fomo which is when investors try to catch Rising price trends only for a market correction to come later and shake off this unsustainable growth now there are also various other triggers such as Market sell-offs hacks regulations and more okay so then let's briefly dive into what a bear Market is is it any different from a correction well short answer yes unlike Market Corrections bear markets are categorized by prolonged periods of falling prices and distinctly widespread negative Market sentiment in traditional finance a fall of 20 or more is typically considered bear Market territory however again in crypto the figure is typically higher but like we've stated this figure is not set in stone and can vary depending on market conditions now another big difference between the two is that bear markets usually occur when there is an economic recession or a market crash compared to Corrections which happen when the economy is growing okay so then what about the time frame of each well time may not be a defining factor for Market Corrections and bear markets they still tend to have different time frames due to the differences is in Decline as you might have guessed Market Corrections generally have shorter durations as the decline is smaller on the other hand Bearer markets can last for many months or sometimes even years I mean remember the very first crypto winter that lasted from November 2013 to January 2015. over those 14 months Bitcoin declined over 80 percent and the next crypto winter in 2017 was even longer okay then frequency Wise Market Corrections tend to occur more frequently than bear markets in fact there may be several Market Corrections within a bull market before the market takes a more substantial downturn into a longer lasting bear market so naturally because of its more severe declines a bear Market typically takes longer than a market correction to recover to its previous high so as you can tell now bear markets and Market Corrections they're a normal part of the investing process and there's no need to panic when they happen understanding the difference between a market correction and a bear Market can help you better assess market trends so that you can make better investment decisions okay now that you have a better understanding of the two we have the perfect video for you click right here to find out the common mistakes that other investors or even you make during a crypto bear Market foreign [Music],Youtube video,Bear Market VS Correction: MAJOR Differences Explained,2022-11-09 00:00:00,330.0,CoinGecko
jsnblE6jXxQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsnblE6jXxQ,there is a new project in town dubbed by many as the Solana killer interestingly enough there was so much hype around the project even before it was launched ring any bells well the project is Aptos it gained much traction as it is backed by notable VCS and there were widespread discussions about its mouth-watering promises after four years of development and millions in funding Aptos finally launched on the 17th of October however its launch wasn't ideal Aptos was supposed to deliver an impressive 160 000 transactions per second but instead it was only four TPS now for context that's almost half as slow as the Bitcoin Network now optos responded to the criticism and claimed that the network was performing as expected with activity expected to increase as more ecosystem participants join in this video Let's dive deeper into the project including its technology so make sure you stick around to find out what the hype is all about okay first what is Aptos so Aptos is a layer one blockchain platform like ethereum and Solana like many blockchains it aims to create the ideal blockchain one that maintains decentralization and delivers top-notch security all while offering scalability through stability fast transaction speeds and low fees in their white paper optos claims to offer safe scalable and upgradable web 3 infrastructure these are bold claims but there are more reasons the layer 1 platform was so highly anticipated for instance the team behind the project aptos's development started as early as 2018 by a team headed by former meta formerly Facebook employees Mo Shake as optos as CEO and Avery Ching as CTO the connection with meta garnered much attention from both the crypto community and investors the team raised 350 million in funding from a series of notable investor campaigns led by Andreessen Horowitz and FDX Ventures Aptos however isn't the first cryptocurrency with a direct connection to the popular social media firm in 2019 meta tried its hand at a blockchain known as DM however pressure from government Regulators prompted the tech giant to shelf the project but developers saw value in its key differentiator parallel execution which brings us to the next segment how does optos work aptos's parallel execution ensures that all transactions are performed simultaneously and validated afterward it takes a different approach from a blockchain like ethereum which processes transactions sequentially the the downside though is that sequential execution of transactions affects transaction finality as you have to wait for each new transaction to be added and validated first sequential blockchains prioritize security but this comes at a heavy cost of efficiency Aptos the solution to this is to execute transactions first and ask questions later basically adequately Place transactions will go through and fail transactions won't halt the whole chain instead they are aborted and re-executed aptos's other unique feature is its custom programming language known as move which was first designed for the DM blockchain similar to ethereum solidity the core of the Aptos blockchain was designed using move inspired protocols move is supposed to make transactions faster without sacrificing security however developers must spend sufficient time learning the language before they can start building aptos-based projects what consensus mechanism does optos use like other POS blockchains validators on the Aptos Network verify the Integrity of data blocks added to the blockchain they ensure that malicious data blocks are screened out of the chain to keep the network secure running a validator node on Aptos is basically the same process whereby you have to stake at least a predetermined number of Aptos tokens so speaking of options tokens it functions as the utility and governance token of the platform now before launch there was no news of the tokenomics for apt and this lack of visibility led to concerns in the community which the team sought to quiet by revealing their tokenomics unfortunately crypto Twitter didn't take kindly to 49 of the token Supply being allocated to the investors core contributors and Foundations Aptos said tokens held by private investors and current core contributors are subject to a four-year lock-up schedule from the mainnet launch to avoid dumps however according to the team's blog post 82 percent of the tokens on the network are staked across all categories meaning that the company and early insiders will earn the majority of staking rewards which are not subject to lockups alright let's now find out how Aptos Stacks up against incumbents like ethereum and Solana okay so first atso's challenges Solana on what it Prides itself on most transaction speeds Aptos claims a throughput of 160 000 transactions per second compared to Solana's 65 five thousand still Solana is a proven fast blockchain it has however suffered multiple technical breakdowns over the last few months and Aptos aims to attempt to solve this problem then on the other hand we have ethereum a tried and tested Network that lacks scalability and quick transaction processing so Aptos is trying to solve ethereum speed and scalability issues and Solana's downtime problems to become the ideal blockchain that said it's too early to make any comparisons and only time will tell if Aptos could back up its claims now there is perhaps a more interesting competitor that's worth mentioning that is missing Labs Suite blockchain just like Aptos Suite is being developed by ex meta Founders using the move programming language and is another high profile layer 1 blockchain Project both projects have also raised in excess of 300 million each to pursue their goal of a scalable and secure low fee blockchain okay wrapping up it's true that we have blockchains that are already doing a great job however they are still far from perfect developers are working hard on fixing their systems while facing up and coming competitors like Aptos so Aptos is attempting to develop a new system that solves the space's prevailing problems in one go now that's a big mountain to climb but on paper their technology seems promising we'll have to see however if they actually deliver on their promises so what do you think can optos shake up

known as mercury on top of that blacksmith Labs nft holders will be able to generate Forge dollars and ecosystem token that can be used to buy whitelist spots from the projects onboarded on Mercury blacksmith Labs was minted earlier this year at 2.2 Sol and the floor price is now at 118 sold at number nine we have the Catalina whale mixer a project that aims to create an environment where holders can participate as a community and well make whale celebrity Superstars the team negotiated a deal with a Hollywood Production Studio to develop whale television and animated adult comedy

and its current floor price is 20 sold next up at number seven we have cats on crack a collection of 6969 coolest cats on the street each cat can be staked to earn crack dollars and ecosystem token cat holders were airdropped cats milk bottles which they can use to increase their staking yield to earn 1.25 times correct dollars when staked some users speculate milk bottle which currently has a floor price of six soul will be used for mutation similar to mutant ape serum in the near future crack can also be used on the black market to participate in Raffles and even auctions in the future the degenerate cats were also minted at two Soul The Collection currently has a floor price of 36.97 sole moving on we have ornery the top selling nft p2e game on Solana on the 31st of August 2021 10 000 unique aurorian nfts were minted and sold out in just three seconds at the price of one Soul a couple of months later the game dropped offering players a PVE and PVP experience filled with character quests along with turn-based combat rounds and a diverse gaming atmosphere while allowing them to earn Ori dollars these cute little nfts were minted at the price of one Soul the floor price of the collection currently sits at 24.9 soul next up at number five we have the degenerate ape Academy which produced the first million dollar nft sale on the Solana blockchain more on this in a bit the Gen ape is a collection of ten thousand flashy randomly generated ape avatars created by Degen labs holders have an opportunity to breed and mint new apes and be a part of the Degen Dao on top of that they can elect student council members who can make proposals for the community to vote on members of the Degen Dao can earn passive income by staking Soul via the Degen infrastructure core Services validator node and can earn six to seven percent apy with a 0.01 sole minimum staking amount in September 2021 a Degen ape sold for 5890 Seoul 1.1 million dollars at the time making it the first million dollar nft sale on the Solana blockchain the purchase was made by Moon Rock capital A blockchain consulting firm de Jan Apes minted over a year ago at the price of six Soul the current floor price of the collection is 67 sold at number four we have okay Bears the first ever solana-based nft project to break into the top daily trading charts of Open Sea outperforming even ethereum Blue Chip projects The Collection consists of 10 000 algorithmically generated Bears each with different background color outfit and expression with some of these traits being rarer than others like most of the nft projects we have just covered OK bears nfts come with utility-like access to exclusive merchandise and live events in August OK Bears announced its first airdrop to the community giving away 10 000 nfts that can be redeemed for physical gold or cash equivalent in the last quarter of the year minting of the ten thousand Bears took place earlier this year for 1.5 sole each and the collection currently has a floor price of 67.5 sold the second runner-up on our list is the so-called crypto punks of Solana the Solana Monkey Business it's one of the OG projects in the Solana ecosystem that launched its extremely limited gen 1 monkeys collection in June 2021 however SMB was not an instant hit then come August SMB had another go when they launched their next collection of 5 000 Gen 2 monkeys this time the monkeys sold like hotcakes after the Gen 2 launch monkey Dow was formed to provide a community for holders as one of the few Solana nft projects that have stood the test of time today smb's floor price rests at 200 Soul a little over a year later after minting at the price of two soul the runner-up on our list is Utes the latest nft project from the creators of the leading collection on Solana this made it one of the most hyped collections on Solana and therefore made it difficult to get your hands on a ute at the time of the mint to get one you needed to either be a holder of a d God or submit an application and get hand selected by the Ute team in terms of utility the project came up with the Ute store which is going to function as a place for artists to submit and list their own customized versions of traits that can then be purchased by other holders to use in their own nfts the 15 000 unfts were released with a mint price equivalent to 33 sold the floor price skyrocketed to 130 sold last but not least to close off our list is d-gods the standout and the Solana nft space d-gods is regarded as the bayc of Solana the projects are however different for starters the gods is a deflationary nft project thanks to burning when holders burn these nfts through a special process the nfts don't disappear instead they're converted into dead Gods a one-to-one fine art Undead version of the original digha note that dead Gods is not a separate collection but rather it contains the metadata of the original d-god d-gods can be staked to mine 2.5 dust dollars per day whereas dead Gods can mine three times as much dust dollars can be used on its Dusty's Marketplace to buy exclusive white list spots for upcoming projects merchandise courtside tickets and even Blue Chip nfts The Collection was minted on October 9th 2021 at the price of three sold the floor price of the collection has shot up to 369.69 sold in the last few months a

bwgHMbZedk4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwgHMbZedk4,foreign if you're already a seasoned MMORPG player with games like Guild Wars 2 World of Warcraft or Black Desert you'll feel right at home in Big Time an upcoming MMORPG set in the far future where you and your friends can explore exciting dungeons across space and time complete Quests for Albert Einstein battle against robot Pirates at giant insects all while earning some precious loot along the way although the game has not been fully released we've had the opportunity to play the game in Early Access so let's dive in as RPGs do the game starts out with character creation where players will have to pick between four classes Time Warrior chronomancer Shadow Blade and Quantum fixer but don't feel too pressured about getting things right here there will be chances for you to swap out something called pocket watches to switch classes later in the game once you've made your decision click on confirm and that's it and just like that your talk just right into the world of big time no fancy character creation screens and a thousand sliders for us to mask our real life insecurities everyone gets the same cookie cutter character at least for now at its core big time is a fairly simple game left click to attack right click for another attack chain these up properly and you'll get to perform a special combo attack items in class specific skills can also be assigned to hotkeys for quick easy access even though the camera angle makes aiming a little tricky at times for the most part combat plays out smoothly even in dungeons jam-packed with large mobs of enemies players in your screen lighting up with spells and special effects like a front row seat to 4th of July kill enough enemies and your character will level up earning skill points that you can use to learn new spells or buff up your character stats depending on your character class improving specific stats may be required to equip specific gear in a similar vein to most other RPGs game progression and big time is more or less the same kill enemies earn XP earn better gears level up rinse and repeat since each dungeon is procedurally generated you'll never have the same Adventure each time if you enter the same dungeon multiple times you'll quickly realize that they'll all have different Maps requirements and enemies on paper these dungeons offer some sense of replayability forcing players to think on the Fly since each dungeon is unique but the novelty wears off quickly while some of the side quests which you have to complete before facing a dungeon boss may require some skill and creativity most of them tend to be fairly trivial be it collecting a certain amount of items or activating switches guarded by mobs of enemies these tasks can get tedious however the objectives do get harder if there are more or higher leveled players in your party for arpgs the end of a dungeon run is usually filled with a bountiful loot Fest reigning epic and legendary items but that's not the case here the defeat of bosses is usually anticlimactic with no notable Treasures to Rejoice for in fact most of the loots are found randomly throughout the dungeon from normal mobs but even then these are usually more of the same items you've been using since level one just with better stats much like other crypto games nfts will be a big part of Big Time Universe which are divided into cosmetic nfts and space nfts cosmetic nfts can be found in game which will allow you to change the look of your weapons and character on the other hand their space nfts are used to expand your own personal space known as the time machine where you produce new items and upgrade your old ones space nfts are also needed for players to generate and earn Big Time tokens in the future both types of nfts can be purchased from the marketplace but at the moment features for the space nfts aren't available just yet big time's attempt to become the first AAA game in the web 3 space is a commendable one but it's clear that a lot of work still needs to be done with familiar combat and gameplay Big Time puts a roguelite spin on the traditional RPG formula there's no overarching story for players to complete you can just pick up the game with your friends and start exploring right off the bat e ACH dungeon offers new quests and challenges to overcome which keeps things fresh for returning players while forcing them to constantly adapt their strategies and builds however things can get stale after a while unlike most RPGs that reward Exploration with hidden secrets or rare Treasures Big Time fails to beckon the same sense of adventure there's little to look at and look for around the map with players usually just spreading

there's simply not enough proverbial carrot to put it in the grind for now which web 3 games would you like us to review next let us know in the comments and we might just cover it in the next

BsENQbXybGQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsENQbXybGQ,since 2020 the most popular buzzwords circling around town have been cryptocurrency nfts and now web 3 and despite web 3 still being a long way off from becoming a mainstream stay you might be surprised to learn that some top brands are already venturing into web 3. so which top brands are pioneering web 3 how are they doing it and why does it matter let's find out if you can imagine this there was a time long ago when the internet used to be like a magazine for people to consume information there wasn't much you could do on there except move from one page to another via hyperlinks then came the read write web 2 era it's the era we're currently in where you can not only consume content but also create and publish your own information on the internet with the web 3 era Tech enthusiasts anticipate a read write own era where individual users are responsible for controlling their personal data and virtual assets via blockchain technology you can learn more about web3 in our what is web 3 video but for now let's look at the top six brands in web 3. 6. FIFA everyone has their eyes set on the November 2022 World Cup but there is in fact something else to look forward to before then FIFA has decided to follow in the footsteps of the popular NBA Top Shot nft collection by launching its very own digital Collectibles platform called FIFA plus collect any football fan will be able to buy and sell some of the top iconic soccer moments as nfts these include everything from FIFA art to images to viral videos all hosted as digital collectibles on FIFA plus collect earlier in the year in May 2022 FIFA partnered with the blockchain platform algorand they're working together to create a FIFA web 3 digital Collectibles platform and launch a digital wallet specially dedicated to FIFA fandom so why does this matter in the past we've seen how sports memorabilia and stickers mean so much to fans all around the world it's a way to engage with your favorite player and become a part of the World Cup experience even from miles away and who knows in the future you may also enjoy other benefits like discounts on tickets or special access to real world assets like merch 5. Formula One formula one's vision is a little blurry at the moment however what's definite is they have registered a trademark filing for nfts digital Collectibles and cryptocurrencies at the moment we're not sure what exactly F1 is planning to do there's literally a wide ranging list of potential goods and services that could be on offer what's certain though is that F1 intends to launch its products during next year's race so here's something to look forward to in the Las Vegas Strip circuit Ron pree in 2023 our best guess is on F1 allowing cryptocurrency payments and listing some real world items like vehicles or clothing as nfts 4. Clinique a good face beat does not always have to be within the confines of your skin it could transcend much farther into the virtual world in October 2021 the makeup brand Clinique launched its first ever makeup nft by partnering with nft and software firm Daz 3D thereafter Clinique launched an nft giveaway that skyrocketed customer loyalty and engagement with its platform now Clinique is working on designing its second exclusive nft collection called metaverse more like us to challenge unrealistic beauty standards and celebrate diversity the collection will feature six distinct makeup looks with diverse skin tones hairstyles and face shapes and why does it matter you ask well at the moment only 20 percent of users and creators in the metaverse are women however Clinique says they will work with a diverse group of leading Global makeup artists and creators to work on the project with a record-breaking 888 female and non-binary avatars Clinique is bringing much needed inclusivity and representation in the digital Beauty web3 World three we can't really talk about top brands in web 3 without mentioning Gucci the company kicked things off by accepting crypto payments in May 2022 in the U.S then they launched the Gucci Garden virtual tour which is like a metaverse one-of-a-kind Gucci experience hosted on Roblox Gucci is also well familiar with the nft world one of their nft film collections sold for twenty five thousand dollars they've also recently partnered with super rare having bought twenty five thousand dollars of rare tokens to become a part of the super rare Dao now they've launched their first art exhibition on Gucci's Vault Art Space titled the next 100 year years of Gucci essentially a collection of Gucci's kaleidoscopic Heritage and what could come next 2. Air Mets luxury brand Hermes is also doing something along the lines of what Gucci has done so you know how when playing games on Roblox you can customize your character with the coolest clothing footwear and other items Hermes plans to do something similar by offering its products for use in the metaverse the plan is for consumers to download software that views stores and manages their virtual Goods digital Collectibles and nfts plus there might be fashion and trade shows simulated in an online virtual augmented or mixed reality environment users can then virtually attend these shows and buy or sell virtual goods from within an online Marketplace sounds cool but why does it matter well Hermes is only one example of a luxury brand Making Moves In the metaverse today fashion events are taking place digitally featuring some of the most popular wearables on Virtual runways even recently the decentraland four-day Fashion Week event featured Brands like Dolce and Gabbana Eli Saab and Tommy Hilfiger and last but not least Nike Nike is at the Forefront of web 3 through the Nike land metaverse running on Roblox here fans feel more connected to Nike by doing lots of fun things like socializing with one another virtual meetups with sports celebrities like LeBron James taking part in promotions and having exclusive access to Nike's digital products on offer the first Nike nft collection was sneakers that users were free to customize with special effects and different patterns the project was a huge success s and in just six minutes Nike sold a total of 600 pairs worth 3.1 million dollars in December of last year Nike took another huge step in nft verse by acquiring leading nft fashion brand RTF KT it's no secret how the fashion nft industry is becoming quite a thing in fact Dune analytics estimates that Nike earned over 185 million dollars in Revenue just from nft sales so what does brand adoption of web 3 mean for the crypto and nft Industry well first when big name brands adopt new web3 products they help create traction among consumers and attract potential investors to web 3. having a brand like Gucci launch nft products in web 3 is like giving their stamp of approval that way other crypto projects feel more legitimate when launching their products and services more web 3 projects stand a chance to access more funding technical support and a larger customer base there's also the trust that customers often place on big name brands which helps stabilize crypto and a t markets overall it's clear that some of the top brands are starting to understand and experiment with web3 however this is just the beginning as more people become familiar with the technology and its potential we can expect even more companies to begin leveraging it in innovative ways what do you think are there any other businesses out there that you think are doing an amazing job with web 3 let us know in the comments below and that wraps it up for what you should know about the top brands in web 3. remember to like subscribe and turn on the notifications for future Alpha see ya,Youtube video,"TOP 6 MAJOR Web2 Brands That Are Taking Over Web3 | @fifa,@nike & more!",2022-10-26 00:00:00,546.0,CoinGecko
05IuuX0uFL4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05IuuX0uFL4,imagine the blockchain as a story building with floors that represent the different layers that make it up hop onto the elevator and let us explore one of the most essential floors in the blockchain building the consensus floor without this floor transaction validation will not take place unlike in centralized system where a central administrator maintains and updates the database decentralized systems disperse this role to different nodes which must reach the same conclusion and agree on the legitimacy of transactions hence the name consensus so in this video we will look at the types of consensus mechanisms besides proof of work and proof of stake but first things first why is consensus important [Music] okay so for starters the blockchain needs a single source of Truth this is at least the short version of the answer to better understand this concept let's first take a step back and get an overview of how the blockchain is set up to work at their core blockchains are databases designed to record and transact information but these are typical characteristics of most databases right so what makes blockchains unique is that the network is distributed therefore cutting out the need for a central Authority it achieves this by relying on a network of distributed nodes so node a could be in South America node B in North Africa node C in Europe and so on even though they are distributed they all work together to maintain the transactions that take place upon the network they all share but most importantly they will need to achieve achieve a common agreement about the blockchain's true state in real time and that is where the consensus mechanisms come in they ensure that all the nodes agree on the legitimacy of the transaction and if so it gets approved and then recorded on the blockchain that said there are different types of consensus mechanisms including the most widespread options proof of work and proof of stake so watch this three minute video to understand the differences between those two but in this video Let's dive into the other type of consensus mechanisms starting with proof of activity which combines the capabilities of proof of work and proof of stake algorithms okay so proof of activity so this mechanism goes through two phases before a completely new block is ready for the blockchain so phase one is known as the proof of workface where my miners compete against each other with their computing power to generate or mine a new block for the blockchain the generated block however is incomplete they do not include transactions instead they are embedded with the block reward address and the transaction title at this point the system switches to proof of stake based on the transaction title information a random group of validators from the blockchain network is selected to validate the new block just like the standard POS the more coins a validator owns the more chances they have of being selected once all the selected validators have signed the block it can be completed and may now be attached to the blockchain now while this method of consensus is secure it still requires a significant amount of energy in its pow phase similarly in its POS phase the wealthy are favored in that they have a higher chance of being selected as validators the most notable platform using POA consensus is decred next up we have proof of authority which unlike proof of stick and proof work is geared toward private organizations who want to build their own chains that don't require participation from General users proof of authority utilizes a reputation based model to help validate transactions and generate new blocks whereby instead of validators placing their coins on the line like improve of stake they Place their reputation the system's validators are pre-selected and approved by other network participants to act as moderators this forces them to confirm their real identities on top of going through a tough selection process which is meant to reduce the risks of selecting questionable validators and incentivize a long-term commitment as you might have guessed this consensus mechanism is relatively centralized since proof of authority blockchains limit the number of validators this however makes the systems highly scalable regardless it is commonly criticized for revealing the identities of validators as it could potentially lead to third-party manipulation for instance say company one uses POA consensus with publicly known validators its competitor may try to influence the validators to act dishonestly in order to compromise its system from within vechain is an example of a popular platform that uses a proof of authority algorithm okay then consensus number three on our list proof of burn is another alternative of pow that tries to be more sustainable improve of burn miners gain the power to mine a block by intentionally and permanently destroying tokens the more tokens a minor burns the higher the chance that they will be selected as the next block validator the idea here is to encourage long-term commitment from miners by demanding that they sacrifice short-term wealth through the burning of their tokens to gain the lifetime privilege to create new blocks burning has other perks like making the coin scarce hence ideally driving up its value and limiting inflation the consensus mechanism also uses far less energy than classic proof of work systems rather than investing in powerful mining Hardware the system incentivizes miners to demonstrate their dedication to the network through intentional token Destruction for example slimcoin a virtual currency allows miners to burn their coins which not only gives them the right to complete for the next block but also gives them the chance to receive blocks for at least a year okay so by now you might have noticed that most of these consensus mechanisms intend to be an improvement upon either proof of work or proof of stake and proof of capacity is no exception as the name suggests it bases its mining algorithm on the amount of space available in a Miner's hard drive before going any further let's draw a quick analogy so say James has 10 basketballs and Joe only has three they are challenged to make at least three shots each with a number of attempts limited to the number of balls that they have so in this case James has the upper hand right so similarly POC stores a list of possible solutions on the mining devices hard drive before mining starts and so the larger the hard drive the higher the capacity to store more solutions this means that miners with more storage space have a higher chance to match the required value from their list resulting in more chances to win the mining reward POC can use any regular hard drives therefore opening the door for regular users to participate making it more decentralized however as it stands not many developers have chosen to adopt to the system and also there have been concerns about the effect of malware attacks on mining activities cryptocurrencies such as Chia and Signum formerly known as briscoin use the POC system okay next up we have the consensus mechanism used by Solana proof of History so this mechanism allows for time stamps to be built into the blockchain itself to prove that a block was created at a certain time so think of it this way say you were present at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and you took photos so you create proof that the photos were taken in during the 2010 World Cup right not before not after because the competition took place at a specific time so similarly with proof of History you basically create a historical record that proves an event took place at a specific time so this mechanism is enabled by what is known as sequential hashing verifiable delay function it works by taking the output of a transaction and using it as input for the next hash which enables everyone to clearly see which event took place in a particular sequence while proof of history is highly scalable validators Hardware needs to meet certain specifications otherwise they are excluded this means that the consensus has to sacrifice decentralization for Speed okay next up we have proof of importance a consensus mechanism that attempts to solve proof of stake's problem of inherently favoring the rich so it achieves this by incorporating additional factors when weighing each note's level of on-chain influence a score is given based on a variety of factors that include but are not limited to the number and size of transactions in a given period so the higher the activity of a node in the network the higher the score and the higher the probability of being chosen to harvest a block and receive the block rewards as mentioned since proof of importance integrates additional metrics the nodes are picked based on the overall support of the network rather than simply the amount staked nem a blockchain launched in 2015 pioneered the proof of importance mechanism to prevent the hoarding of tokens and prioritize users that support the network okay last but not least we have delegated proof of stake one of the evolutions of the proof of a concept whereby users of the network vote and elect delegates to validate the next block for example a crypto user Mary might decide to vote on a certain delegate of her choice by pulling her tokens into a staking pool and linking them to the delegate dpus typically allows 20 to 100 delegates to be chosen for each block also the delegates verifying transactions on one block might not be the delegates for the next after successfully validating a block elected delegates receive transaction fees from the validated block and the reward is then shared with users who pulled their tokens depending on the amount that they staked so dbos is not only fairer through democracy but is also quicker since there are a limited number of delegates currently a number of blockchains including EOS and Tron use dpos ultimately from our non-exhaustive list it's clear that there's no one size fits all when it comes to verifying decentralized systems while pow and POS are certainly the most widespread and adopted consensus mechanisms more of them will surely pop up to try to improve upon the preceding ones so which consensus mechanism do you think should be adopted more by developers well let us know in the comments and of course remember to like subscribe and follow us on all socials for

nM5nlEi0vKk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM5nlEi0vKk,most of us even those with crypto store money in bank accounts just having them in there alone will help you to earn interest but even with all the recent rate hikes some of these numbers might still not tickle your fancy especially for those with a bigger risk appetite so this is why many have ventured to explore other ways to earn passive income now no matter the approach the goal is the same to put your idle funds to work for you one of the ways you can achieve this is through crypto now before we begin we'd like to quickly point out that while you can earn passive income with cryptocurrency in the eight ways that we'll discuss it's not always guaranteed to be a success we all know how volatile cryptocurrencies are right even without a volatile Market factors like inflation and bearish markets can cause you to lose 100 of your investment so before investing in any strategy you should always consider whether the risk involved are worthwhile okay to make the decision easier for you we'll explore eight different ways to earn passive income with crypto okay the first way is through staking so you can think of staking like the stakeholders of a corporation who support the growth and success of the Enterprise in crypto though staking is when you lock up a sum of native crypto Assets in a smart contract to earn yield so how it works is through blockchains like ethereum 2.0 cardano Solana and polka dot that use the proof of stake consensus mechanism in proof of stake users who stake their coins usually for a set period of time can become validators and help secure the network and in exchange get rewarded with newly issued tokens of a particular blockchain now while solo sticking can require a high minimum amount staked there are many staking service providers or pool staking Services which accepts smaller lockup amounts if you're in it for the long haul this is one of the more sustainable and also relatively low risk ways to earn passive income now unless you are Solo staking as a validator it also requires little technical expertise because all you have to do is choose a reputable platform on which to stake your assets okay next up we have yield farming which made waves during the D5 summer of 2020 thanks to the rising popularity of decentralized exchange platforms these platforms rely on liquidity pools which you can invest in by depositing tokens into the liquidity pool on the exchange you'll get to earn a cut of the transaction fees collected for Traders who use these pools now in certain cases you can even deposit the lp tokens received to earn even more tokens while the act of yield farming itself is quite straightforward the risk of impermanent loss might make it hard hard for beginners to gauge whether it's a worthwhile investment not to mention the risk of rug pulls smart contract bugs potential exploits and more like that that said though yield farming is an easy Gateway into defy and could be a sustainable option for passive income okay so we touched a bit on the proof of stay consensus mechanism but there is another popular consensus mechanism that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use called proof of work so in proof of work the validators are called miners who need expensive Computing Hardware to solve complex math equations that keep the blockchain running in exchange they earn newly minted tokens as rewards now not everyone can set up one of those mining operations with ease so instead Cloud mining offers a way for people to rent Computing hashtag power for a set period of time from an already established operation when you rent hashing power you pay for a share of hashing power and split the profits with the contract owner the plus side of subscribing to a cloud mining service provider is that it requires no technical expertise unlike setting up a mining rig on your own and also it can be sustainable in the long run and also low risk to rent out someone else's specialized Hardware but definitely look out for scams and choose a reputable Cloud mining provider okay so the next way to earn passive income is more familiar to those with savings accounts that earn interest so in the same way you could have a crypto interest account that earns you interest so you can compare the rates traditional cash savings accounts offer and see whether opening an account and depositing crypto or stablecoin gives you a better shot now make sure to go over the terms and see what's right for you so due to their technical ease and perception of low risk crypto interest accounts are especially popular among beginners now what all of these could be true do bear in mind that institutions are not infallible as we have seen in recent times okay so still treading on Familiar Grounds you could consider lending crypto Assets in exchange for earning an interest fee paid by borrowers some deposit pools are even further incentivized with token rewards that could help boost the effective interest rate in certain cases rewards are also used to subsidize the costs of borrowing which makes looping an effective farming strategy lending can be sustainable over long periods of time however there is some technical expertise required and also a level of riskiness to it depending on which lending strategy you take some D5 lending protocols to consider are of a compound Banky and Goldfinch just to name a few okay next up is a popular way to earn passive income in the traditional Financial Market though relatively rare in the crypto world so instead of earning interest on crypto assets you can instead earn dividends from the company that issued the tokens all you'll need to do is hold the token and you're automatically eligible to earn a certain percentage of the company's revenue for instance kucoin shares give their holders a daily share of its kucoin blockchain transaction fees in the long run it's pretty sustainable with minimal technical expertise or risk involved so long as the company's token continues to excel you're good to go okay so up to this point we've looked at ways to earned passive income that need you to have some amount of upfront Capital however with forks and air drops you could get free tokens simply by needing certain criteria so Forks happen when an existing blockchain branches off into a new protocol while airdrops happen when free tokens are dropped into users wallets as a reward for performing certain tasks with forks there isn't much you can do in your end other than staying tuned into the crypto ecosystem one example of this being the recent pow Fork after the ethereum merge airdrops on the other hand are more involved where users usually have to meet certain criteria like retweeting a post using a specific wallet trading on a particular platform or creating an account to receive newsletters and regular updates you could say there is some level of technical expertise and airdrops to stay on track and perform as many tasks as possible whereas Forks require less effort aside from scams there is fairly little risk involved in hunting for airdrops if dealing with small amounts of capital however as opportunities for air drops are not as constantly present as options like staking or yield farming and there is no guaran t for large payouts it is not as sustainable in terms of predictability and consistency okay so have you ever participated in a campaign to bring in new clients in exchange for earning Rewards well there are programs like that in crypto too perhaps you have a huge social media following well then you can partner with a platform as an affiliate and earn passive income by bringing in new users alternatively you could share an affiliate link with your contacts to sign up for a platform or submit an application and an exchange earn rewards in some cases you could continue earning passive income each time someone takes a certain action on a given platform though it's not so quick and easy it's certainly one of the easiest low risk and most sustainable ways to earn passive income over time with some ways like airdrops and crypto interest accounts it's pretty simple to get started on others however need some level of technical expertise like setting up wallets and becoming familiar with how the protocol operates in any case these are eight distinct ways to earn passive income each with its own set of opportunities and methods so make sure to carefully weigh the benefits and risk to reward ratio and let us know

CGPNUqQp-x8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGPNUqQp-x8,have you ever bought an nft only to wait for ages before selling it or perhaps you've been hoarding your nft collection because there just isn't a good reason to part with any of them well for a while now liquidity inefficiencies have been a significant barrier for nft Traders but did you know that there is a new project in town pseudo swap wanting to transform the world of nfts if you're not familiar with it yet don't worry I'm gonna explain everything and show you how to make the most of it [Music] day in and day out there's news of a new nft that's being sold for ridiculously high prices but they almost never maintain the same value weeks or months later so this can be very confusing for investors because you just never know how much an nft is worth and so as much as nfts are transforming the digital content creation world as we know it nft Traders continue to face challenges when trading on secondary marketplaces like open C these include censorship issues like copyright strikes which are caused in part by the centralized nature of these marketplaces now there's also the main issue liquidity and efficiency which as an nft Trader amplifies the Pains of bad timing bear markets and other issues so answer is pseudo swap the newest technological Frontier in the nft ecosystem now you may have heard pseudo so I refer to as the unit swap for NFP these and this is because while unit swap allows automated exchanges between tokens pseudoswap allows automated exchanges between nfts so what exactly is sudo swap well pseudoswap also known as Sudo amm is the first decentralized nft Marketplace that uses an automated Market maker amm model to trade nfts and swap them with eth via liquidity pools okay so there is a lot to unpack there so let's break it down a little bit further so as mentioned pseudo swap is an nft Marketplace just like traditional exchanges and popular nft marketplaces like open C users can list their nfts on sudo swap at fixed prices however pseudoswap distinguishes itself from the competition by offering a liquidity pool feature where users provide crypto assets to swap nfts with so this way traders buy and sell nfts from the pool without having to wait for an offer from a specific individual so this is the fundamental concept behind an automated Market maker which is a liquidity model that automates the pricing of nfts each time someone buys or sells an nft right so how is pseudo swap different from other marketplaces like openc well at the moment nft marketplaces and traditional exchange platforms rely on a centralized order book model as compared to the typical amm model for most decentralized exchanges and marketplaces like openc are not actually decentralized and do not have their data posted on chain making them vulnerable to downtime and centralization risks so the difference with pseudo swap is that it's completely on chain it runs on the decentralized ethereum's layer 1 protocol so essentially anyone can transparently interact with the liquidity pools from their wallet apps using e now aside from the pseudosoft decentralized features there also other advantages that the platform offers so let's take a look at some of the other advantages okay so first all of pseudoswap's activities occur on chain now I mentioned this earlier but to get a better perspective on how Innovative this feature is it means that pseudo swap is decentralized and hence non-sensorable plus it offers on-chain advantages like Dows and multi-sig groups the on-chain feature also allows anyone to create a website and display their nfts listed on the crypto exchange now this provides further decentralization through more proxy websites allowing sudo swap to always run through them in case the marketplace ever goes down now another thing sudo swap has minimal fees compared to the alternative marketplaces out there so pseudo swap charges a 0.5 fee which is much less than the usual 7.5 percent which is a 2.5 platform fee plus a five percent royalty fee on other platforms like openc which also means that your profit margin on pseudo swap can be substantially higher and what's more you're free to make bulk purchases and sales so you may end up saving much more on gas fees now there are other advantages like earning trading fees when you contribute your crypto and nfts to the liquidity investment pools just like how you could with liquidity pools on uniswap or sushi swap also pseudo swap's amm model offers additional benefits for instance the amm model helps users maximize their profit by automatically adjusting an item's price based on an item's floor price okay so to explore more of amm services let's look at how pseudo swap's amm model works so the main feature settings do to swap apart from its counterparts is the ability to buy and sell nfts via liquidity to pools based on customizable bonding curves so if a user wants to sell one or more nfts they create a liquidity pool and add their nfts to it other users contribute liquidity to the pool to earn trading fees to buy an nft you'll go to a liquidity pool and make an offer remember that each pool is created and run by a sole liquidity provider it's as simple as that where it gets slightly more complicated though is the pricing so to grasp this further let's take a look at an example so heading over to pseudo swap's popular azuki collection let's select the pools tab on the lower right side currently there are nine pools listed here when we select the first pool we see that there are currently four azuki nfts with 249.336 each the current price of a nazuki nft in this pool is 11.088 eth with bonding curves every nft bot from the pool increases by Delta and every nft sold to the pool decreases the price in the case of this azuki pool every time an nft is bought from the pool the price will go up by two percent also pools don't always have to be buy and sell pools they can be sell only buy only or a liquidity pool where platform fees are earned they can also have a linear bonding curve which means that the price will rise or fall by a fixed amount of heat now what's great about this model is that it lets you leave your nfts on autopilot so you don't have to constantly monitor the prices the platform simply makes purchases or sales for you adjusting the price based on the the price ranges you've specified oh and if you're wondering if pseudoswap has a governance token the answer is yes x-mon is a platform's governance token now for the time being the token serves only as a governance token however time will tell whether the token adds additional utility to the project another thing is that while a lack of royalty fees make Sudo swap a more affordable alternative to other platforms it also means that creators only receive a one-time fee for the first sale of their work and nothing else so obviously nft Traders benefit from lower fees with pseudo swap but creators and artists are bypassed in the potentially multiple resales that occur on pseudo swap now this is one of the challenges that prompted the development of nfts in the first place so what do you think does this mean that we're taking two steps forward and one step back let me know what you think in the comments now getting started on sudo swap is pretty straightforward simply navigate to pseudoswap.xyz and connect your wallet by clicking the connect button in the upper right corner of the page next go to your pools and on the page go to create new pool you can either select one buy nfts with tokens two sell nfts four tokens or three do both and earn protocol fees then select eth and nfts from your wallet on the next page you can set up your pool paying special attention to the bonding curve and Delta features if you select exponential it means you'll denote the Delta amount in percentage while if you select linear you'll denote the Delta amount in E lastly review your settings and click create pool and you're done so what does the future hold for a pseudo swap well up to this point it seems like nft Traders are into it whether the same could be said about creators an artist were made to be seen regardless though pseudo swap shows no signs of slowing down the platform was only recently launched in July yet it's quickly gaining traction among daily users defy Lama reports that pseudo swap's total value increased 2400 from 120 000 to 3 million in just over a month now on Twitter a pseudo swap said that they plan to add support for ERC 1155 erc20 token routing more novel bonding curves and amm management infrastructure so what do you think is pseudoswap the future of nft trading or will pseudoswap be an issue for creators well let us know in the comments below also remember to like subscribe and turn on the notifications for future Alpha see ya foreign [Music],Youtube video,Here's why Sudoswap is CHANGING the

oA1Bl_VyQD0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA1Bl_VyQD0,you've probably seen people use aliases and avatars when trading in cryptocurrency some even launch major crypto projects without revealing their true identity but what happens if their true identity is revealed through doxing how ethical is doxing what even is doxing stay tuned as we answer all these questions and more when Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin anonymity was one of its most prized features it's how to this day no one knows who the person or group of people behind the Satoshi Alias is following satoshi's lead it's become commonplace to see people in the crypto World using pseudonyms from d-apps nfts defy and GameFly to the many blockchain Innovations available most people choose to invent develop and transact on these networks without revealing their identities we've all seen how unchain detectives expose the identities of pseudonymous people some of these are scam artists and malicious hackers While others could just be regular project team members or crypto personalities so what exactly is doxing doxing is when someone searches or hacks your private or identifying information and publishes it on the internet often with malicious intent so essentially when you have an alias or an avatar as your crypto profile and someone reveals your true identity you've been doxxed but how ethical is it to reveal the true identities of people who use aliases or avatars as their crypto profiles I mean there's no rule against anyone posting who you truly are on the internet but is there any sort of community consensus on why doxing matters in crypto if it even does at the moment what's set in stone is crypto users being on the fence about it so while some claim they dox people with good intentions others see it as an act of war against the anonymity fundamentals that make crypto so valuable let's take a quick look at both sides so the yays to doxing claim that doxing is important to establish a Project's credibility especially given the recent trends of top performing crypto project Founders using aliases to launch their work things become much more complicated on such high profile grounds because no one knows who these Founders and the custodians of millions of dollars in investor funds are or what their backgrounds are take for example the recent docs of yoga Labs co-founders which made the board ape Yacht Club nft in the article we found the real names of board ape Yacht Club's pseudonymous Founders BuzzFeed news reporter Katie netopoulos reveals that Yuga Labs aliases Gordon goner and Gargamel are in fact Greg Solano a 32 year old writer and editor and Wiley Arena a 35 year old originally from Florida and while the two are not involved in any illegal activity Katie holds her ground saying how do you hold them accountable if you don't know who they are in Katie's opinion doxing the people behind board ape Yacht Club success was necessary to establish the Project's credibility she believes that using real names should be a basic requirement just as it's required for publicly traded companies by the Securities and Exchange Commission and smaller firms via know your customer kyc laws some argue that doxing is a necessary step in tracking crypto scammers the claim is that some of these Founders may have a shady history that may suggest that they are attempting to pull off another scam for instance in the recent Ox sifu doxing Crackdown the CFO of the D5 protocol Wonderland money going by the Alias oxifu was revealed on Twitter to be the co-founder of the defunct quadriga CX exchange Michael Patron now if you're unfamiliar this is the same scandal in which quadriga cx's founder Gerald cotton vanished with 169 million dollars forcing the company to close in 2018 kind of like what's been happening with rug pools what's more Michael Patron was convicted of fraud in the United States in 2005 under yet another Alias Omar danani following these Revelations aksifu stepped down as Wonderland CFO with the D5 protocol seemingly operating as normal the Nays however are coming in with an entirely new angle that as much as doxing helps build trust in crypto projects doxing people involuntarily is a cause for concern especially when there's no risk that would cause you to reveal a person's identity crypto podcaster Kobe commented on Katie's doxing article saying if your investigation returns nothing and you still dox people anyway are you really a journalist it stems from one of the primary goals of cryptocurrency which is anonymous transactions true false identities are used in cryptocurrency scams a good example is the squid Game Rug pool and other scams that you can watch here where the perpetrators remain unknown there's also the risk of having your identity exposed to the world especially since there have been reports of people using physical Force to coerce cryptocurrency owners into handing over private keys to their wallets in the meantime you need to be cautious at all times because dachshund doesn't just happen to crypto Founders when you post statements like sure just send the die to ethismoney.eath or I just paid .02 Ethan gas fees why is gas so expensive you're essentially publicizing your entire transaction history to the world yes your public address is pseudonymous however once you post it on social media you're essentially telling the world hey there that's my wallet address or hey these are the details for my last transaction and once someone links your identity to your address or a single transaction they can pretty much trace your transaction history on the publicly accessible Ledger that is the blockchain so here's an idea don't dox yourself practice what's called good address hygiene here are a few pointers for practicing good address hygiene to avoid being doxxed first use multiple addresses using just one address makes it easy for someone to trace your total net worth instead split your addresses and diversify your aliases you could maybe use one address for defy and another for buying nfts in either case your funds will be spread across multiple addresses making it more difficult to connect them all next don't transact directly between your private and public addresses always keep your public and private addresses separate you could use your public address when interacting with a network but when transferring assets from your private address practice using a mixer such as a centralized exchange that way when your transaction records are via a mixer exchange platform the transaction history becomes more dispersed and difficult to trace lastly use Brave a VPN and tour for extra privacy when you use a brave browser it allows you to block cross-site trackers third-party cookies and other security holes you should also always clear cookies and your local storage when switching between your private and public accounts and lastly use a VPN or tour to hide your online activity from potential hackers while it's difficult to avoid doxing completely you can take extra precautions to limit your exposure to malicious intent as much as possible but as cryptocurrencies become more popular it will be interesting to see how doxing evolves alongside them will there be good doctors out there dedicated to revealing the true identities of scammers or will regulations compel cryptocurrency projects to implement kyc procedures only time will tell and that wraps it up for what you should know about doxing remember to like

xOfI_Pz18y4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOfI_Pz18y4,hey there have you ever played find the egg no well yeah I just kind of made that up but let's play it anyway so say there are three eggs arranged side to side on a moving conveyor egg one has one line drawn on it egg two has two lines while X3 has three lines all you have to do is identify each egg at the end of the conveyor light work right well there is a small twist each egg passes through the mixer box an enclosed segment that ensures each egg has three lines drawn and also shuffles the position of the eggs so at the end of the conveyor each egg has three identical lines and sits at a different position so can you still with certainty identify eggs one two and the original egg three it's a lot harder Now isn't it so this is kind of an illustration of how tornado cash a non-custodial privacy solution tries to improve transaction privacy between the recipient and destination address so in this video we will find out more about the Privacy protocol including how it works and also stick to the end to find out about the US government sanctions on the protocol all right let's get to it someone might ask is there really a need for a privacy protocol when users identities are hidden on the blockchain while it's true that the blockchain is pseudonymous it is not at all Anonymous simply put when your identity is hidden the trace of your transactions is not in fact the blockchain has helped the authorities in Catching criminals before due to this high level of transparency some privacy-oriented crypto users look to privacy Solutions such as Monero and Z cash however these projects run on their native networks hence they can't provide privacy to other chains now that is what led to the birth of tornado cash so what is tornado cash and what does it do so tornado cash is simply a blockchain privacy solution it enables ethereum users to break links in on-chain transactions by allowing them to send eth and erc20 deposits through its smart contract Service and with withdraw their crypto to a new address such that there is no link between the deposit and the withdrawal address so let's find out what happens behind the scenes like zcash and Monero tornado cash employs zero knowledge proof a way of doing authentication that lets one party prove to the other parties that they know a secret without revealing what the secret is now we have a detailed video explaining how this authentication method works so check that one out right here okay so let's take a look at an example so we have John here now for John to make a tornado cash deposit he generates a secret and sends its hash called a commitment along with his desired deposit amount to the tornado smart contract now the contract accepts John's deposit and adds the commitment tied to his amount to its list of deposits later when John decides to make a withdrawal he will need to provide proof that he possesses a secret to unspent commitment from from the list of deposits without revealing any piece of potentially identifying information so this is where the zero knowledge technology comes in it allows John to provide proof without revealing which exact deposit matches the secret the smart contract will check the proof and transfer deposited funds to the address specified for the withdrawal by John at this point it will be difficult for anyone to determine which deposit John's withdrawal comes from now while users like John might be legitimate the protocol has been popular among illicit actors and this has caught Regulators attention so on the 8th of August the U.S treasury sanctioned tornado cash for allegations of helping North Korean hackers launder billions of dollars of crypto the office of foreign asset control a regulatory agency under the U.S treasury responsible for imposing sanctions prohibited U.S crypto users and businesses from interacting with the protocol according to the treasury tornado Kash has laundered over 7 billion however this is the total amount of money that has been processed through tornado cash including the majority which was not necessarily related to criminal activity according to blockchain analytics from elliptic about 1.5 billion dollars of illegally obtained funds have been laundered using tornado cash this includes the 445 million hacked by the Lazarus group a famous North korean-based hacked entity already serving U.S us sanctions on top of that the treasury said hackers use tornado cash to launder almost 7.8 million in stolen Assets in the recent Nomad heist where attackers exploited a bug to steal over 100 million in cryptocurrencies as such the treasury blamed tornado cash for failing to implement adequate measures to stop Hackers from using it for money laundering activities now tornado cash started to feel the heat immediately after the ban as the treasury blacklisted 38 ethereum wallets and six uscc wallets belonging to the protocol shortly after Circle uscc's issue were blacklisted all ethereum addresses owned by tornado cash listed in the U.S treasury Department sanctioned against the protocol now that said the U.S government would not sanction a tool that did not work as it stands it's clear that governments are struggling to deal with tools like to know technologically because merely hours into the sanctions someone trolled celebrities like Jimmy Fallon Brian Armstrong and Logan Paul by sending eth from tornado cash to their public ethereum address in an attempt to demonstrate that the recent sanctions cannot easily be enforced all in all the U.S treasury's move was met with controversy because this time they sanctioned software rather than companies or individuals and the ban could be a significant turning point for digital assets as it demonstrates the extent the U.S government is willing to go in its efforts to regulate cryptocurrency well then what will come of similar projects going forward

ktZjf2CxFvE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktZjf2CxFvE,ethereum might be one of the few projects in crypto that suffers from its own success which says a lot about its rise in adoption while this is a good thing it comes with its challenges especially High fees and network congestion but the crypto industry is a hotbed for projects solely focused on solving problems and for ethereum this comes in the form of layer 2 Solutions arbitrim is one of the several layer 2 networks providing scaling solutions for ethereum so in this video we will find out more about arbitrim and its latest development stick till the end to find out the top five projects on the network alright let's start off by finding out more about the scaling solution how it works and what makes it unique let's get into it arbit room helps decongest ethereum by executing transactions on its chain and only recording the output on ethereum this scaling technology is known as a roll-up as the transactions on arbitrim are rolled up into one transaction recorded on the ethereum main net but wait a minute how can ethereum verify the correctness without executing the transactions well this is where proofs come in arbitrim specifically uses optimistic roll-up technology which relies on fraud proves that assume posted data is valid unless challenged from the name they are basically optimistic in the sense that when they post the updated state to ethereum they do this without posting any proof at all so a quick example say James post a roll-up block containing a claim about what is the correct outcome of executing some transactions other nodes who are incentivized to submit only valid claims execute the same transactions and compose a challenge if they disagree with John's claim now keep in mind also that there is another type of rollout technology known as zero knowledge Roll-Ups which also execute transactions off chain but instead of fraud proofs they rely on validity proofs now validity proofs pose batches of transactions through cryptographic proofs called ZK snarks that said currently arbitrim has two live chains the newly launched arbitrim Nova optimized for gaming and social applications and arbitrim1 arbitrim's Flagship product which is a scaling solution for D5 and nfts now since its public launch in 2021 its ecosystem has been growing fast so here are top five projects on arbitrim right now at number one we have GM mix a decentralized spot and Perpetual exchange first built on arbitrim and currently the biggest project by total value locked on the Chain gmx's decentralized spot training protocol allows investors to perform cryptocurrency swaps its most popular product is the decentralized Perpetual contract trading platform where Perpetual contract Traders could use up to 30 times leverage on the GMX exchange at the core functionality of the GMX exchange is a community-owned and unionized liquidity pool the pool serves users in two major ways first it is used by the automated Market maker to serve the decentralized spot exchange now second the leveraged trading algorithm uses the glp pool to service loan requests by Traders who can borrow up to 30 times the value of their collateral now note that derivatives trading is very risky and is not advisable for beginners so feel free to watch our video on crypto derivatives right here okay at number two we have uniswap one of the biggest dexes by tvl and D5 the decks came up with the automated Market maker model that allows users to trade without a counterparty and only against a liquidity pool controlled by a smart contract users have a variety of products to use from swapping tokens to providing liquidity and staking their tokens unit swap launched on arbitrum in August 2021 to allow its users to enjoy low gas costs and Speedy transactions the platform has a tvl of over 101 million on arbitrim at the time of making this video making it the second biggest project in the chain then uniswap's rival Sushi swap is also an arbitrum the decks launched as a hard Fork of uniswap and has grown to be one of the most popular decentralized exchanges in D5 as one of the earliest projects to get into arbitrum Sushi swap allows users to swap different tokens borrow and land and provide liquidity all without giving up custody of their funds the platform has a tvl of over 90 million in Arboretum at the time of making this video okay next up on the list is Stargate a fully composable cross-chain Bridge protocol that enables native asset transfers between different blockchain networks so Stargate tries to solve the issue with traditional bridges that are unable to send native assets from one chain to another and instead rely on the use of a wrap token to complete the bridging process basically Stargate is designed to let users send native tokens directly to non-native chains through unified liquidity pools shared between chains the project is one one of the biggest on arbitrum despite being only a couple of months old okay last but not least we have curve a project working towards becoming the biggest amm for stable coins curve has many similarities to platforms like uniswap but differentiates Itself by only accommodating liquidity pools made up of similarly behaving assets like stable coins or rap versions of similar assets such as wbtc and tbtc by focusing on stable coins it allows investors to avoid more volatile crypto assets and focus on stability rather than speculation so the race to be the number one scaling solution for ethereum is truly on an arbitrum seems to be one of the favorites as it stands that's it whichever project takes its place as the dominant scaling solution the real winners will be the users and developers who will get to enjoy faster and cheaper transactions without sacrificing security so which project do you see becoming ethereum's dominant scaling solution in the coming years arbitrim optimism or polygon well give us your thoughts

aBFRRGR4aqY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBFRRGR4aqY,what's not been said about Bitcoin from having the potential to change the world to being a scam worse than the Tulip Mania we all know that crypto has always been narrative driven one tweet from Elon Musk can send prices skyrocketing or plummeting depending on the message today we're looking back at the most famous and influential people's quotes on bitcoin to see where they stand is it going to be bull or bare let's find out shall we number 10 Jack ma let's start off with Jack Ma's sentiments blockchain technology could change our world More Than People imagine Bitcoin however could be a bubble it's not uncommon for influential people to hold opposing views on bitcoin as a virtual currency and blockchain Technology here's what Jack ma the co-founder and former executive chairman of Alibaba group said to reporters at the launch of a blockchain-based remittance service honestly I'm not that big fan of Bitcoins but behind the Bitcoin the technology itself really very powerful though he holds some reservations about Bitcoin specifically ma is bullish about the potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize a number of Industries in fact Alibaba has been investing heavily in developing its own blockchain platforms number nine Bill Gates when asked about his thoughts on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates told a Reddit user I don't own any I like investing in things that have valuable output I don't own Bitcoin I'm not short Bitcoin I'm not bullish on bitcoin and you know my general thought would be that you know if you have less money than Elon you should probably uh watch out these words by gates are interesting it shows that he believes that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may not have much intrinsic value as opposed to more tangible assets like stocks or Commodities number eight Jamie dimon Jamie dimon the CEO of JPMorgan Chase also has strong feelings about Bitcoin Bloomberg famously quoted him saying the cryptocurrency won't end well it will eventually blow up it is a fraud definitely worse than tulip bulbs I personally think that Bitcoin is worthless but I don't want to be explosive but I don't care it makes no difference to me according to Jamie dimon Bitcoin will happen in more or less the same way as the Tulip Mania that was quite popular during the Dutch Golden Age with the price of tulips skyrocketing in 1634 only to plummet dramatically in 1637. number seven Warren Buffett then there is Warren Buffett the eighth richest man in the world and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway one of crypto's most bearish players who told CNBC that in terms of cryptocurrencies generally I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending but it doesn't end there he's described Bitcoin as rat poison and no currency at all he claims that he doesn't own any cryptocurrency and never will when asked why he does not invest in cryptocurrency Warren says I I get enough trouble with things I think I know something about why in the world should I take a long or short position of something I don't know anything about it makes sense given how many people have fallen victim to crypto scams due to a lack of understanding of what crypto is all about Warren goes on to explain his thoughts on the utility of cryptocurrency he asserts that cryptocurrencies basically have no value and they don't produce anything it doesn't reproduce it doesn't it doesn't deliver it can't mail you a check it can't do anything and what you hope is that somebody else comes along and pays you more money for it later on but then that person's got the problem but in terms of value you know zero Warren is right in that cryptocurrencies don't have any inherent value their value comes from what people are willing to pay for them something which is also true for normal currencies not just crypto but not all cryptocurrency comments are negative some influential people have been known to be strongly optimistic about Bitcoin number six Mike novogratz for example Mike novogratz the CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners which focuses on cryptocurrency investments has had a lot to say about Bitcoin including that Bitcoin will lead the markets back out of this this fed Titan the moment the fed flinches the moment you know pal pauses because the economy is really starting to roll over you're going to see Bitcoin explode North this was after bitcoin's price dropped in June 2022 along with the broader market crash as a result of investors responding to high inflation rates however Mike remained optimistic that Bitcoin would pull through number five Jack Dorsey the former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey also had some noteworthy remarks about Bitcoin in particular our quote suggesting he may be transitioning to working on Bitcoin in some way Bitcoin changes absolutely everything I don't think there's anything more important in my lifetime to work on like if I were not at square or Twitter I'd be working on bitcoin if it needed more help then square and Twitter I would leave them for Bitcoin well we suppose this gives a pretty good idea of where Jack Dorsey T will be going next number four Hal Finney Hal Finney a pgp corporation developer is a well-known figure in the Bitcoin Community while he died in 2014 long before bitcoin's meteoric rise one of his most famous quotes provided a fresh perspective so early on in the game he said since we're all rich with Bitcoins we ought to put some of this unearned wealth to good use while subtle this quote suggests a culture of giving back and helping others through Bitcoin he definitely saw the great potential that Bitcoin holds number three Michael Saylor then there's the Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor CEO of microstrategy yet another strong advocate of Bitcoin he's known to rival Elon Musk for top Bitcoin bullish quotes with some of his best ones being Bitcoin is the solution everything else is noise Bitcoin is digital gold growing harder smarter faster and stronger and my formula for success is Rise early work late and buy Bitcoin while he's a respected investor who's received several accolades in his field his quotes are widely used as memes with some people choosing to no longer take him seriously Michael Saylor's company microstrategy holds the biggest chunk of Bitcoin with a whopping 129 698 Bitcoins valued at 3 billion US Dollars talk about putting your money where your mouth is number two Elon Musk next up is Elon Musk who I'm sure you've heard a quote or two about cryptocurrencies from he is Tesla's CEO and is regarded as one of the most influential crypto Bulls in the world here's one of his quotes from an invitation only social media app Clubhouse and I think Bitcoin is really on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional Finance people the quote is no less valid today more businesses and governments accept cryptocurrency is a form of payment including an estimated quarter of small businesses in nine countries around the world today Tesla is second among the top companies that hold the most Bitcoins in the world it holds around ten thousand eight hundred Bitcoins currently valued at 268 million US Dollars you can also watch our video of the top 10 companies with the biggest Bitcoin portfolios at the link here number one Satoshi Nakamoto and lastly we have the father of Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym for the person or people who created and launched Bitcoin in 2009. during a Bitcoin Forum discussion about scalability and transaction rates in 2010 Satoshi claimed that Bitcoin has payment processors that can verify payments in 10 seconds or less at a much lower fraud rate than credit cards Satoshi Nakamoto Then followed up with this famous quote if you don't believe it or don't get it I don't have the time to try to convince you sorry true satoshi's quote may appear dismissive if not downright rude however in 2010 Bitcoin was a completely new concept that most people were unfamiliar with today many forums have sprung up to simplify the understanding of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies nonetheless it's safe to say that Bitcoin is the type of technology that needs time and effort to learn on your own there are certainly many more voices speaking out about Bitcoin on the one hand some influential people are very bullish about bitcoin's future on the other hand Bitcoin remains a mystery particularly in terms of how it works and the value it brings

4Exe6SLU6lE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Exe6SLU6lE,have you heard about the flightless birds that have been taking off recently pudgy Penguins an nft project that saw itself in a rough patch recently seems to be picking up again despite the so-called nft winter in this video we are gonna dive into the rise fall and Redemption of pudgy Penguins stick till the end to find out the penguin nft that was sold for over 600 thousand dollars for wait for it simply looking the other way but wait a minute what are pudgy Penguins nfts anyway think pfps like board apes or crypto punks but for cute and chubby Penguins The Collection has 888 penguins that are unique and randomly generated from over 150 hand-drawn traits its launch came in the middle of the nft bull run in 2021 and the timing couldn't be more perfect in less than 20 minutes The Collection was sold out and within a week its floor price was as high as 2.4 ether remember the Superstar left-looking penguin we mentioned at the beginning of the video in September 2021 a collector shelled out 225 ether for it in amount worth nearly 1 million dollars at the time to say that pudgy Penguins had an impressive start is an understatement besides its success in the market the project received a lot of attention from mainstream Outlets like the New York Times which featured it on its front page with the amount of hype around it you wouldn't be out of line if you suggested that the Penguins would surpass board ape Yacht Club's floor price then however it was not long till things started spiraling downhill in December 2021 came the first nail in the coffin some trouble in pudgy penguin Paradise between the founding team and one of the Discord mods Darth who is being promoted into a more formal Community manager role Darth expressed dissatisfaction with his compensation on Twitter and also accused the project leaders of trying to bribe him in equating him to a low-skilled worker who is not worthy of higher pay the Saga went on as the founders later launched their own Twitter space to do some damage control and try to minimize the Fallout from the Darth situation as expected penguin's floor price took a hit but shortly after recovered however the killer blow came on Christmas day back in August holders were airdropped in new nft of an egg that would hatch on Christmas day there was a lot of speculation and excitement around the hatch as no one knew what the nft egg would contain on December 25th the eggs did indeed hatch only to reveal fishing rods the community felt like this was a massive letdown and was Furious because all through the founders were benefiting from royalties to appease the angry Community they launched a little Pudgies collection but the Divide was clear eventually talks between the pudgy Penguins Founders and a project whale that goes by 9x 9x eth on Twitter surfaced with 9x9x9 accusing the team of trying to unload the project to cash in on its success the team subsequently drained the treasury and withdrew nearly 4 000 ether in total to their personal coinbase accounts this was the final nail in the coffin the community had had enough and held a public vote on Discord to oust the founders fast forward to April 2022 the project was handed a Lifeline as the co-founder sold the collection and rights to a group led by Los Angeles entrepreneur Luca schnetzler a longtime fan of the project for around 2.5 million dollars after the Takeover it seemed like Pudgie's long-awaited Redemption Arc was taking shape as the Project's new leadership went all in on re-establishing the project since the April acquisition pudgy Penguins has launched its nft Marketplace clothing and toy lines a media hub and grown at social media presence plus the project introduced The star-packed nine-member Advisory Board consisting of heavyweights such as nanson's Alex vonovic and Jordan Sterling who work on meta's Venture Capital Partnerships team these developments and a series of announcements were more than enough to Kindle the ignition for Pudgie's recent takeoff the floor price spiked in the recent month and as of making this video it sits at over three ether pudgy siblings little Pudgies and Pudgy rods have also enjoyed similar success to their elder brother as promised at the beginning of the video here is the pudgy penguin that fetched over six hundred thousand dollars this gray penguin looks plain compared to others but is the only left-facing penguin making it the rarest in the collection All Things Considered pudgy Penguins Journey so far has been a roller coaster ride to say the least but its comeback has been impressive it seems the penguins are currently in good hands with Luca schnetzler driving more

vSPW2b5ZIRs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSPW2b5ZIRs,did you know that scientists have linked Financial loss with feelings of fear and pain in the brain plus when individuals experience Financial loss the brain takes note and remembers to react strongly to similar future events so this is why investors tend to make irrational decisions in the bear market and even repeat the same mistakes in the future so today we will look at five common mistakes to avoid during a crypto bear market now look out for mistake number five you might be making it unknowingly alright let's get into it okay mistake number one panic selling bear markets are riddled with panic selling just like bull markets are associated with buying due to fomo making financial decisions based on emotions is generally a bad idea during a bear Market when investors begin to panic they open the door to fear and anxiety once this happens they tend to throw their game plans out the window and end up making emotional decisions devoid of logic now of course there's no way to magically ensure that you won't panic when prices plummet but there are a few good tips on avoiding Panic selling for instance keeping in mind that no asset goes up in a straight line there will be bumps along the journey especially crypto which is notorious for being extremely volatile now there's really no way of tackling this fact except for accepting it so be prepared to weather storms remembering why you invested in the first place was it for short-term gains or are you playing the long game now if you're focused on the long-term gains be psychologically prepared to sit through prolonged Market downturns by sticking to your initial strategy also checking the price list frequently won't hurt either okay mistake number two trying to time the bottom so the market is falling and Jane an investor decides she wants to try timing the bottom to scoop up an asset at the absolute cheapest price so she's basically attempting to execute the oldest game plan in the book buying low and selling High a pretty Swift and painless method or is it well this is one of the most common mistakes made by investors during bear markets you can be an expert on Technical on-chain and fundamental analysis but even then you will have to rely on your gut feeling when trying to time the bottom that is why timing the market is a losing game so let's say Jane decides to place a significant buy of an asset at what appears to be to her to be the bottom at that given time however the price drops even further and now she may not have the same Capital to deploy or she has to sell and try to time the bottom again so clearly this strategy is not sustainable and could easily lead to significant losses alternatively Jane might think that an asset would continue to drop lower to a certain price but it never does in this case Jane does not manage to enter a desired position in the market risking getting Left Behind if and when the market turns around so the cost of waiting for the perfect moment to invest May exceed the benefit of perfect timing and timing the bottom perfectly would be based on luck and is nearly impossible anyway so avoid timing the market and instead make a plan and invest accordingly so a common strategy used by investors instead of attempting to time the market is known as dollar cost averaging or DCA it involves breaking down your investment into smaller chunks and buying small amounts of an asset at specific intervals over a period of time regardless of the price so instead of Jane trying to time the market and buy seven hundred dollars of an asset all at once she may instead invest fifty dollars in the asset weekly for 14 weeks so dollar cost averaging has some unique benefits so make sure to watch our video video right here to find out all right on to mistake number three leaving your crypto on exchanges generally speaking it is not advisable to keep large amounts of cryptocurrency in any hot wallet especially in exchange account instead it is suggested that you withdraw the majority of funds to your own personal cold wallet this is emphasized even more in Bear markets as the risks of permanently losing your funds stored in these exchanges become even bigger then it is common for the bear Market to impact several elements of the cryptocurrency sector including crypto exchanges Market crashes lead to billions of dollars being wiped out from the market causing many exchanges to end up insolvent okay on to mistake number four leverage trading now this point relates to any other time too and not just during bear markets however we're getting wrecked with leverage during a bear Market can be especially brutal inexperienced investors may be tempted to take on Leverage to enter positions out of greed or perhaps Revenge trade in an attempt to make back what they lost or make up for missing out on gains during the bull market however it amplifies your potential losses and in some cases you can lose more money than you have available so learn to accept that the past is the past and instead of making rash decisions stick to your well-planned strategy and focus on the present now last but not least mistake number five ignoring your mental health for most if not all of the mistakes that we have just covered there was a running theme of emotional decisions leading to financial losses so this tends to happen when you don't keep your mental health in check as we have mentioned you should accept that crypto is an extremely volatile asset class so extreme Rises and falls and prices will be common if you invested in a project because you believe in its potential in 5 10 or 15 years there's no need to sweat over fluctuations in its price now right also remember that there is life outside of crypto so don't get carried away and lose sight of other things in life take care of yourself and also your mental health have enough crypto to be happy if it goes up and also enough elsewhere to survive if it goes down so have you made any of these mistakes before well let me know in the comments I would love to know also remember to like subscribe and follow us on

cvaNAdtQWI8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvaNAdtQWI8,[Laughter] whether it's will smith's iconic oscars slap or the famous dog name that spawned dogecoin it's near impossible to go a day without hearing about the latest meme in town like it or not meme coins have taken over the crypto market by storm with whopping valuations up in the billions the two most popular meme coins for instance dogecoin and shiba inu command close to 10 billion in market cap respectively making them two of the highest valued projects in all of crypto it's expected for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum to make waves in the crypto world due to their applications but when it comes to mean coins what is their value why are they so popular and what is their future let's find out what exactly are meme coins memes are images videos or other forms of media typically created for humor there is a social element too whereby memes are created and spread from person to person on the internet in fact memes are an important part of internet culture that drives the latest trends in the same way meme coins are created by drawing inspiration from viral memes keep in mind that anyone can create a new cryptocurrency and call it anything they want despite the original intention of creating meme coins which was to create a coin meant to be shared within a crypto community purely for entertainment purposes some meme coins are making waves in the crypto market snagging celebrity endorsements and skyrocketing in value up to billions of dollars and while such rapid growth may imply that these meme coins are valuable the truth is that the vast majority of these coins have no underlying use case sure they are designed like many other altcoins but they have no utility whatsoever which begs the question if meme coins are based on a viral moment in time why are they so popular while several factors influence the value of a cryptocurrency one of the biggest drivers for crypto is social media hype one fomo let's say a close friend mark told you he'd made a million by investing in a new meme coin in town you might be tempted to jump on board and invest a portion of your own money many others may join you causing the popular fomo we are constantly reminded to avoid and as word spreads and social media is flooded with hype many people begin to invest in the meme coin increasing demand and causing the coins value to skyrocket two celebrity endorsements some meme coins may receive celebrity endorsements boosting their popularity even further just like social media influencers encourage people to buy a certain product people often buy celebrity endorsed meme coins because they trust the celebrity's judgment or want to be like them dogecoin prices for example have been known to rise in tandem with elon musk's tweets about the coin when he tweeted that tesla would accept dogecoin as payment for some merchandise doge prices increased by more than 20 percent other celebrities who have come out to endorse some coins include jake paul mark cuban and kim kardashian among others three strong community alternatively meme coins foster a strong community and a sense of belonging if all of your friends and your favorite celebrities are all part of the shebe army you'll want to join in too some meme coins even allow their community to dictate the project's direction providing even more incentive to buy the meme coins token 4. utility despite the fact that most meme coins have no utility there's a new wave of meme coins that combine the meme aspect of a coin with the utility of its protocol this new era of meme coins may gain popularity due to initial meme hype but they often maintain their popularity by providing additional economic value that further develops their brand for instance the dogecoin community launched dogechain a new blockchain platform that allows dogecoin users to use doge tokens to access nft defy gaming and other web3 features on the dogechain network this next step for dogecoin helps to increase the power of doge from just a meme coin to a token with which users can access smart contract features on dogechain 5. financial upside certain meme coins like safe moon for instance brand themselves as a money making machine with a reflection mechanism the idea is that just by passive holding safe moon you'll be able to earn more safe moon for most people this didn't work out well for them since safe moon was allegedly outed as a fraud regardless the idea of getting rich quickly has always been one of the biggest driving forces behind meme coins popularity top meme coins let's take dogecoin for example the original and mother of all meme coins developers billy marcus and jackson palmer created dogecoin as a joke in 2013. the coin was inspired by the popular shiba imu dog meme as you've probably seen displayed in doge images in fact the developers claim the name doge is a deliberate misspelling of the word dog to emphasize the coin's concept as a meme coin but to their surprise dogecoin began to gain a large following propelling its price up to 11th place among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap so what exactly influenced the explosive growth of a coin with no intrinsic value social media hype has influenced the volatile prices of dogecoin aside from being a form of virtual currency dogecoin has no utility or use case however when elon musk tesla's ceo and dogecoin's most high-profile endorser began tweeting about dogecoin and proclaimed himself the doge father investors and influencers jumped on the doge bandwagon propelling its value to an all-time high of 88 billion dollars in may 2021. pretty cool huh the dogecoin craze has faded over the months but even now its market cap is still over 10 billion making it a top 10 coin by market cap following in dogecoin's footsteps shiba inu widely regarded as the dogecoin killer was created in 2020 by an anonymous person named ryoshi despite having no fundamental use case shiba inu is performing reasonably well ranking 12th among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap and although the coins market cap peaked at 41 billion dollars in october 2021 it's currently trading at just nine billion dollars likely you've also heard of other meme coins that are doing relatively well like dogelin mars which was inspired by elon musk's stream of establishing a colony on mars or dogedash inspired by the sonic and mario games or losercoin which has an interesting backstory inspiring a community of losers hoping to make a fortune and succeed quite recently the will smith oscars slap inspired yet another mean coin will smith enu which saw a 459 increase in value in just 24 hours that's before turning around and losing 80 of its value in 36 hours some meme coins like squid inspired by the popular netflix show squid games were outright scams that stole millions of users investment money the squid coins price dropped from a peak of roughly 2 850 straight to zero in a matter of minutes and what is now known as a rug pool crypto scam with so many risks involved you may start to wonder what the future looks like for meme coins firstly long-term value for any investment is frequently derived from the economic value it brings to the table however most meme coins have no such value they are purely for entertainment and have no use case other than for trading and speculation now some meme coins do have utility and even real use cases that have been adopted by high profile brands and businesses for example mark cuban the owner of the dallas mavericks has decided to accept dogecoin as payment for tickets and merchandise and he's not alone companies like tesla gamestop and amc entertainment have expressed interest in accepting dogecoin which will increase its adoption and usage further increasing its value there's also an emerging trend to create meme coins with utility such as floki enu as a metaverse game an nft marketplace and a crypto education platform or paw ethereum to support animal charities in closing while we've covered just a few of the hundreds and thousands of meme coins available on the market the majority of which have seen their market cap drop significantly or flatten the zero it's clear how volatile meme coins can be even for crypto standards make sure to always do your own

4NfUfq2u1KE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NfUfq2u1KE,not so long ago we made a video about the ethereum name service or ens an nft domain name project that allows you to create a human readable name for your cryptocurrency wallet addresses and non-censored website in this video we'll go over a competitor service called unstoppable domains that does the same thing but in a slightly different way so you know that long complicated wallet address that you must remember before sending cryptocurrency to someone else well thanks to services like ens and unstoppable domains you no longer have to remember those addresses with random letters and numbers instead wallet addresses can now be represented by more readable easier to remember names all right let's get into it so what is unstoppable domains unstoppable domains is a decentralized service that lets you create a human readable name to represent as many wallet addresses as you want and optionally use it to build a non-censored website unstoppable domains just closed a 65 million series a funding round bringing its valuation to 1 billion and establishing it as a unicorn so then how does unstoppable domains work you can think of unstoppable domains as similar to the internet's domain name system dns which allows users to create centralized human readable domain names like google.com or coingecko.com for their websites the internet needs ip addresses to route websites to their intended destinations however ip addresses are difficult to remember so as a result dns maps a human readable domain like google.com to google's ip address allowing the computer to recognize google.com as the user requesting to access google's website however unlike the domain names we use on the internet unstoppable domains allow users to create nft domains that run on the blockchain for example we could create coingecko.crypto to represent coingecko's wallet address where any user can type coingecko.crypto when they want to send cryptocurrency to our bitcoin wallet instead of the longer more complicated all of these letters and numbers right here now it is worth noting that unstoppable domains are powered by two blockchains ethereum and silica nine out of the ten extensions available on unstoppable domains are hosted on ethereum these are dot bitcoin dot blockchain dot crypto dot coin dot dao dot nft dot wallet dot x and dot eight eight eight the extension for silica is dot zil choosing the best extension for you is determined by a number of factors including popularity price availability and use case now unstoppable domains are decentralized and uncensored traditionally users register domain names through certified domain name registrars overseen by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers or i can to obtain a domain name with the popular.com.org or net extensions you must lease it from a certified registrar and pay an annual fee to continue owning it in the case of unstoppable domains users register nft domains on the blockchain and since unstoppable domains are minted as nfts users are free to buy and sell unstoppable domains as they wish as nfts on secondary marketplaces like openc now you may be wondering how unstoppable domains differ from the ethereum name service ens so firstly unstoppable domains run on both ethereum and silica blockchain platforms and mints new nft domains on the layer 2 protocol polygon but ens runs and mints new nft domains solely on ethereum then for supported cryptocurrencies unstoppable domains support more than 275 plus coins and tokens from multiple chains including ethereum binance chain ethereum classic solana omni and more ens also has multi-chain support which as of october 2019 was as many as 10 cryptocurrencies but that may be much more today then unstoppable domains distinguishes itself through its no renewal fee business model in which you only pay a one-time fee typically ranging between 10 to all the way up to 25 000 which you can pay in a variety of currencies including fiat and cryptocurrency however ens subscriptions expire after the registration period so you must renew them on a regular basis the fees vary depending on the number of characters but typically range from five dollars to six hundred and forty dollars per year payable in eth similarly unstoppable domains has negligible gas and minting fees because it mints on polygon a layer 2 protocol with greater scaling due to the rampant network congestion on the layer 1 ethereum protocol ens may sometimes have high gas and minting fees now there is no governance token for unstoppable domains but ens has one with its popular governance token airdrop taking place in november 2021 another distinction is that unstoppable domains preserve popular brand names celebrity names or major ip addresses while ens is a permissionless protocol that allows anyone to buy any domain they want and lastly we have the extensions available where unstoppable domains offers 10 extensions including dot x dot crypto dot coin dot wallet dot bitcoin dot 888 dot nft dow dot zil dot blockchain while ens offers the native suffix nativesuffix.eth okay now that we've seen what unstoppable domains are all about let's go over how to buy an unstoppable domain step by step okay first go to unstoppabledomains.com type the domain name you want into the search bar hit the search button and you'll see a list of domains that are available and unavailable so the unavailable domains are reserved for brands and or well-known trademark owners and you can apply for them by clicking learn more and filling out the protected brand's form now we want to buy unreserved domains so scroll down to the suggested names section which displays a list of available domains once you've decided on a domain name click the cart icon to the right to add it to your cart you can add as many domain names as you want then scroll back up and click on the cart icon select yes if you live in the united states or no if you don't if you choose yes enter your zip code and click check out now before you can pay you must first sign up or sign in with your email or connect to your wallet you can pay by credit card so just fill out all your information and then hit submit payment the same is true for paypal where all you need is your paypal email address you can also use either of the various options provided to pay with cryptocurrency make sure to keep the corresponding wallet open so that you can send the corresponding amount of cryptocurrency to the specified wallet address after completing a successful transaction you should be directed to a thank you page where you can view your domains by clicking on my domains at this point you now own the domain but are unable to use its full functionality so to start linking your wallet addresses to your domain selling the domain on openc or building a non-censored website you must mint the domain as an nft on polygon so that wraps it up for what you should know about unstoppable domains you can now send and receive cryptocurrency by simply sharing your domain name so do you own an unstoppable domain too or are you more of an ens fan well let me know in the comments and also of course remember to like subscribe and turn on the notifications for future alpha see ya [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

sXXFz1x9nbI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXXFz1x9nbI,do you remember GameFly launching in 2017 when the cat-centric cryptokitties game nearly brought down the ethereum network due to the overwhelming demand well many other blockchain based games have since emerged including axi Infinity the sandbox and many more today you can subscribe to a slew of blockchain games and potentially earn some money from Trading their nfts or playing the games back in 2021 when axi Infinity was at its height a good team of three axes however would cost around ten thousand dollars up front so unfortunately this means that for the average gamer buying axi nfts to compete in Oxy Infinity is is kind of impossible so this is where crypto gaming guilds come in to help aspiring Gamers play to earn without having to worry about upfront Capital so what exactly are crypto gaming guilds alright let's get into it at their core crypto gaming guilds are Dows that provide in-game Assets in the form of nfts to gamers in exchange Gamers give back a portion of their profits to the guild Lots if not all of gaming guilds also double as VC firms that specialize in supporting game five and nft projects now how do crypto gaming guilds work so their main role is to bring investors Gamers and managers together to organize play to earn games for various blockchains investors or even the guilds themselves will purchase in-game assets such as lands costumes weapons or avatars in the form of nfts for any gamer to rent and use thus removing the entry barrier for all players to access Play to earn games most crypto gaming guilds have a native token that allows staking in their liquidity pool tools and for governance allowing token holders to become involved in decision-making processes as well also the majority of guilds will have sub-dos whose role is to govern specific games in a Guild's portfolio so these sub-dials isolate each game from the main dial while also holding the assets of that game afterwards each sub-dial reports back to the main doubt and returns all of its acquired assets back to the main Dow so this type of organizational structure helps to ensure that sub-dials face minimal risk in the event of a hack and that in contrast the success of each sub-dial leads to the overall gaming guild success so how did crypto gaming guild start so it all started with the game axi Infinity which became popular in the Philippines during the pandemic with the popular hashtag thank you Acts see trending on social media unfortunately competing on axi Infinity was quite costly so as a solution Gabby deason a veteran gamer and axi player saw an opportunity and started leasing his axes in exchange for a cut of the profits he co-founded yield Guild games or ygg which leased axes through axis Scholarships in return ydg would receive 10 of the profits generated by The Gamers or Scholars its Community managers would receive 20 and the scholars would keep 70 percent of the profits the concept worked quite well as more Gamers signed up to play to earn through ygg now axi Infinity is no longer as popular as it once was but just last year it was attracting over 2.8 million players a day allowing both players and guilds alike to enjoy High returns so like I said crypto gaming guilds give all Gamers Financial Independence but it also provides more than just that for example a gaming guild such as Unix is more than a scholarship program for gamers most of their Gamers lacked crypto skills so they created a Learn to Earn program to boost their revenue then also in addition to crypto training English math and cookery classes are also part of the Learners program we also anticipate game five's increased trajectory in Esports where guilds originated Dao's ability to crowdsource and crowdfund new projects is helping gather additional resources and research creating jobs and advancing the metaverse so now that we know what gaming guilds are and how they work let's explore the top 5 crypto gaming Guilds of 2022 so at number one we have yield Guild games as of June 2022 ygg has offered nearly 30 000 scholarships with its portfolio currently at 60 games its native token ygg is backed by ygg's assets which are used for governance and have a market cap of over 100 million ydg sponsors games like League of Kingdoms an MMO strategy game in which players buy build and trade kingdoms through in-game digital assets built as nfts players can earn from in-app purchases when other players interact with their utilities ydg has also invested in Splinter lands a digital card collectible game with each card built as an nft on the hive blockchain here players use these magical cards to help their monsters battle other monsters to win prizes other games supported by the ygd Dao include axi Infinity the sandbox and many more okay then at number two we have Merit Circle another crypto gaming guild to get good Traction in the game five space Merit circles market capitalization is 238 million at the time of recording Merit circle is a dow that functions similar to ygg like with ygg each game has a sub-dial that governs it its native token is called MC with a market cap of 240 million which is even higher than ygds So currently Merit Circle has 3750 players and a total of 50 games in its portfolio it supports games like axi infinity and fight of the ages a MOBA game with an immersive 3D space where each player is their own hero and each player's items such as weapons and Skins are Minted as nfts okay number three Guild five so the guild Phi gaming guild Prides itself on enabling web 3 interoperability by connecting Gamers nft assets and communities across the metaverse it has 3 000 plus players at least 20 games and is governed by the GF token with a market cap of 20 million a standout feature for this gaming guild is the guild fries GF staking program which rewards users with random nft drops and GF rewards based on the amount that they stake guildvice supports a wide range of games including ascenders an open rural Journey Through the strange and exotic world of Ascension in which players must dominate Ascension by crafting resources Minted as nfts it also supports crypto Raiders a Dungeon Crawler for the brave wanting to raid dungeons earn gear and level up plus also axi Infinity Legends of illumia and many other games then at number four we've got Blackpool a dow that is solely dedicated to nft gaming and trading members of Blackpool called troops have a troop lead for each game in blackpool's portfolio The Troop leads screens trains recruits and distributes earnings to troop members blackpool's market cap is currently at 3 million so some popular games under the black hole gaming guild include cometh a web 3 strategy game with 300 plus nft cards for tactical customizing of powerful decks to defeat other players in one-on-one Space Battles and tournaments then also the fast rising Guild of Guardians a mobile RPG for earning tokens and nfts battling amidst deadly dungeons elves Orcs magic and more and then also axi infinity and a lot more okay then to wrap it up at number five we have Unix gaming a dow with over 5 1000 scholarships and 50 plus games governed by Unix Gaming's native token so Unix currently trades at a market cap of 2 million now they have future plans underway including the launch of a Unix app a learn to play program and extra merch with the Unix gaming guilds you will get sponsorships for games like the sandbox which lets you create avatars to take control of in an open world and also star Atlas a space themed futuristic game for players who are fascinated by the stars from space exploration to political dominance to territorial conquests now the gaming industry is continuously growing and by next year the player base is expected to grow to 3.07 billion now although blockchain games in recent days have somewhat lost the popularity they had back in the nft summer many more Mega game projects such as Gino pets aurori alluvium and many more are expected to launch so that's it for crypto gaming guild so do you think crypto gaming guilds will be the next big thing also are you considering a play to earn program well let us know in the comments also remember to like subscribe and turn on the notifications for future Alpha see ya

w5pgnuwJcaU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5pgnuwJcaU,gather around people it's story time this is a story about one of the most headline grabbing splits since the beatles a story about ethereum and ethereum classic why are there two ethereums are they different what's the future of ethereum classic after the merge but first things first let's go back to when it all started the year is 2015 vitalik buterin a canadian programmer creates the first blockchain that supports smart contracts the new network quickly becomes popular for initial coin offerings or icos as different teams used the platform to launch their own tokens one of the most successful icos was the dao which was intended to serve as an investor-directed vc firm the ico was a massive success that raised over 150 million worth of ether but this success was short-lived on the 17th of june 2016 disaster struck hackers exploited a smart contract bug and withdrew a third of the dao's ether over 50 million dollars worth of tokens this was the first nail in the coffin on one side they were investors who proposed reversing the ethereum blockchain to rescue the affected investors while others felt that a fork goes against ethereum's ethos of immutability and decentralization how could you trust ethereum's transactions when they can be reversed that was the big question in the end 97 of the ether holders voted to go ahead with the hard fork and restore the stolen funds as a result the ethereum blockchain split into two separate blockchains the new blockchain network became ethereum using ether as its cryptocurrency the older one which has the original blockchain technology is ethereum classic with etc as its native token from the outside ethereum and ethereum classic may look similar after all they both carry a similar name share the same blockchain technology and use the same consensus mechanism at least for now but how are they different let's start with the difference in their ideologies which led to the contentious hard fork in 2016. ethereum classic stuck to the philosophy code is law the community believed that the blockchain's main attraction is its immutability and no one has the right to censor the execution of code on the etc blockchain to further enhance its code as law philosophy etc relies on independent development groups and individuals to achieve governance objectives ethereum on the other hand is heavily reliant on the ethereum foundation for governance decision making and spearheading the development and direction of the platform the platforms also have different tokenomics models before the split ethereum maintained an unlimited supply policy which it still does to this day ethereum classic however changed this policy after the hard fork and capped the maximum supply to 210.7 million tokens in terms of consensus mechanism as of now both chains use the proof-of-work consensus mechanism but as we already know ethereum is planning to migrate to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism soon want to hear more about ethereum's upgrade watch this video anyway while the two currently use the same consensus mechanism for now they're not equally secure ethereum classic has been a victim of a 51 attack a few times this attack happens when bad actors attempt to obtain control of a cryptocurrency by obtaining 51 percent or more of the power of the network or of the cryptocurrencies of the network ethereum classic was hit with a 51 attack for the first time in 2019 when a bad actor stole almost 500 000 worth of etc at the time and just a year later the same attack happened three times in a row as a result ethereum classic implemented a security change that made a 51 attack 31 times more expensive since then it hasn't suffered any attacks but some investors have lost trust in its security ethereum on the other hand has never suffered from a 51 attack moving on how does ethereum classics ecosystem compare to ethereums in this category ethereum is the clear winner and it's not even close it's outperforming ethereum classic and other platforms in general by a wide margin with over 2 900 dapps running on it while ethereum classic has less than 40. even though ethereum classic is technically the longest running smart contract platform ethereum still has a much stronger ecosystem pull it has more tools and better infrastructure that allow developers to create dapps also the world of decentralized finance also known as defy favors ethereum where popular defy apps like ave and compound use it as their go-to blockchain platform what about the future it's hard to say what the future holds for ethereum classic but as of now the project doesn't drive the same interest as ethereum also it has no plans to transition into a pos chain like ethereum so after the merge the two projects will drift even further apart that said the merge could create an opening for ethereum classic to take some miners and developers away from ethereum considering that post merge it won't be possible to mine ether but it would still be possible to mine etc only time will tell if the potential new wave of miners would drive more interest towards its ecosystem which side of the ethereum rift do you stand on ethereum classic or ethereum let us know in the comments remember to like subscribe and follow us on all our socials for future alpha see ya

Z6R-2hPN_Nc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6R-2hPN_Nc,fuel scroll aztec immutable x and polygon zk evm are just a few of the lesser known layer 2 solutions that have the potential to affect ethereum's future in this video we'll delve into these projects and provide an overview of their basics ethereum is experiencing a scalability crisis with issues such as high gas fees and network congestion resulting in slow and expensive transactions with the striking growth rate of d-apps on ethereum it's paramount that the network finds a scaling solution and fast fortunately layer 2 scaling solutions are paving the way for the future of ethereum these scaling solutions are designed to reduce gas fees while increasing transaction throughput on ethereum until now the crypto community has primarily focused on the big four layer two solutions optimism and arbitram both of which are optimistic roll ups and starknet and zk sync both of which are zk roll ups if you'd like a more in-depth look at optimistic and zk roll ups check out our guide to layer 2's video which goes over the big four layer two solutions and how they work despite the popularity of the big four ethereum's consistent growth over the years has only resulted in increased competition from aspiring innovators all around the world to date there exist many more layer two solutions with an incredibly huge potential to tackle ethereum's scalability crisis while layer two solutions all want to solve ethereum's scalability crisis some may focus on a specific use case a unique design or a new feature different from how other layer 2 networks increase scalability fuel fuel is an optimistic roll-up that unlike most layer 2 solutions uses its own virtual machine known as the fuel virtual machine fuel supports smart contracts fuel distinguishes itself as a network that validates transactions in parallel rather than serially as ethereum and the majority of layer 2 solutions do fuel's use of its own virtual machine and parallel processor allows it to beat both ethereum's and optimistic roll-ups 7-day withdrawal times using atomic swaps in a matter of minutes fuel was launched in december 2020 and has had a slow uptake thus far which may be due to its use of its own virtual machine which poses a challenge to developers who are used to building and running their applications on the ethereum virtual machine regardless fuel's high throughput and distinctive features have the potential to attract more users in the future scroll scroll is a zk roll up that is giving polygon zk evm a run for its money like polygon zk evm scroll uses its own zk evm based execution layer solution zk evm stands for a zero knowledge ethereum virtual machine a zk evm feature allows developers to easily migrate ethereum based d-apps onto scroll without needing to make any changes to the application's code base prior to scrolls zk evm evm incompatibility rendered most zk roll ups application specific posing a challenge for developers looking to migrate d apps from ethereum and integrate them into layer 2 networks the alternative way was for developers to build new infrastructure from the ground up which takes time and resources migrating d-apps from one network to another is now much easier thanks to scrolls innovation scroll is also working on a new update called the pre-alpha test net which they claim will allow users to transact on the network and interact with individual ethereum applications via scroll privacy is gold in the crypto community which aztec capitalizes on through its unique transaction architecture aztec is a zk roll up with a focus on privacy aside from the zk proofs that zk roll ups typically provide the assets transferred between the parties involved with an aztecs ecosystem are kept private aztec connect a private defy that enables smart contracts to be deployed on ethereum from within aztec is at the forefront of aztec's vision through aztec connect users are able to interact with ethereum's smart contracts while retaining aztec's privacy features aztec connect's most popular application the zk.money protocol which provides a privacy shield for ethereum transactions was released in march 2021 through zk.money users can connect to ethereum's defy ecosystem as well as popular l1 protocols such as uniswap lido and ave privately most of the layer 2 solutions we've seen use on-chain solutions to scale however immutable x went a step further by incorporating an off-chain transactional data storage solution which further relieves ethereum of network congestion and high transaction fees while off-chain storage of transactional data may raise trust concerns immutable x appears to foster a strong community particularly in gaming immutable x is used in a number of popular gaming projects including gods unchained and eluvium other industries are also interested including partnerships with disney and turner sports these high-profile collaborations and gaming projects may suggest potential traction and more adoption of immutable x in the coming years polygon an ethereum scaling platform provides a suite of zk roll up solutions the most recent of which is polygon zk evm polygon zk evm is similar to scroll in that it will allow developers to migrate smart contracts from ethereum to polygon zk evm without requiring any code changes thus making it an evm equivalent scaling solution furthermore polygon zk evm will incorporate polygon zero's plonkie 2 prover system which allows for faster processing of zk proofs further reducing polygon zk evms transaction throughput polygon zk evm is scheduled to launch in early 2023 although the launch date is still a ways off polygon has amassed such a large developer and user base that the new polygon zk evm is likely to get off to a good start in closing fuel scroll aztec immutable x and polygon zk evm each provide unique selling points and incentives for using their ethereum scaling solution while fuel scroll and polygon zk evm focused on providing innovative solutions that improve performance and accessibility immutable x and aztec are branching out to capitalize on untapped layer 2 opportunities with distinct value propositions there are many other layer two solutions on the market whether the big four layer twos will continue to take the lead or whether the lesser-known l2 solutions will shake things up a bit remains up for debate and that wraps it up for what you should know about layer two's potential which of the layer twos do you think will take the lead in the coming months we'd love to know what your thoughts are remember to like subscribe and turn on the notifications for future alpha see ya [Music] you,Youtube

2-uu9yrVaDE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-uu9yrVaDE,meet ethereum a superhero known for solving problems in Block City however block city is getting bigger as more people are choosing to build and live there and ethereum is no longer as efficient so enter polygon ethereum sidekick here to help him do the heavy lifting now while polygon doesn't wear a cape like your typical superhero sidekick it has proven to be a much needed solution to ethereum scaling problems so sit back as we break down polygon from its technology ecosystem and protocols to some cool Partnerships that you'd want to know about alright let's get into it okay so let's start by roughly defining polygon and what it tries to achieve so polygon launched as a scaling solution that ran alongside the ethereum blockchain their Flagship product the polygon POS sidechain is used to scale transactions on the ethereum network so think of ethereum as a crowded Highway and polygon as an underground tunnel that helps ethereum's traffic move faster by allowing some cars to pass through it so basically polygon handles ethereum's transactions on a separate ethereum compatible blockchain and returns transactions to the main ethereum blockchain post-processing now this approach lowers the network load on ethereum significantly and in doing so polygon can speed up transactions and also lower transaction costs so for some context on ethereum's scalability issues its gas fees have shut up to over 190 dollars the average roughly forty dollars now this is usually driven by the relatively limited number of transactions that can be facilitated using a single block miners in such a scenario choose the highest price transactions as their priority so the results is an increase in effective gas prices now in direct response with ethereum's problems polygon provides an easy framework for new and existing blockchain projects to build on ethereum without scalability issues now it is important to note that polygon has grown into a more complex platform that allows developers to build and launch fully interpolable blockchains in fact presently one of the goals of polygon is to make ethereum an internet of blockchains similar to ecosystems like Cosmos and polka dot alright so then let's get a little bit more Technical and find out how polygon generally works so let's go back to our Highway analogy where we mentioned that polygon decongests ethereum by providing an underground passage for cars but this is not the only solution right we could also build overhead roads for example now similarly polygon uses a variety of L2 solutions to create a speedy parallel blockchain and Link it to the main blockchain some of these Solutions include the plasma chain which provides a framework for building dapps off chain benefiting from ethereum's secure infrastructure and zero knowledge Roll-Ups based on zero knowledge proof meaning that it executes the transactions off chain only submitting the proof of validity to the main ethereum chain now it is named roll ups as it basically rolls up transactions into batches that are executed off Chain by the way you can click right here to watch our video on xero knowledge proof now there are other scaling Solutions and more are continuing to be developed as polygon is trying to prepare ethereum for Mass adoption by boosting its transaction throughput all without sacrificing the network security and user experience okay so then let's zoom in a little bit further and focus on polygon's Main side chain their proof of stake chain that runs parallel to ethereum now the chain has its own set of validators we do the heavy lifting by staking their Matic tokens and verifying transactions to secure the network in exchange for receiving a cut of fees which is also in the form of Matic delegate can also stake their Matic indirectly via a trusted validator to get a share of the rewards this chain is also ethereum virtual machine compatible allowing ethereum-based apps to migrate their smart contracts to the polygon Network now this also allows the transactions to happen on polygon sidechain where users will be paying fees in Matic which will be a fraction of what they would have paid on the main chain polygon would then need to update ethereum on what happened off Chain by posting the transaction data back to the main chain all right so let's look at some of the biggest D5 projects already on the network so polygon has seen widespread adoption from users and developers alike according to defy llama it hosts around 268 protocols totaling a tvl of over 1.7 billion some of these Pro protocols include Ave one of the most popular lending platforms and decentralized exchanges like quick swap which use the scaling solution to offer users faster and cheaper trading while the most popular projects on polygon are the traditional dapps polygon provides scaling solutions to other spaces like blockchain gaming by helping developers and Gamers build and play games more effectively top gaming and nft dapps like avegachi and sandbox have scaled their user experiences with polygon its timing in the gaming industry is perfect as the fast growing nft industry has been integrated into blockchain gaming basically Gamers can buy sell and trade different types of in-game assets as nfts now polygon has not only been excelling from a technology point of view but also from a business point of view one of the biggest polygon Partnerships is with Disney the media and entertainment company chose the scaling solution as one of six companies to be a part of its program to develop AR nft and AI experiences now polygon has also partnered with social media Giants Reddit and meta the latter was announced in May when Meadow was testing a new feature on Instagram that allows creators to share nfts on their feed by directly connecting their account to a web 3 wallet shortly after Reddit announced a partnership with polygon for their new nft Avatar Marketplace that allows users to purchase nft pfps now this feature does not need a crypto wallet instead users can purchase the nfts Via credit or debit cards the nfts are minted on polygon and can be stored on reddit's own crypto wallet Vault okay so then what does the future look like like for polygon well this is a question that has been asked a lot in light of ethereum's upgrade so one of the co-founders of polygon Sundeep nail wall addresses these comments in an interview with coin Telegraph stating that he believes ethereums switch to a proof-of-stake network will not change much in the way of transactions per second some deep notes that the ethereum upgrade might succeed in increasing throughput which will still be low and that wouldn't change that much even when shouting finally happens in three to five years as more ethereum native D5 Protocols are starting to migrate to polygon plus the Network's committed goal of developing additional scaling infrastructure the extent to which polygon can help scale the ethereum network remains to be seen now all in all as a project it is definitely one of the most interesting ones to watch in the future so what do you think is Paul polygon one of the projects on your watch list will let us know in the comments and of course also remember to like subscribe and follow us on all our socials for future

j3Bwqis07FQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Bwqis07FQ,ready for a quick trivia Mary a BTC Enthusiast has been investing ten dollars on the first day of every week from January 2017 to August 2022. what do you think her portfolio looks like now according to crypto head's calculator Mary has made a cumulative return of 11 732 from her two thousand nine hundred twenty dollar investment this strategy employed by Mary is known as dollar cost averaging or DCA in this video we will find out how the strategy Works how it compares to attempting to time the market and its potential drawbacks but first things first what is dollar cost averaging from the example we've just covered with Mary we can determine one important thing about the strategy it involves breaking down and spreading out Investments instead of Mary investing two thousand nine hundred twenty dollars all at once in BTC in 2017 she decided to invest ten dollars in the digital assets every week the idea behind this method is that by Mary purchasing smaller amounts over a period of time as opposed to in one go she is more likely to average out with a better return and reduce the impact of Market volatility dollar cost averaging has its benefits over attempting to time the market first it provides investors with an opportunity of getting the best average price for instance since Mary consistently buys Bitcoin weekly there are times that its value Falls and times it rises shall therefore get the best prices worse prices and everything in between of course Mary's gains may seem significantly less compared to an investor who bought the dip around the same time for instance what if another investor Bob invested the same amount Mary did in five years at once on January 1st 2017 one BTC went for around one thousand dollars and at the time of making this video it goes for around twenty three thousand dollars so Bob's two thousand nine hundred twenty dollar investment could have grown to around sixty seven thousand dollars which is over five times Mary's accumulated amount this only happened because Bob's timing was perfect however this is very difficult to achieve even for experts thinking of timing let's check out dca's other benefit this strategy May alleviate the fear of missing out or fomo it's human nature for anyone to have the fear of being left out that is why more people tend to buy during bull markets however fomo makes us act on emotions instead of executing a planned out strategy it's a double-edged sword though as the same emotions tend to play out when investors decide to panic sell their assets once prices plummet since they don't have a particular plan in place DCA however may help investors to remain disciplined as it usually involves them sticking to and fully executing their plans regardless of prices and Market sentiment that said DCA has its drawbacks the most notable one being that investors may end up missing out on massive gains for instance if Mary like Bob had chosen to go all in at once instead of spreading out her principal her portfolio could have grown to sixty seven thousand dollars compared to eleven thousand dollars using the DCA strategy no like we've mentioned big profits require timing the market correctly and even professional investors can't necessarily predict movements of the market so DCA is a potentially safer way to take advantage of big Market dips another drawback of DCA though not as significant is to do with the fees investors incur on trading platforms as this strategy involves regularly buying the asset the cost due to trading will be more though DCA is a long-term strategy so ideally fees should potentially become small relative to your potential gains over one two or five years and Beyond keep in mind that DCA is also used in selling except that you will be pressing the sell button regularly DCA is a lower risk and lower reward Strat strategy but may offer the chance of benefiting from Market swings that said remember that there is never a sure way of investing especially in the wild crypto market so despite the fact that you invest in a relatively Safe Way with dollar cost averaging you still have no guarantee of a positive return also investors are different in terms of financial goals and how much risk they can stomach so everyone might have different opinions on different strategies well let us know your opinion on dollar cost averaging in the comments below remember to like subscribe and follow us on all our socials for future Alpha see ya [Music],Youtube video,Is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Investing Strategy the BEST?,2022-09-05 00:00:00,315.0,CoinGecko
eq9c46dqhn4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq9c46dqhn4,in the crypto Community many alternative layer 1 chains are often referred to as the ethereum killers with cardano being no exception but what makes cardano unique how does cardano differ from ethereum both are smart contract platforms that enable users to build decentralized applications on their networks the key difference however lies in how the two platforms go about implementing their functions well let's cover all of this in this video where we will look at five key differences between cardano and ethereum all right let's get into it foreign let's start with the consensus mechanism while the current version of ethereum uses the proof of work consensus mechanism which is also used by Bitcoin cardano uses proof of stake a proof of work consensus mechanism Works through thousands of computers constantly performing vast amounts of trial and error computations all over the world to validate transactions however the more people use ethereum the higher the number of transactions to verify resulting in the first scalability issue slower transaction speeds then as a result users are forced to pay high gas fees for their transactions to verify faster than all other transactions waiting in line now also as the network grows and more miners join the network more electricity is required to perform mining computation stations resulting in yet another scalability issue which is high energy consumption slower transaction speeds high gas fees and high energy consumption all pose an impending scalability crisis which cardano seeks to solve with its proof of State consensus mechanism so cardano is the first blockchain to introduce an academic and peer-reviewed proof of State consensus mechanism that is more secure than proof of work and will be highly scalable in the future a proof of stake mechanism involves a group of cryptocurrency owners who are in charge of validating Network transactions now this group is chosen based on the number of cryptocurrencies they stake over a specified time period once a validator is chosen they will have the opportunity to receive a reward in the form of the Network's native token in exchange for their efforts at securing the blockchain now cardano's proof of State consensus mechanism handles more transactions per second it consumes less energy and can scale more easily compared to ethereum's proof of work which are among the reasons why ethereum plans to transition to a proof of stake model in the upcoming merge upgrade which is estimated to be implemented by the end of 2022. so both cardano and ethereum have similar features in terms of functionality and applications ethereum has its own native cryptocurrency called ether which you use to perform transactions on the network cardano on the other hand uses its native token Ada to perform transactions both cardano and ethereum allow the creation of decentralized applications through smart contracts so then as I said earlier cardano has much faster transaction speeds than ethereum cardano can process approximately 250 transactions per second this is a lot more than ethereums 12 to 15 transactions per second with its Hydra scaling solution cardano could process up to 1 million transactions per second in the near future on the other hand ethereum is looking at 100 000 transactions per second after the completion of a series of plant upgrades for the network okay then let's talk about the DAP ecosystem so a metric which we can use to evaluate the popularity of a blockchain is its dap ecosystem which comprises wallets D5 nfts gaming and lots more so let's compare the ethereum and cardano ecosystems let's start with ethereum so ethereum being the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts is said to have a first mover advantage and the largest Network effects so it has the largest developer base and the most dapps built on top of it so as a result ethereum is currently the market leader in terms of decentralized applications daily exchange volume and application utilization when compared to other networks okay so then on the other hand we have cardano which Falls far behind ethereum even though cardano offers greater scalability and launched pretty shortly after ethereum it wasn't until September 2021 that its smart contract functionalities went live so cardano's dap ecosystem appears to be in its early stages for example let's compare D5 applications on Toronto versus ethereum as they're typically the first decentralized apps to spring up to form the backbone of any ecosystem so although not exhausted defy llama lists 501 defy dapps on ethereum while only 12 on cardano so kind of giving us a sense of the difference in size between the two ecosystems and this is not even looking at the number of nft collections Dows or other applications within the two ecosystems as well now noticeably however cardano has prioritized Financial inclusion in developing countries with several alliances with African governments to facilitate access to defy services including collaborations with Tanzania and the European Business University of Luxembourg to support African students now that said many new layer 1 chains have sprung up over the past year or so which have taken up some of ethereum's market share so only time will tell if cardano becomes another blockchain to do so okay so then let's take a look at scalability so in terms of scalability cardano outperforms the current version of ethereum the platform reduces gas costs conserves energy and has faster transaction times however ethereum has had a notable Head Start in the smart contract craze which has helped the network achieve a larger market cap and become the leader in the dapps market space currently layer twos and side chains are also mushrooming in order to deal with its scalability issues its future upgrades will also make it able to compete better in terms of scalability and Energy Efficiency so for cardano to be a significant Contender it has a lot of catching up to do well that wraps it up for what you should know about cardano versus ethereum so which blockchain do you think will dominate The dapps Market in the future well I'd love to know so leave it in the comments below also remember to like subscribe and turn on the notifications for future Alpha see ya

VXlI-uzhBX4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXlI-uzhBX4,you've probably heard of ave the largest decentralized finance defy project on the market today but do you know what ave is and how it works don't worry you don't need to be a tech expert to understand it so sit back and relax while we break it all down for you what exactly is ave ave is an open source decentralized finance protocol that allows people to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies through non-custodial liquidity markets because ave operates on blockchain networks there is no centralized authority governing the network instead ave operates and governs the network through a decentralized autonomous organization or dao made up of people who own and vote with ave tokens ave is also unique in that it allows borrowers to get loans without having to provide any personal information such as name address or social security number in fact ave is a finnish word that means ghost hence the ave ghost logo which alludes to the anonymity of ave transactions so how is ave born ethereum's smart contracts introduce new unimaginable blockchain capabilities ranging from blockchain powered games to nfts to decentralized finance defy and much more ave began as ethlend which was founded by stani kulachav in 2017 as a peer-to-peer p2p decentralized lending protocol that connected borrowers to lenders via the ethereum blockchain the ethlend protocol launched through an initial coin offering ico that raised over 16.2 million dollars in exchange for over one billion ave tokens then called lend however a peer-to-peer p2p model proved inefficient this resulted in the rebranding of ethlend to ave in early 2020. in the rebrand ave implements a new model that is similar to a peer to lending pool to peer p2p model owners of lend tokens had the option to exchange them for new ave tokens at a 100 to 1 ratio with the introduction of the new ave tokens you could have a say in the direction of the ave network over time ave even expanded from the ethereum network to other markets such as polygon phantom harmony and avalanche how does ave work ave works through lending pools in which lenders deposit tokens into a lending pool containing the same type of cryptocurrency so ethe owners will deposit into an eth lending pool while usdc owners will deposit into a usdc lending pool and so on just like bank deposits lenders or depositors here they will be able to earn interest the same goes for borrowers who can also borrow various assets at the cost of interest the rate of lending or borrowing is usually reflected in an annualized figure called the annual percentage yield or annual percentage rate when lenders deposit funds into a lending pool the interest they earn accumulates in the form of a tokens the letter a standing for ave a tokens are interest-bearing tokens native to the ave protocol that are minted and burned upon the deposit and withdrawal of assets from lending pools each a token is pegged to the value of the corresponding cryptocurrency in the lending pool so if you deposit funds into an eth lending pool you will receive a eth in return which will increase an amount as it passively accrues interest in your wallet to borrow cryptocurrency one must deposit tokens that are worth more than the amount you'd like to borrow this is known as over collateralization once done borrowers can borrow up to a certain percentage of their collateral's value in dollars the percentage is known as the collateral ratio which is predetermined by the protocol or dow riskier assets usually have a higher collateral ratio currently there are over 30 ethereum based assets you can borrow on ave borrowers must pay back the amount borrowed plus interest the interest rate is determined by the supply and demand for the amount of cryptocurrency available in the lending pool according to ave there is no set time limit for repaying a loan so it's up to you when you want to pay off the loan whether or not you'll get liquidated depends on your borrow utilization if it exceeds the collateral ratio which can be due to a fall in your collateral value and appreciation of your borrowed assets against your collateral or even accrued interest you can be liquidated so pay attention to these numbers all of these procedures are supported by smart contracts which enable all ave transactions to be executed automatically when preset conditions are met features of ave now that we've seen what ave is and how it works let's look at some of ave's features lending and pooled liquidity the most notable feature of ave is its lending and pooled liquidity model ave employs a peer-to-peer p2p model in which lenders deposit as many tokens as they want into a liquidity pool containing the same type of cryptocurrency borrowers then borrow funds from their chosen liquidity pool for which they pay a variable interest rate for the duration of the loan the interest earned is then divided among the lenders based on their respective contributions to the loan flash loans another feature that ave possesses is flash loans ave's flash loans feature specially contributes to the project's popularity in the d5 market space these are uncollateralized loans of any amount that borrowers can obtain through the protocol the main caveat is that a flash loan must be paid back within the same transaction block from which it was borrowed because flash loans occur over a short period of time they are not recorded in a user's account balance if you don't pay back before the transaction block is added to the blockchain the flash loan will simply fail to go through to take out flash loans in a single transaction you must have a strong understanding of smart contracts its applications range from collateral swaps to arbitrages to yield farming for profit native tokenization the third feature we are going to look at is native tokenization ave has a native token called ave most of its use cases apply solely to the ave protocol such as voting rights trading fee discounts collateral discounts higher loan amounts and fee-free loans ave is known as a deflationary token because almost 80 percent of the ave fees earned from the platform's transactions are burned this way the token supply is constantly decreasing which could help increase the token value of the circulating supply the ave token is currently trading at 98 per 1 ave with a market capitalization of 1 billion dollars and a circulating supply of 13 million tokens v3 features the most up-to-date ave protocol is version 3 which adds new features and capabilities to the protocol so far three feature updates that stand out the most include portals the term portals refers to cross-chain transactions the portal feature aims to allow ave tokens to be transferred from one blockchain to another next up is high efficiency mode e-mode the e-mode allows increased capital efficiency ave's goal is to increase the protocol's efficiency by enabling higher borrowing power ave v3 will allow borrowing of up to 98 of the collateral you provide as long as the collateral token is the same as the tokens you'd like to borrow isolation mode the third feature in ave's version 3 is isolation mode the isolation mode feature will allow ave to add new tokens to their protocol while minimizing the risk posed to other tokens on the network ideally isolation will mean that borrowers are restricted from borrowing other tokens on the protocol if the collateral they deposit is of the newly added token type there are many more feature updates we can expect from ave v3 such as gas optimization and layer 2 designs so keep an eye on twitter and ave.com to stay up to date the future of ave ave and the defy ecosystem in general have a long way to go for a long time the traditional finance sector has been at the forefront of lending financial assets for profit however it is clear that cryptocurrency is catching up with more and more people signing up to d5 projects every day additionally ave has consistently improved its services to provide the most efficient lending protocol for its users ave intends to launch its own over-collateralized stablecoin gho in july 2022 with a one-to-one value pegged to the dollar moreover there's also an affiliated game called ave gachi which incorporates ave's a tokens into its core gameplay mechanics turning those little ghost nfts into interest-bearing financial nfts stani kulachav ave's founder has also grown his interest in launching the lens protocol a polygon-based decentralized social networking platform this new protocol will allow users to buy and sell their creative content as nfts it's tough to predict whether ave will continue to increase in value in the coming years as ave competes with other high performing d5 projects such as compound we can only advise you to always do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose and that wraps it

NOjST7ny4oY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOjST7ny4oY,let's run a small social experiment real quick to set the stage for tokenomics later alright so we have two friends Bonnie and Rick now Bonnie here knows a thing or two about crypto and holds some assets while Rick doesn't really pay much attention to the space we show both of them ethereum's coin page on coin gecko how do you think each of them will interpret the information on the page since Rick doesn't really know much about crypto the coins price will probably be the only thing that will grab his attention and make sense to him right on the other hand Bonnie May pay more attention to other details like the market cap circulating Supply maximum Supply Etc basically in doing so Bonnie is sort of assessing ethereum's tokenomics so in this video we will find out what tokonomics is and what it entails but before that we have a special announcement of a brand new feature on our platform so we have introduced a tokenomics tab that analyzes token allocation Supply schedule vesting and mechanics that will not only help you in your crypto research but also save you a lot of time so do not miss out make sure to check out the new feature on our website alright let's get to it what is tokenomics so the term is used to capture a tokens economics building a crypto project can be analogized to building a car from the ground up and tokenomics is one of the most important parts of the car now if you only look at the price of a token so say a brand of a car you're not really getting a whole lot right you know oh it's a nice car but you also want to look at how the car will move how efficiently it will do so and how far it will go so tokenomics of a token includes but is not limited to its functionality objective allocation policy and Emissions schedule so let's check out some of the key elements of a tokens tokenomics starting with the token Supply so unlike physical Goods Supply in crypto is not as straightforward earlier in the video when we were checking out ethereum's coin page you may have noticed three types of Market supplies displayed that is the total Supply circulating Supply and maximum Supply so the circulating Supply is the number of publicly issued tokens in circulation currently there are over 120 million ethereum coins in circulation this is an indicator that ether is actively being mined the total Supply on the other hand also includes any tokens that have been created and then burned so burning in crypto is used to describe the act of permanently removing tokens from circulation making the remaining tokens in circulation becoming more scarce lastly the maximum Supply is the maximum number of tokens that can ever be generated however not all projects have this for instance ethereum has no maximum limit although its issuance each year is capped Bitcoins to economics on the other hand dictates that no more than 21 million coins can ever be mined we have also seen nft projects taking scarcity to the extreme projects like the board API Club only have 10 000 nfts in their collection while some projects might mean only a single nft for a piece of art another key metric of a token's tokenomics is market capitalization commonly known as the market cap it describes the sum of total funds invested in the project and is calculated by multiplying the current market price of the token by the circulating Supply this is one of the common ways of ranking coins by size and popularity since coins with higher market caps are seen as more popular oftentimes sophisticated investors will make use of the circulating Supply and market cap data to estimate and project the token's value especially when combined with other parameters such as vesting schedule a token with high market cap but low circulating supply for instance can be subject to high selling pressure in the future especially when there are aggressive vesting schedules lined up on the other end of the market cap spectrum is the fully diluted market cap which is a measure of the the market cap when all the coins are issued it is calculated by multiplying the sum of the maximum supply of a coin by the coin's current price fully diluted valuation is another metric that investors use to measure a Project's value when you see the term valuation in an article about raises for a crypto project it refers to fdv now we recently added a fully diluted valuation toggle and coin comparison page to allow you to seamlessly compare market cap and fully diluted valuation between different cryptocurrencies another variable that affects tokenomics is the allocation and distribution of tokens during the initial launch stages of a project the executive team or the community will decide how tokens are allocated or distributed generally there are four main categories of initial asset allocation the first allocation category is the public sale which is open to anyone who wants to participate then Community allocations are ecosystem funding that goes back to the community the third allocation category involves insiders these are the people who have a vested interest in the success of the company in return they receive a lot of the company's share then fourth other tokens may be allocated to foundations Grand pools and other awards that are given out to the people who participated in the community token allocation and distribution are essential in assessing a Project's economic for example if a Project's token are primarily owned by its Founders they will have significant control over the Project's governance and could make decisions that are not in the best interest of the network as a whole this could lead to stagnation or even worse a complete collapse of the project closely related to the allocation metric is vesting this refers to the process of locking and releasing tokens after a particular period sometimes if too many tokens are circulated in a short period of time and releases are made too often the chances of its value depreciating is high usually vesa tokens are offered to advisors partners team members and other key members to align common interests and long-term commitment to the project next up we have one of the most important aspects of a token it's utility use cases for tokens can vary for instance governance tokens allow the holder to vote on changes to a tokens protocol stable coins on the other hand are designed to be used as a currency while security tokens may represent different Financial assets on the blockchain so in other words what problems does the token solve to thumb up since Bitcoin was created in 2009 tokenomics has evolved significantly but overall most projects with solid tokenomics models have stood the test of time while some with poor tokenomics designs have faltered that said it's important to note that no single Factor provides a magical key to a Project's success it's always a good idea to combine tokenomics analysis with other tools when assessing a project so let us know in the comments about other tokenomic metrics that you consider before investing in a project and of course

nCf4nzn60nc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCf4nzn60nc,hello passengers may we have your attention please your flight to the everything you need to know about the ethereum upgrade island is about to take off we ask that at this time to please fasten your seat belt thank you and enjoy your flight all right so we think that it will be best to break down the ethereum upgrade from a bird's eye view so that you can see the whole picture now we should mention right off the bat that the upgrade is not a one-time thing instead it has been planned in phases so what stage of the upgrade are we in now what changes do we expect to see and as an ethereum user what should you do on your end well let's find out okay so before we go any further let's quickly cover ethereum and its design that way we can understand why the upgrades are necessary so to do this let's go way back in time to 2015 and meet ethereum's founder freda lake buterin the canadian programmer introduced ethereum that year as the first blockchain network to feature smart contracts which are basically algorithms that self-execute once specific preset conditions are met therefore cutting out intermediaries now unlike the bitcoin network which was and still is purely transactional vitalik envisioned ethereum as a world computer one upon which decentralized applications would live and this vision became a reality and more and more dapps were built on the network at a staggering pace but ethereum started suffering from its own success with scalability issues as it can only process around 15 transactions per second now this is nowhere near enough for context the network processes trillions in transactions annually and has around 38 billion in total value locked according to dfa llama so you sort of see the issue clearer now right so with the network being limited to 15 transactions per second transaction times and fees end up rising at times of network congestion so enter ethereum upgrades now as we've mentioned the upgrades are not happening all at once it's not as straightforward as going to the app store and clicking update or replacing one part with the other rather the upgrade will take place in phases now also to avoid confusion the ethereum foundation deliberately stopped referring to the upgrade as ethereum 2.0 earlier this year stating that they intend to reflect the fact that what's happening is a network upgrade rather than the launch of a new network so anyway let's go deeper into the main three phases of the upgrade so the first upgrade known as the beacon chain went live in december 2020 and this upgrade introduced native staking to the ethereum blockchain a key feature of the network shift to a pos consensus mechanism now keep in mind that ethereum is traditionally a proof of work network where miners use a machine's processing power to compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles and verify new transactions which is an energy intensive process on the other hand pos networks instead rely on your staked assets to secure the network and validate transactions specifically the amount you staked acts as a form of guarantee that you won't try to compromise the very same networks that your funds live on now the main advantage of pos is that it is far more energy efficient than pow as you don't need a lot of computing power to secure the blockchain now note that the beacon chain is a separate blockchain and has been running in tandem with the ethereum main net you can learn more about pow versus pos in our video right here okay so then the second stage known as the merge represents the joining of the existing execution layer of ethereum that is the main net we use today with its new proof of stake consensus layer the beacon chain after the merge happens that is when the two systems finally come together proof of work will be replaced permanently by proof of stake now this phase is in its final stage with the merge expected to happen in the third or fourth quarter of this year you can check out the ethereum foundation's blog for the latest progress updates okay so then on to the final stage of the upgrade which is known as sharding which involves splitting the database on the ethereum blockchain so that instead of settling all operations on one single blockchain shard chains spread these operations across 64 new chains so this way each validator verifies only the respective shards they're responsible for instead of verifying the whole network therefore sharding encourages decentralization by lowering the barrier to entry for anyone wishing to run a node this is also when ethereum's scalability and capacity are improved now currently scaling solutions like layer 2 roll-up scaling solutions are already being implemented and are meant to work synergistically with sharding in the future this technology takes much of the burden of computation and storage out of the main blockchain and uses the chain just enough to benefit from its security guarantees according to the ethereum foundation this stage is expected to be implemented sometime in 2023 okay so now what after the upgrade upon the upgrades completion ethereum will experience all of the proof of stake benefits pos will bring ethereum better scalability accessibility and security as well as make it more environmentally friendly that said the cause of ethereum's issues was scalability in the first place ethereum's upgrade aims to address the trilemma a term coined by vitalik himself which implies that you cannot have scalability security and decentralization all at the same time for example increasing scalability and decentralization means cutting into the security as you have to do more validation more quickly hence security will suffer according to vitalik it is the job of the ethereum upgrade to make the network scalable while still sustaining its security and decentralization attributes though to make things clear especially since the next phase will be happening soon the merge will not lower transaction costs nor is it expected to meaningfully increase the speed of these transactions okay so then what do you need to do for the ethereum merge is there anything that you need to do well this question has come up due to some ethereum users having concerns about their funds but ethereum has specified that no action is required to upgrade on your part so you don't need to do anything with your funds or wallet before the merge when completed the potential of decentralized technology may be truly realized so on a scale of one ethereum to 10 ethereum how excited are you about the upgrade well let us know in the comments also remember to like subscribe and follow us on all our socials for future alpha see ya [Music] you,Youtube

iJwTXE9PaVE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJwTXE9PaVE,get your catwalk on today we'll be hitting the runways virtual runways in this video we will look into fashion nfts how do fashion and nfts correlate who are the most prominent players and what does the future look like sit back and let's get this show on the road the nft industry started as a tiny snowball a couple of years ago and as the years go by the snowball has been getting bigger and bigger so much so that many other industries have been roped into it one of these industries is fashion where brands have found a new breed of customers to cater to for years the two industries ran parallel to each other but their paths crossed as soon as they realized how blockchain technology could offer unique solutions to some of the fashion industry's biggest problems for instance counterfeiting pretty sure you have come across your fair share of fake jordans nikes or even dior the fashion industry can't seem to rid itself of these pesky fakes according to red points the global counterfeiting industry is expected to hit the 4.2 trillion dollar mark this year blockchain technology and nfts are giving fashion brands new ways to fight counterfeiters by allowing users to check for the authenticity of products in 2021 a blockchain consortium called aura was launched signing up leading labels such as prada and louis vuitton to allow consumers to access product history and proof of authenticity of luxury goods the paths of nfts and fashion also cross through gaming fashion nfts and gaming have always been a perfect match since fashion was more or less an integral part of gaming even prior to nfts gamers would grind for hours or spend some cash to unlock wearables but only within the game itself nfts allow the tokenization of these digital items which can potentially be integrated into other metaverses or games or even be sold for profit that said the nft fashion industry is still up and coming but its growth has been accelerated with big brands stepping into the scene let's check out some of the brands that have been making waves in the space starting with the first major luxury fashion house to get into nfts gucci gucci's first official nft wasn't your typical wearable launch instead it came in the form of a four minute short film created to celebrate gucci's 100th year anniversary and included an upcoming collaboration with balenciaga the nft was sold at christie's auction for 25 000 usd you can't go wrong with sneakers even virtual ones at least this is true for rtfkt a virtual sneakers brand that launched in 2019 in early 2021 rtfkt studios partnered with a young and rising crypto artist going by ferocious to produce a series of sneakers he designed three virtual sneakers and interested parties had the option to try them on on snapchat before entering an auction to bid the winners were able to redeem a physical real-life pair of the sneakers over 600 pairs were sold in just seven minutes for a total of over 3.1 million usd rtfkt was already up and rising but it's acquisition by sports fashion giant nike late last year took it to the next level launching the brand and nfts into the global spotlight in april 2021 overpriced and nft based fashion brand sold the first wearable hoodie that is linked to an nft the hoodie is splashed with a scannable code that links anyone who scans it to the nft's entire history that is current owner previous owners and its worth in case the hoodie is stolen or damaged a new hoodie with a brand new code is shipped to the buyer and the previous code is invalidated two months later in august 2021 louis vuitton launched an nft project in the form of a mobile game known as louie the game as part of the 200th birthday celebration of the brand's founder the game had players make their way through animated worlds while collecting candles along the way to a birthday celebration it had a total of 30 nfts embedded in the player's journey 10 of those nfts were created in collaboration with beeple a digital artist popular with nfts that sold for around 69.3 million usd the nfts in the game however are only collectibles and cannot be sold fast forward to 2022 gucci made its comeback into the nft world with super gucci nfts in collaboration with super plastic the project kicked off earlier this year with 10 unique nfts each accompanied by a handmade italian ceramic sculpture designed by both gucci and super plastic the nfts are now trading on open c and some of them have fetched over 30 eth prada also hopped right into the mix as just earlier this year they unveiled a new monthly time capsule collection drop limited edition physical products that also came with nft gifts while we have sampled just a few examples of the biggest nft fashion trends it is clear that the industry is quickly evolving and brands are trying to come up with creative new ways to cater to their audiences in general nfts have been a great addition to the fashion industry allowing creators to digitize their items and tap into a bigger customer base globally it also allows consumers to easily trace back the items and prove a product's authenticity also since big brands are catering to a new audience that has been very receptive virtual fashion shows in the metaverse have become a reality as a space that is only in its early stages it'll be exciting to watch new innovations that will pop up to benefit both brands and consumers any fashion nft enthusiasts watching the video let us know in the comments remember to

1FCgveUruzk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FCgveUruzk,the cryptocurrency markets have been in a state of regulatory limbo for some time now and various government agencies have been experimenting with different ways to regulate the industry but so far there has been no clear consensus on the best way to do so so that begs the question will regulating crypto bring more good or more harm well let's answer this and other questions in today's video about crypto regulation and what's going on in the crypto world all right let's get into it okay so what is crypto regulation so crypto regulation is the legal framework that lays out the rules governing the selling and buying of cryptocurrencies on cryptocurrency networks so these laws may include tax requirements a crypto company registration requirements stricter requirements for stable coins and more like this so then why is it happening well cryptocurrencies have been long regarded as a wild frontier with no set of rules or regulatory framework governing the network so why are regulations being imposed now well the most compelling reason people are calling for a regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies is the recent hacks scams and fraudulent activities impeding cryptocurrency networks elliptic a security form estimates that more than one billion has been lost as a result of just five major hacks in 2022 almost ever every other month a new hack leads to some users losing as much as their life savings other concerns about the crypto Market include its high volatility which makes a large number of users and businesses hesitant and wary in making crypto Investments the recent news about Lunas collapse in the whole 3ac Voyager and Celsius debacle only made matters worse now despite multiple efforts to develop technology that will prevent hackers and the loss of millions of dollars in investor funds it's becoming clear that it may be time to consider stringent security measures we've seen some major hacks recover stolen funds with the assistance of law enforcement such as the recent seizure of 3.6 billion from a massive 4.5 billion cryptocurrency hack so then there's also the issue of mass adoption users and businesses believe cryptocurrency investment is too risky a regulatory framework May encourage increased adoption as people may feel safer investing their money in cryptocurrency if users fall victim to scams or hacks they will have more confidence in recovering lost funds with the government's backing a regulatory framework may also encourage more companies to innovate if they feel more secure investing time and resources into the crypto industry however cryptocurrency is fundamentally based on the Network's decentralization and pseudonymous transaction features which begs the question of whether cryptocurrency regulation will cause more harm rather than good okay so then let's take a bit of a deeper look at the pros and the cons so let's talk about the pros well first people argue that crypto regulation will protect long-term investors when the high volatility of the crypto Market is regulated long-term investors may feel safer investing their money in to currency this could take the form of government imposing stringent regulations on the cryptocurrency market however the specifics of how this will work are still unknown okay so then another Pro which we kind of already talked about is that it says that it will prevent fraudulent activities one of cryptocurrency's biggest challenges is hacks and scams that result in millions of dollars in stolen funds now a regulatory framework may help prevent fraudulent activities from occurring one of the proposed Frameworks includes tracking Network transactions larger than a certain amount of money however this would require cryptocurrency networks from all over the world to implement the protocol because the network itself is decentralized it could also mean that the government will only allow verified networks to launch thus preventing rug pools then another Pro is that it could also promote Innovation so some companies feel that allocating resource sources to the crypto industry is a risky move so a regulatory framework may increase confidence allowing more companies to participate and eventually innovate in the crypto economy okay so then of course there's also cons so let's take a look at some of the cons so on the other hand a sizable number of people believe that crypto regulation will do more harm than good by disrupting the core tenets of cryptocurrencies some argue that crypto regulation will impose control over the network preserving Fiat currency's dominance in financial markets others are concerned that crypto regulation will undermine the transparency and pseudonymity of cryptocurrency transactions which are the Network's unique value propositions then there's also the main argument that cryptocurrency is a decentralized financial system that should operate independently of central authorities there's also been heavy debate about certain D5 protocols being registered as security exchanges which may not be in the best interest of the current users subscribed to this platform and then one of the biggest appeals of crypto is how it lowers the barrier of entry for access to financial services and products but regulating the network May revert us back to traditional financial markets and their challenges okay so then what is the current state of crypto so most of the initiatives for crypto regulations are now coming from the US so in 2021 there was a lot more scrutiny on the asset class and today in 2022 there has been more traction as Regulators have previously stalled primarily due to the difficulty of regulating cryptocurrency the Federal Reserve set the ball rolling in January 22 with its proposal for a government-issued actual currency on June 3rd 2022 New York legislators passed legislation prohibiting specific cases of crypto mining using carbon-based fuels reportedly to adhere to admission Targets on June 7 2022 Senators proposed the responsible Financial Innovation act to exempt stable coins from taxes for small-scale payments of less than two hundred dollars on June 8 2022 another rule was passed requiring stable coin issuers to have clear Redemption and the full backing of their coins okay so that's the us but what about outside of the US well currently there are no internationally coordinated crypto regulations but right now nine countries prohibit the use of cryptocurrency the most notable of which being China's blanket ban in May 2021 meanwhile 42 other countries restrict or prohibit financial institutions from dealing with cryptocurrency currency exchanges on the flip side however El Salvador passed a Bitcoin law in June 2021 allowing the use of cryptocurrency as legal Tinder the law however did not accomplish much because most businesses never used Bitcoin in their transactions okay so then over to India where the government levied a 30 tax on cryptocurrency the United Kingdom on the other hand has prohibited the largest cryptocurrency exchange binance from operating in its country since June 28 2021 while other countries like Japan have been more welcoming legalizing stable coins as digital money linked to the Yen or another legal tender and these are just a few examples of the regulations that have been imposed now moving forward it's unclear what the course of crypto regulation will be clearer rules are still being developed as the crypto Community continues to weigh in on the best course of action action whatever people's opinions are though it's clear that crypto regulation is a matter of when it's coming and not if for now though cryptocurrency remains a highly unregulated decentralized transparent and pseudonymous network that will take a lot more effort to assert complete control over so that wraps it up for what you should know about crypto regulation so what do you think is crypto regulation a good thing or a bad thing well we'd love to know what your thoughts are so leave them in the comments below also remember to

tvW9VKJ58Lg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvW9VKJ58Lg,when you hear the word blockchain what instantly comes to mind there's a chance that you're picturing a fully transparent distributed ledger the key word here is transparent thanks to this feature data on the blockchain is available on chain for everyone to see at any time and from anywhere in the world why is this important for starters it makes on-chain analysis possible in this video we will introduce the concept of on-chain analysis and how crypto investors and traders use it to make smarter financial decisions make sure you watch the whole video to find out some of the most useful on-chain tools in the market but before we go any further let's zoom out on the whole concept of crypto analysis it's important to understand that on-chain analysis is just one of the ways in which cryptocurrencies are analyzed the other two ways are technical and fundamental analysis the latter takes a deep dive into all the information available about a coin with the aim of determining its intrinsic price ideally investors get to compare the fundamental value to the current market value of the coin to see whether the coin is undervalued or overvalued the technical analysis on the other hand is common among traders since it involves looking at past price movements in an attempt to determine which way the market is likely to move next at its core technical analysis is used to find buy and sell signals all right now that you have the overview of crypto analysis in general let's now focus on on-chain analysis just by looking at the name we can tell that this type of analysis is unique to cryptocurrencies unlike the other two since it involves blockchain technology basically on-chain analysis gives us public access to the real-time health of a financial system the information extracted say transaction data and crypto wallet balances are used to determine market sentiment and eventually used to make investment decisions say a new token just launched but you're still undecided whether to invest information gathered from on-chain analysis can help you make this decision okay let's assume that you find out that the token isn't actively traded or maybe a large percentage of its circulating supply is held by a handful of whales these aspects might influence your decision right however the use of on-chain analysis goes further than just making initial investment decisions it can also be used to measure the strength of a network evaluate a cryptocurrency's price see who's buying and selling or even in criminal investigations let's take a closer look at some of them starting with using on-chain analysis to measure the strength of a network on-chain analysis metrics may be used by traders and investors to provide an overview of the network in some way it answers questions such as is the network growing are people using the network some of these metrics may include active addresses while they do not necessarily show the number of people using the network they show the number of addresses being used by individuals exchanges or even minors simply put the more active addresses on a network the better since it's an indicator that more people are using the cryptocurrency or at least buying it up speaking of buying let's move on to the second metric transactional volume which represents the dollar amount of a cryptocurrency exchange between addresses most traders consider a cryptocurrency's trading volume to be one of the most important predictors of its future trajectory and performance in the cryptocurrency market also while all cryptocurrencies are volatile large volume coins and assets tend to be less volatile the third metric that can give us a good idea of the health of a network is the supply distribution we've briefly touched on this when we described a network that has a handful of whales may not be the best representation of a healthy network whales are basically individuals or institutions that hold a large number of coins the supply distribution shows the percentage of coins held in addresses categorized by size it's an important metric since whales tend to affect the market regardless of whether they are holding or trading if you think about it if they decide to hold their coins it creates scarcity right on the other hand if they are actively trading they would create volatility in the market the fourth metric used to assess the health of a network is the total value lot or tvl this term is used in d5 to describe the total value of cryptocurrency locked or stored in a d5 application or a smart contract therefore the tvl can be used to gauge the protocol's popularity liquidity and trust among investors for instance looking at this data from difiloma we can tell that ethereum is the most popular chain by just looking at the tvl and similarly maker dow is the most popular protocol by tvl all right those were some of the many metrics that helped to get a sense of the general strength of a network let's now look into how investors and traders use on-chain analysis to see who's buying and selling while the on-chain metrics we've just covered might represent a way to assess the long-term health of the network the ones we will cover here are more reflective of the short to midterm market action for example if we saw a large number of coins move on to exchanges we can conclude that maybe lots of long-term individual investors have made some profit and so they are preparing to sell this may also indicate that the market may correct itself in the near future due to these actions some of the indicators in this category include realized profits and losses which measure the dollar value of bitcoins that are being sold at either a profit or loss for example if bitcoin was purchased at twenty thousand dollars and sold at thirty thousand dollars it will be counted as a ten thousand dollar profit another metric closely related to this is the supply in profits and loss it shows the number of coins currently in profit or loss compared to their last purchase price generally a healthy market will have more coins in profit than in loss great the third metric in this category is the realized capitalization we already know about the market cap what about the realized cap it is a way of evaluating cryptocurrencies by adding together the most recent purchase price of every token say bitcoin in supply this result is then compared to the market cap and if the realized cap is greater than the market cap then the overall market is sitting in profit there are still so many ways traders and investors use on-chain analysis what we have covered here is meant to give you the basics of this type of analysis by the way there are many tools and platforms that offer insightful charts and dashboards to better help users visualize the blockchain data that we have been talking about each of them may be suited for different needs so let's take a look at some of them the first tool that we'll look at is glassnode it's a popular tool that offers all kinds of on-chain metrics to mainly do with bitcoin investors like to keep an eye on bitcoin's on-chain activity due to its significance and influence in the crypto market its price movements often cause a domino effect throughout the rest of the market anyway on-chain metrics available on glassnode include active addresses sending addresses new addresses blocks mined and realized cap to name a few some of the metrics are free to registered users while others require a subscription these on-chain platforms cover more than just specific coins though we have ones like dune analytics that provide data on specific d5 and nft projects it's additionally a free platform that is run by contributors to get started you can input any defy or nft keyword in the search tab for instance if we input top nft collections and press search we'll get a bunch of results and get to choose the one that best fits our needs now we have an in-depth look at these nft collections through the charts offered and the different metrics provided here there are several other helpful tools like manson which tracks where money from institutions and large investors is flowing in and out from nansen's home page you may get to see hot defy contracts or hot tokens to give you an idea of what other investors are doing in d5 they also have nft paradise which showcases the hottest collections that are being minted or bought by smart money allowing you to potentially catch the wave for these early on that said on-chain analysis has its own drawbacks with the biggest one being the limited back history of data mainly since like blockchain technology on-chain analysis is still emerging and evolving to accommodate new trends that may require the creation of new metrics generally on-chain analysis shows great promise but remember that it's not the only tool available the best traders and investors use a combination of techniques including fundamental and technical analysis to make financial decisions do you use any of the three methods of analysis to make your investment decisions let us in on some of your methods in the comments section remember to like subscribe and follow us on all our socials for future alpha see ya

5YBkujGj-DI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YBkujGj-DI,hey there how much are you willing to pay for a three digit domain name maybe 16 or maybe even 160 or 160 000 no well an unidentified collector recently paid over one hundred and sixty thousand dollars for the five five five dot eth domain name now ens domain names have been fueling the latest nft craze and people are buying selling and even forming exclusive clubs around them also by the way if you still don't get the concept of ens domain names we suggest that you watch our video covering the basics first anyway let's take a look at the most popular ens nft so make sure that you watch the whole video to find out the emoji domain name that sold for over 22 thousand dollars we will sample some of the most popular ens nfts categorized by ens vision a handy tool that tracks ens domain names now note that these categories are ranked according to 24 hour volume at the time of making this video alright let's get started all right to kick us off let's check out the english verbs category so this category consists of randomly minted verbs with varying lengths but like most ens domain names shorter words have the potential of fetching higher prices as you can see art.eth last sold for around 30 ethereum same as gas.ethe the most expensive verb domain name to date though is trade.eth which was sold for around 50 ethereum all right next let's check out the three letter first name category as expected popular names are fetching crazy amounts for instance gym.eth was last sold for 25 ethereum for minion fans gru.eth is going for about 3.5 ethereum right now however sam.eth takes the cake in this category last purchase for 100 ethereum okay next up we have the 100k club which consists of domain names of the first 100 000 digits so from zero zero zero zero zero to nine nine nine nine nine after investors and collectors went crazy over four digit domain names the 100k club was formed now some us residents were quick to match their five-digit domain names to their postal code which also has five digits the most expensive domain in this category is 8888.eth which was last sold for around 6.88 ethereum this domain name also belongs to the five-digit palindrome collection which basically contains five digit numbers that read the same forward or backward then another category that has been fetching crazy amounts is the pre-punk club most names in this category were minted before 2017 they are domain names that were minted before the crypto punks collection there are about 55 000 minted domain names in this category with the most expensive one being paradigm.eth and is fetching around a whopping 420 ethereum in its last sale then it's also not just english words or numbers that have been popping off the arabic 999 club which contains arabic numerals from 000 to 999 has also been getting a lot of attention the arabic numeral zero zero zero is the most expensive domain name in this category and went for around 100 ethereum in its last purchase then who said that your domain name has to be words or numbers next up we have the single emoji category with over 1 000 emojis in this category several of them have been sold for over a thousand dollars the most expensive single emoji the polar bear was last sold for 3.45 ethereum and then there's also the triple emoji category which instead of one emoji per domain name is three the highest sale made in this category is the dollar sign domain name which fetched over 15 ethereum or 22 000 okay then last but definitely not least is the collection that triggered the ens nft hype so bns was launched in may 2017 but it wasn't until 2022 that really caught on one of the catalysts was the 10k club so on april 26 2022 users began frantically buying numbered ens domains from zero zero zero zero to 9999 without any centralized coordination so a twitter account and a private discord server exclusive to holders was then created at the time of writing the 10k club domain names lead in both the 24 hour traded volume and the total traded volume 88888.eth features as the most expensive domain name in the collection last sold for 38 ethereum so then you might be wondering why are ens suddenly so popular well apart from fomo it's clear that users are noticing the value of holding in ens domain using it not only as a form of digital identity but also as a status symbol and this has led to the decentralized domain service earning over 52 million revenue this year according to dune analytics so like web 2 domains related to big brand names are very expensive so naturally domain squatting is a thing in ens so this is where someone buys a domain to block other people from buying it with the goal of reselling it for profit so for example recently the domain amazon.eth was offered 1 million usdc by an unidentified wallet address on openc the bid was however ignored by the owner despite the last sale of the domain name being a couple of months prior for 33 ether or 48 642 at the time of making this video now i don't know maybe the owner was hoping to get more than 1 million dollars who knows now the same goes for domains belonging to subgroups like the 10k club due to their scarcity and exclusiveness they tend to fetch higher prices now all in all it seems that ens names are not only popular for now but they're here to stay so do you own an ens domain name well let us know in the comments and of course also remember to like subscribe and follow us on all our socials for future alpha see ya [Music] you,Youtube video,Top 6

8WJ4T5LbHKQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WJ4T5LbHKQ,how cool would it be if you woke up to free crypto in your wallet aside from the more well-known air drops there is another token distribution strategy known as lock drops that can allow you to obtain free cryptocurrency so stick around to learn more about what lock drops are how they work examples of popular lock drops and much more [Music] new projects usually bootstrap their initial phases through one of three ways initial coin offering or ico airdrops and most recently lock drops an ico involves the raising of funds for a new project however drops and lock drops do not instead they distribute free tokens to users in slightly different ways in this video we'll look at what lock drops are how they differ from air drops how they work the main features of lock drops examples of popular lock drops and the future of lock drops let's get started so what is a lock drop a lock drop is a type of token distribution method used by cryptocurrency projects to entice project participation they require users to lock a certain amount of cryptocurrency within a smart contract for a set period of time in return for the project's own token the caveat is that users won't be able to use the locked cryptocurrency until the specified time period expires you may be wondering if users get free tokens in the end why not just use airdrops instead to answer this let's compare lock drops to airdrops in the cryptocurrency community airdrops are a more traditional way to distribute tokens historically airdrops are distributed to users who have performed certain tasks these can be as simple as signing up for newsletters sharing a project on your social media pages becoming one of its early users and more in the past airdrops have struggled to develop an active user base with longevity in other cases users may just decide to sell the tokens and move on to more exciting projects as a result lockdrop was developed as an alternative solution that can better align the long-term interests of protocol and users so here is how lock drops work as mentioned a lock drop requires users to lock away a certain amount of assets for a set period of time in exchange for the protocol's own native tokens the more tokens you put away and the longer you choose to lock up the more free tokens you'll receive once the waiting period is over in this way protocols are able to distribute their newly minted tokens to a user base that has shown commitment to the success of their project the lock drop also ensures a certain amount of value is locked within the protocol which is often a key indicator of protocol usage and traction on the other hand investing in a new project through a lock drop allows you to become an early stakeholder all for the cost of accessing liquidity what are the main features of lock drops now that we know what a lock drop is let's explore the main features of distinguishing lock drops when looking for lock drop opportunities here are the main features to consider lock drops require the staking of cryptocurrency in a smart contract for a set period of time at the end of the waiting period token holders receive back their stake as well as free tokens companies use the lock drop method of token distribution to identify a target group that demonstrates a reliable show of commitment to the project's success lock drops unlike ieos idos and icos do not allow protocols to raise funds funds that new projects might be in dire need of examples of popular lock drops commonwealth labs a government focused company was the first to introduce the lock drop concept in the summer of 2019 for edgeware a new smart contract platform based on the polkadot blockchain to participate in the edgeware lockdrop users were required to stake their eth tokens in an ethereum smart contract for three to 12 months users were then given their locked eth tokens as well as edgeware's newly minted edge tokens for free to use on the newly launched edgeware protocol lock dropped 201.2 edge per each to ethereum token holders in a fair launch model more than 90 of the edgeware token edge was distributed to ethereum token holders while 10 percent of the total edge supply was allocated to the edgeware team other examples of projects that use the lock drop method are tara's mars protocol and astroport what is the future of lock drops in the cryptocurrency community lock drops are still a relatively new concept edgware's lock drop was the most successful attracting billions of dollars in investments for the project so it's fair to assume that more companies will use lock drops to incentivize active usage on their platforms nonetheless cryptocurrency is a highly experimental field so we anticipate more lock drop distribution methods in the future in closing lock drops are a potentially cost effective way to invest in a new project they're also a way to get involved in a project at its early stages as a validator thanks to being an early stakeholder not to mention the tokens you acquire are free as long as you're willing to sacrifice a bit of liquidity all in all lock drops are an up-and-coming cryptocurrency opportunity that you should check out and that wraps it up for what you should know about lock drops what do you think about investing in lock drops we'd love to know

xrKrQp_Tvt4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrKrQp_Tvt4,today we will be taking a deeper swim in the nft's waters we will find out what the nft world has to offer beyond popular pfps and avatars like board apes and crypto punks stay tuned to find out the top 10 types of nfts and there are some interesting entries too so make sure to watch the whole video all right let's get into it [Music] all right the first and most popular type of nft which you've probably heard about is art the concept of non-fungible tokens changed the game when it came to proof of ownership this is why many artists were quick to capitalize on the opportunity for some this is paying off as people are paying a lot of money to own virtual artworks including pictures videos and gifts just to name a few now we cannot talk about nft art without mentioning one of the pioneers art blocks an nfd creation platform where artists can sell on-demand generative art except that the buyers typically don't know how the artwork will look before buying it in 2021 art blocks blew past 100 million in sales volume and at the end of the year one of the nfts was sold for 945 ethereum or 2.8 million dollars at the time this happened a couple of months after mike beeple winkelmann's famous piece every day's the first 5000 days sold for a whopping 69.3 million then at number two we have music nfts now similar to its effect on art nfts introduced a new way of monetizing music by removing intermediaries and connecting musicians directly to their fans now that's it music nfts have also made headlines in late 2021 the music legend whitney houston's one of one nft a never before heard demo track from houston at age 17 sold for 999 99999 now as time goes by more popular artists are embracing the idea of monetizing their work through nfts one example is musician snoop dogg who is active in the music nft scene okay then the next one is an interesting one meme nfts yep people have paid thousands of dollars even millions for meme nfts now i'm pretty sure that you're familiar with the doge mean the simple picture of a shiba inu named kibosu was taken back in 2010 and later became an internet sensation fast forward to june 2021 the doge meme sold for a record-breaking 4 million worth of ethereum that's pretty crazy if you think about it the owner pleaser dao a decentralized art collection platform fractionalize the nft to allow more individuals to hold a piece of the meme now you want to know how nft fractionalization works click right here okay then the fourth type is gaming nfts unlike the types that we've discussed gaming nfts do not necessarily involve the creators selling the whole game as an nft instead in-game assets such as characters or skins or other items are the products so this allows the possibility of game assets to be transferred out of and between games this alone gives the assets value outside the game sort of rewarding gamers for their time and money nft games such as steppen has hundreds of thousands of in-game assets listed on openc okay then next up we have fashion nfts now these nfts are virtual so the owners can't wear them physically instead they are used to dress up online avatars in the metaverse so last year gucci the italian fashion label gave its fans a unique chance to purchase nfts that explore the past present and future of their 100 year history other international brands such as louis vuitton have also dropped collections and other nft projects it was recently randomly awarding users with free nfts through its game app okay then at number six we have access nfts an up-and-coming use case of nfts now as the name implies access nfts gives holders access to specific communities experiences and items in either the metaverse or in reality nft ticketing for virtual or live events is one of the most popular use cases of access nfts basically an event is set up and those who want to attend would need to mint an nft ticket earlier this year a physical event the build space africa conference used this method to give attendees access to their event large projects like bayc allow holders to enjoy exclusive perks including access to events in fact last year these nfcs were used as passes for the first ever irl bayc meetup okay then at number seven we have redeemable nfts which allow tokens to be redeemable for a physical good this mechanism can be applied to a variety of offline goods so for example sellers of valuable physical items can create a token representing them to be showcased and traded digitally this enhances the user experience by removing intermediaries so uniswap was the pioneer of this model when it allowed users to redeem tokens for a physical pair of socks to incentivize holders to burn their tokens instead of holding on to them uniswap gave the holders an nft for redeeming their tokens then next up we have domain nfts a unique type of nft that is represented by a single non-fungible token this token functions as a crypto address and website domain by leveraging the blockchain they offer unique advantages to traditional domains for one domain nfts are 100 user owned therefore free from control by centralized entities also unlike traditional domains which require annual renewable fees they are purchased only one time domain nfts can be bought and sold like any other nft crypto domain providers include companies such as ethereum name service and unstoppable domains the niche has been gaining momentum recently with people paying a lot of money for domain names okay then at number nine we have sports nfts a new revenue stream for sports leagues and fans some popular projects in the space include nba top shot an nft marketplace that allows fans to buy sell and trade basketball video clips just like conventional sports training cards the rarer the clip the higher the potential price so that lebron dunk or iconic steph curry three-pointer might fetch a higher price in the market other sports like ufc and nfl are using the same concept okay then finally at number 10 we have collectibles cryptokitties which launched in 2017 as an online collectible project on ethereum is one of the first instances of people using nfts since then bigger projects that have taken the nft world by storm like bayc have emerged now they are typically released in collections that include thousands of unique avatars the rarity of which is determined by their traits people have paid crazy amounts of money up to three million dollars for these nfts on top of that celebrities like eminem serena williams and justin bieber just to name a few own or have owned ward apes before making them even more popular now while our list has an exhaustively covered all the types of nfts these are some of the most popular ones now that said the nft industry is still growing and there's still a lot more to be discovered from meme nfts to domain nfts that may revolutionize digital identity in web 3. it seems we are only scratching the surface so that's it what do you think which type of nft will have the biggest impact on our day-to-day lives in the future well let us know in the comments i'd

tqwzTumNRHY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqwzTumNRHY,cryptocurrency is a Hot Topic right now which means that users are getting a lot of new information every day and you might be shocked to learn that some of the things that you think are true are actually missed so if you're curious about crypto but you don't want to be taken for a ride by scammers and snake oil salesmen well then stay tuned because we're going to set the record straight by debunking seven of the most prevalent cryptocurrency misconceptions since we're sure that there are a few things about cryptocurrencies that you may be wrong about alright let's get started the first myth which we're sure that you've heard before is that cryptocurrency will make you rich well as you've probably seen with cryptocurrency markets only a few investors take out big returns these lucky investors are often the ones who receive the most attention with news outlets printing flashy headlines about a random investor becoming a billionaire overnight but before you're swept over to the hype make sure that you do plenty of research about the million other investors who took a chance on cryptocurrency you'll likely find some people who did indeed get lucky returns but you also find plenty more who made huge losses trading in crypto the overall concept to keep in mind is that cryptocurrency is very volatile prices can change overnight for better or worse so before investing all always make sure you're investing not more than you can afford to lose keeping in mind that things can go either way another myth tying in closely with getting rich in cryptocurrency is that there is a way to predict trading profits true there are trading patterns that seem to work well in favor of price predictor applications out there like when a popular celebrity tweets that cardano is the next revolutionary cryptocurrency or a popular cryptocurrency exchange powering ethereum happens to file for bankruptcy in the former cardano prices May Spike up and in the latter ethereums may drop but it still remains impossible to predict exactly how much the price will change and also for how long there simply just is no logical way to predict trading profits and anyone advising you on which cryptocurrency to invest in is probably relying on speculation rather than actual facts okay let's shift gears a little bit to the energy consumption side of things you've likely seen Rising concerns from conservation programs and influencers worldwide about cryptocurrencies high amounts of energy use capable of powering many countries now while there's no denying the high amounts of energy cryptocurrency uses there is a flaw in how concerning the energy cryptocurrency uses actually is take for example electrical energy powering all the home and Industrial appliances we use in a single home there are likely many appliances that run on electricity plus there are several measures in place for using renewable energy Minds continually being implemented worldwide China for instance banned all domestic crypto mining following reports of China hosting the largest second mines most of which heavily relied on coal Tesla also dropped Bitcoin as a payment option when environmental concerns spiked up according to a study by Cambridge University 75 percent of miners use some renewable energy making up 39 of the total energy used so when you compare the benefits virtual currency presents to the energy used we're close to 40 percent of it is renewable it's fair to say that cryptocurrency being the main perpetrator of high fossil fuel use and thus global warming is a myth another popular myth is that cryptocurrency encourages criminal activity it's easy to deduce that Anonymous transactions help get away with illegal activity but there is much more to cryptocurrency that might actually reduce criminal activity if statistics of crypto related crimes are to go by cryptocurrency May potentially reduce Financial crime when compared to fiat currency as the industry only reported 0.62 percent in 2022 and 0.15 in 2021. Fiat is reportedly used by criminals to launder money 800 time more frequently than cryptocurrency the reason for the high disparity is mainly because every cryptocurrency transaction is permanent unchangeable and publicly accessible to anyone at any time so while physical cash is in essence untraceable cryptographers can always Trace suspicious transactions to its source in a blockchain some hackers have millions sitting in an account simply because moving even a single token risks exposing their locations to the authorities a case in point is the colonial pipeline hack where authorities recovered Ransom payments paid to the hackers through cash flow analysis and other techniques okay so this brings us to two other myths that closely relate to one another the first one cryptocurrency is private it's widely believed that cryptocurrency is enough Anonymous but it's not very private the information that holds the most value when dealing with money is never what your name is or where you live rather it's how much money you have in your account and your transaction Behavior over time all your transactions are visible to anyone on the blockchain through your public key so there really isn't a way to make transactions privately on the blockchain now the other myth that ties in closely with making private transactions is that your cryptocurrency Investments are safe now not to scare you or anything but as long as anyone on the blockchain can see how much money you have and you're transacting on the internet hackers will unfortunately always look for a security vulnerabilities to exploit we've seen this happen in a number of high profile hacks where users lost their cryptocurrency Investments due to a million dollar worth hacking attack some popular blockchains like Bitcoin that maintain High Standard Security protocols have never been hacked however the marketplaces and exchanges where people interact with these cryptocurrencies are vulnerable so always stay on high alert while investing in crypto now you can watch this video of the top biggest crypto hacks to know some of the most expensive hacks in the cryptocurrency industry in history okay finally let's finish with a popular myth that you've probably heard before crypto currency is a Ponzi scheme now admittedly there are quite a few similarities between cryptocurrency Investments and Ponzi schemes where the first few investors seem to make the most profit but also note that there is never a constant climb in cryptocurrencies that would suggest a Ponzi scheme if anything users seem to make losses or gains within a highly volatile space and also cryptocurrencies have real world value that has a higher likelihood to replace fiat currency than the other way around well that wraps it up for what you should know about the biggest cryptocurrency myths are there more cryptocurrency myths that you've heard of before oh we'd love to know what your thoughts are also of course remember to like subscribe and turn on the notifications for future Alpha see you in the next video [Music],Youtube video,Things You're Wrong About Crypto,2022-08-04 00:00:00,531.0,CoinGecko
ViopbzAsYJg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViopbzAsYJg,cryptocurrency is gaining more and more popularity recently this means that there is an even greater risk of falling victim to scams on the market and one of the most prevalent forms of scams are rug pools keep watching this video to learn more about what rug pools are how they happen rug pool scams to look out for and tips on how to avoid them let's get started imagine having someone yank a rug out from under you without warning they drag it out forcing you to lose balance along with anything you had on you when it comes to the cryptocurrency world rug pools happen in a similar fashion perhaps you've heard about a new project in town with exponential growth rates the coin's value is skyrocketing from zero to as much as 10 times return on investment in a matter of minutes naturally more people will join the bandwagon in an effort to make some quick cash let's say you decide to give your cryptocurrency investment one more night of growth before withdrawing your large sums of profit so you go to bed as happy as a kite only to discover the next morning that the value of your coin has dropped shockingly to zero the team behind the token sold all their shares dragging the token's price to the ground and the chances of the token prices ever popping up again are pretty slim if any of these instances sound familiar then you've probably fallen victim to a crypto scam called a rug pool how do rug pools happen a rug pool happens when the developers of a hot crypto project suddenly withdraw all of the investors funds and make a run for it since there is no liquidity left to back up the cryptocurrency's value the market price drops significantly often to zero leaving investors with no way of trading their coins and getting their money back rug pools often occur in the world of crypto which allow anyone to create and list new tokens without having them verified as legitimate a popular rug pool is the squid game token rug pool the developers of this project took advantage of the popular squid game netflix show to build market hype around their new squid game token the token will function similarly to the show with players earning squid tokens when they play the squid game the catch was that people would need to invest a certain amount of squid tokens to participate the token's hype grew to soaring heights it amassed a massive social media following and its price skyrocketed from a few cents to nearly three thousand dollars however due to the mechanics built around the token no one could withdraw their money which is a classic case of a honeypot the developers withdrew all of the investors funds crashing the tokens price to almost zero dollars in just about five minutes investors were unable to sell their tokens and even if they could the coin's market value was next to nothing the developers and walked away with an estimated 3.4 million dollars of investors funds what's even more shocking is that 24 hours after the price dipped to zero the coins price shot up by 28 with a trading volume of over 1.2 million dollars which means some investors continue to buy the token how can you tell that a project is a scam let's have a look at the top three scams to watch out for unfortunately cryptocurrency is hardly regulated so it's entirely up to you to stay vigilant to avoid falling victim to any of the scammers out there at the top spot is unlocked liquidity since scammers often rug pull investors funds through withdrawing from the cryptocurrency's liquidity pool you may want to make sure that the project you're investing in has locked liquidity locked liquidity means that the developers of the project cannot withdraw funds from the liquidity pool for a certain period of time it may be locked for a few weeks or a few months some projects lock the liquidity for longer periods of up to 500 years if the liquidity is locked for a longer period of time you can have some satisfaction knowing that there are lower chances of a rug pull next you may want to check whether a few wallets hold an overwhelmingly large amount of the project's total tokens many rug pools have irregular token distribution these wallets are often called whales and they pose the greatest risk to a rug pool if they decide to sell all their tokens all at once thanks to the crypto scene being transparent you can see what wallets hold what to confirm the token distribution of a crypto project go to etherscan which is a popular platform that shows which wallets hold the largest amounts of the total token supply tools such as unicrypt to check if the project has liquidity locked with them remember to also pay attention to the duration of the lock up liquidity locked for a measly one month for instance is as good as being unlocked most crypto projects will take months to years of development on the other hand mosting up new projects pretty fast sometimes launching overnight consequently it's easy to spot a fake crypto project by the publicly available information about the project which brings us to the third red flag to watch out for lack of audits the crypto community constantly performs audits independently that help to verify a project's authenticity in case a crypto project lacks a third party security or financial transparency audit there's a high likelihood the project may be a scam where the contract may allow developers to mint an unlimited amount of tokens or where only certain addresses are able to sell their tokens run now that we've seen three of the most popular scams to watch out for let's look at tips on how to avoid falling victim to rug pools 1. always perform due diligence on a project before investing take advantage of what the crypto community says about the project as well as checking out the project's source code the white paper and the links within the project's website and their social media pages [Music] there are also great online rug pool checker tools you could use to detect rug pool or honeypot crypto projects including bsc scan token sniffer honeypot detector bs checker rug doctor and cryptac two be careful of the fomo effect if you ever feel like you should invest in the cryptocurrency simply because of the fear of missing out don't let it not be the main reason for making a cryptocurrency investment without first performing proper due diligence on the project three watch out for suspiciously growing market prices cryptocurrencies are highly volatile still some tokens can have suspiciously striking growth rates without any valid reason for it when a token spikes up in value and you have no valid way of justifying its growth then you may want to hold off on making that investment four check out the project's social media presence social media is the most notorious driver of rug pools so you may want to keep an eye out for suspicious social media behavior for starters you can check out the project's social media pages for any suspicious follower accounts likes or comments also most rug pools spin up their projects overnight so they spend less time perfecting their websites if a project's website has a fishy overall design faulty links or lacks uniqueness there are high chances the project is fake 5. don't dismiss the red flags we put this tip here because even with the red flags a 10 times return on investment can really tempt you to invest in a project in other instances everyone around you may encourage you to invest in the project despite feeling unsure about it it's crucial to keep in mind that some rug pools can take months or years before they happen during this time it's best to always trust in yourself and know when to walk away rug pools are a crypto scam that take advantage of market demand the popular fomo fear of missing out effect often causes more people to hype up a specific cryptocurrency leading to even more people wanting to invest in what seems to be the next big project on the market unfortunately not all crypto projects are legitimate as some developers choose to gamble with investors funds so it's always crucial to stay vigilant before investing in any project and always make sure to never invest more than you can afford to lose always remember rule number one do your own research and that wraps it up for what you should know

wDPy-SIwHOU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDPy-SIwHOU,did you know that mistyping wallet addresses is one of the most common ways of losing crypto that said we can all agree that long wallet addresses are a bit annoying and confusing there's an ethereum based project known as ethereum name service that tries to combat this problem by allowing users to display long ethereum public addresses in a simplified text form ens provides the same service for web 3 as the domain name service or dns does for web 2. instead of typing 104.18.4.127 to visit the coin gecko website you can simply type coingecko.com similarly in ens the long tedious combination of letters and numbers can be simplified to say coingecko.eth which is easier to memorize use and share that said these two services differ significantly especially since the ens leverages the capabilities of the ethereum blockchain unlike the dns ens is decentralized making it resistant to censorship and overall more secure so how does the ens work similar to how dns has top level domains like dot com or dot org ens also operates on a system of dot separated hierarchical names called domains the top level domains such as dot test and eth are controlled and owned by smart contracts known as registers which specify the rules and regulations that govern the distribution of subdomains therefore for us to create coingeco.eth we would have to interact with the dot eth register afterward we will then have total control over the sub-domains this means we have the freedom to say pay.coingecko.eth or email.coingeco.eth the domain names use the erc 721 standard to represent a unique address this is the same standard that represents ownership of nfts hence making domain names tradable all of these are possible due to two main components of the ens working in the background the registry and resolver the former maintains a list of all domains and subdomains while the resolver handles the translations from names to addresses or other types of resources and vice versa so how can you get your own ens domain first you'll need to head over to apps.ens.domains after which you'll be prompted to connect your wallet choose any of the available wallets after connecting your wallet type in the domain name you are interested in and click search to check its availability you'll notice that most of the popular names are not available this is because they were auctioned off in ens early days though if you find that your desired domain is available click on it here you can choose your registration period and also see an estimate of the fees when you are ready to proceed click on request to register at the bottom right of your screen this will bring up your wallet hit the confirm button to approve the transaction you'll need to stay on the page as your domain name is processed when processing is done you can click on register at the bottom right of the screen congratulations your ens is now registered you'll still need to set a resolver and bind your old address to your new ens name to do this under resolver click set and select use public resolver then click save to bind your old address to your ens name under records click the drop-down menu select address paste your address in the field and click save once this is processed you can now receive crypto through your new ens name the most obvious advantage of ens domain names is the user friendliness they come with they're not only less confusing unlike the long string addresses but are also easy to remember this reduces the chance of errors also ens does not suffer from security issues faced by a dns system since ens records are secured by the ethereum blockchain and so they cannot be destroyed dns however is not decentralized like ens since it stores records of domains and names on a centralized server it is prone to hacks according to coindesk in october 2020 google's threat analysis group monitored a record-breaking 180 000 attacks on dnss as well as on other network targets that were launched from chinese internet service providers ens has its own governance tokens and dow by the way you can click here to watch our video where we break down the concept of dowse holders of the ens token can submit proposals and cast votes to determine the direction the protocol goes in the future note that ens is just one of the domain name service providers available there are several other competitors including unstoppable domains they are both built on ethereum and both help to achieve similar purposes however there are some big differences philosophy-wise for one ens is an open and public protocol developed by a non-profit that is heavily focused on decentralization and community decision making unstoppable domains on the other hand operates as a for-profit company this comes with its own drawbacks as there have been cases of the company preventing some domain names to be owned by users even if they are not in use and if you didn't already know there's even an exclusive group known as the 10k club for ens name holders from 0 to 9999 in fact there are a lot more exclusive ens clubs but we'll cover that in another video you wouldn't want to miss it so stay tuned all in all ens is making a positive impact in the crypto ecosystem by helping to make interaction with the blockchain easier and as its popularity continues to increase it is sure to be one of the important components of web3 do you think that ens will replace dns in the future let us know in the comments

e_Im2g2xsAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_Im2g2xsAg,hey there imagine this you have a top secret code that opens a mysterious door in a cave you're willing to sell the code to your friend jerry however you want to prove to jerry that you have the code without revealing it in any way well wait a minute is that even possible well what if we told you that it is through a method used in cryptography known as zero knowledge proof it is a way of doing authentication to prove that something is known without revealing directly the known information all right let's get into it so this concept was developed by a group of mathematicians in the 1980s and has been used by various cryptocurrencies such as zcash which unlike public blockchains like bitcoin gives you the option of confidential transactions and financial privacy through shielded addresses so that seems interesting right well then let's get back to our mysterious cave and see how this whole concept of zero knowledge works all right note that since you have the code and you're trying to prove that you do you are known as the prover jerry on the other hand is trying to verify that you indeed have the code and so he is known as the verifier now things get interesting here because in the cave you find that there are two different entrances with paths that are connected with a door this provides the perfect environment for you to prove to jerry that you have the code without revealing it to him jerry goes to the entrance of the cave but has to wait outside to give you instructions let's name the entrances a and b you enter at random through one of the entrances while jerry waits outside to tell you which path to exit through if you really had the code you would be able to exit through the path that jerry wants every single time by using the door but mathematically you would have a 50 chance of picking the right entrance and path from the get-go the best thing is to run the test again and again to reduce any chances of luck involved now from this example you're able to use the same proofs to verify that you have the code by opening the door and coming out through jerry's requested path multiple times in this sense your proof system aims to achieve statistical soundness completeness and most importantly zero knowledge these are the three main criteria that a zero knowledge proof method must satisfy so first soundness so soundness in that if the information provided by the prover is false then a zkp method must allow the verifier to refute that the prover is telling the truth if jerry asked you to come out through path b but you came out through path a multiple times or even just once it could mean that you don't actually have the secret code to the door then the second criterion is statistical completeness which implies that if the information provided by the prover is true then a zero knowledge proved method must enable the verifier to verify that the prover is telling the truth simply put everything that is true has proof in our illustration this would mean that as long as you come out through the path that jerry indicates every time then it's very highly likely that you have the code now the third criterion to be met is zero knowledge such that the method must reveal to the verifier nothing else than whether the prover is telling the truth or not in our case the only information revealed is that you were able to go through one entrance and leave from the other because you have the secret code in no instance did you reveal to jerry the secret code by the way the example that we've just covered is an interactive zero knowledge prove method where the prover and the verifier interact several times until the verifier is convinced the other type is known as a non-interactive zero knowledge proof where proof can be delivered offline without direct communication to the verifier now regardless of the method zero knowledge proof in general has its advantages and its disadvantages so advantages include simplicity since it does not require complex encryption methods zkp also reinforces systems security and privacy the zero knowledge proof method strengthens the security of information by replacing ineffective authentication methods now similarly it increases the privacy of users by avoiding the reveal of personal information now that said it also has its drawbacks like the need for a large amount of computing power in interactive zkp's where many interactions are needed between the prover and verifier computationally intensive algorithms are used the same goes for non-interactive zkp's which require advanced computational capabilities making zkp's unsuitable for slow devices the other challenge is that zkp's don't give a 100 guarantee that the provers information is true mathematically speaking now in our example we saw that as you continue to exit the cave as per the path requested by jerry the probability of you lying about knowing the secret code decreases with each iteration however it can never reach zero to give a 100 guarantee so then what about its applications zkp has already been applied in many industries including crypto for instance zcash uses a type of zero knowledge cryptographic method to introduce more privacy to its blockchain unlike public blockchains like ethereum and bitcoin it provides complete privacy when it comes to transactions zero knowledge proof is also applied in sectors such as finance the ing bank uses a type of zkp that allows users to prove that they have a secret number that lies in a known range for example a mortgage applicant could prove that their salary sits within a certain range without revealing the exact figure zkp can also be applied in authentication where users can be authenticated without exchanging secret information such as passwords overall zkp is a concept that points us in the right direction technology wise especially in this digital age where platforms collect our data and sell it for profit so what do you think of zero knowledge proof do you believe it will catch on going forward well let us know in the comments and of course remember to

1eX_GAJNBjM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eX_GAJNBjM,[Music] for the first time in 19 months bitcoin's price fell below the 20 000 mark leading to a lot of doubt fear and unanswered questions among investors why are the prices plummeting has the bitcoin bubble burst will bitcoin survive well let's try to unpack some recent events related to the crash and also find out what influential people in the space are seeing all right let's get into it okay first things first why is bitcoin crashing well it's important to note that this isn't bitcoin's first ever crash in fact it has crashed multiple times from 2011 to date and the first crash tied to the mount gox hacking incident that happened in 2011. so mount gox was the largest crypto exchange at the time where the majority of bitcoin was held and traded the hack cost bitcoin's price to fall by over 99 in just one day and the second crash happened two years later when bitcoin reached the then all-time high at around 1151 dollars in early december the cause this time was the chinese government's decision to ban banks and other financial institutions from trading and storing bitcoin in 2017 another crash commonly referred to as the crypto winter happened before crashing bitcoin had gone on an impressive rally that saw its price increase tenfold however this was short-lived just after hitting its all-time high then at 19 497 dollars it experienced a 29 drop and traded at around thirteen thousand dollars only six days later but unfortunately it kept getting worse and 12 months later bitcoin was trading at around three thousand dollars recording an 83 drop over the same period now the 2020 crash happened due to covet which affected virtually every sector during the early days of the pandemic bitcoin experienced a 37 drop in value on the same day but just a year later bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were flying bitcoin went on to hit its new all-time high in november 2021 at around 69 000 so this was eight months ago bitcoin is currently trading at around 20 000 a 71 drop from its all-time high last year so then what caused the 2022 crash well it all started with the terra luna fiasco terrace crash not only affected tara's investors but the whole crypto ecosystem terra or ust is a stable coin that had a market capitalization of over 18 million before the crash ust however is an algorithmic stable coin basically it's not backed one to one by us dollars like usdt or usd instead it relies on a two token seniority model that involves luna now we're not going to deep dive into the nitty gritty details here all you need to know is that eventually usc lost its dollar peg while luna was also crashing leading to the price of luna spiraling to almost zero this wiped over 40 billion out of the crypto market additionally lunas foundation had to sell off over 50 000 bitcoins in an attempt to save ust's peg which exerted a direct downward pressure on the price of bitcoin so this happened back in may and bitcoin and cryptocurrencies haven't recovered ever since that said luna's crash was just one of the catalysts since bitcoin's price was already steadily falling since the beginning of the year many experts hold global inflation rising interest rates the ukraine russia war and recession fairs to be some of the prime architects responsible for this bear market a major falling price came after the release of may's inflation report and in a bid to cool down inflation the u.s federal reserve decided to increase the interest rate in just a couple of days bitcoin's price dropped by around 32 experts and crypto skeptics had a lot to say about this so in an interview with next advisor anthony pompiano a crypto expert and co-founder of morgan creek digital assets emphasized how crypto is not immune to macroeconomic factors anthony said it is important to understand that bitcoin's current drawdown in price is largely driven by changes in the macro economy increases in interest rates coupled with quantitative tightening have driven correlations across assets towards one and we are seeing asset price sell-offs across the financial market he advises investors to control their emotions and to make decisions based on value and not price other experts like martin hesbuck head of blockchain and crypto research at uphold agrees with anthony as he strongly believes that the market is still very vulnerable primarily due to the difficult economic situation that we are facing right now now that said there are skeptics who don't believe in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general matt soler of the american economic liberties project recently tweeted i have no idea if bitcoin or ethereum will go to zero i hope they do and soon but my guess is that crypto will never become wholly worthless but it will eventually become irrelevant like the beanie baby frenzy of the 1990s whatever the sentiment though many experts believe that with no end in sight the war inflation and shifting monetary policy in the us will likely continue to drive more volatility in the coming weeks and months it's not only crypto investors and skeptics who are closely watching the digital asset markets regulators have had crypto in their crosshairs for the longest time and the recent events have fueled calls for regulation cryptocurrencies have been positioning themselves as an alternative to fiat but now more than ever it will be difficult to dispute the regulation claims considering crypto lost over 2 trillion in value between now and november last year while stable coins were always likely to be the first victims of regulation the tara fiasco may accelerate regulatory action after the terror collapse u.s treasury secretary janet yellen called for a comprehensive framework governing stable coins and urged congress to act the sec was even reported to be investigating the marketing of terror usd by terraform labs plus recently prosecutors in korea blocked terror developers daniel shin and dou kwon from leaving the country amid an investigation into the usc crash what would regulation mean for investors anyway there is a mixed reaction regarding crypto regulation with some who are for it arguing that it could mean stability for cryptocurrencies which would result in better protection of investors funds while anti-regulation crypto enthusiasts argue that regulation poses a big threat to crypto's biggest feature which is decentralization well we can only wait and see how regulators are going to act if at all and how fast that will happen so all in all only time will tell if bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will weather the storm but one thing for sure is that while bitcoin has had its good moments the ride has not been smooth on the bright side though bitcoin has survived crashes before and whatever happens in the future the underlying technology is here to stay and its applications will continue spanning more than just digital currencies

CajfFDmoFAo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CajfFDmoFAo,as we all know cryptocurrency is a hot commodity right now and with great value comes great risk unfortunately that means that cryptocurrencies are often the target of hackers today we will look at the top five biggest hacks in the history of crypto note that this video is not to scare you away from crypto but rather to educate you on what's going on so that you're informed cryptocurrency has been around for quite some time now and with its meteoric rise and value it's no surprise that hackers have taken an interest in it as well in 2021 alone a series of hacking attacks exploits and arbitrage caused the loss of more than two billion dollars in cryptocurrency in total billions more have been lost to a string of hacking attacks that exploit vulnerabilities within the network's security system over the years crypto exchanges d5 protocols and cross chain bridges have a huge target on their backs since they custody a lot of funds opportunistic hackers constantly scan platforms and smart contracts for vulnerabilities if they get lucky they transfer users cryptocurrencies to their own wallets sometimes without the platform's knowledge where many of these exploits only come to light after users start to report that they are unable to access their funds in this video we're going to take a look at the top cryptocurrency hacks in history we'll answer questions about how the attacks took place the steps taken to recover lost funds whether customers receive their money back and how the company or project is currently doing these are the most expensive hacks yet some of these hacks resulted in millions of dollars worth of losses so buckle up get ready for a wild ride coming at number one is the ronin network hack in march 2022 ronan network an ethereum ethereum-linked sidechain that powers axey infiniti a popular game in which players battle with pets called axes to earn cryptocurrencies and nfts was hacked the network lost a total of 624 million dollars in the form of 25.5 million usdc and 173 600 each making it the most expensive crypto hack of all time reports claim that the hacker transferred 540 million dollars worth of cryptocurrency to their wallet however ronan network only realized the missing cryptocurrency six days later when a customer reported that they couldn't withdraw 5000 e which was 17 million dollars at the time after this incident they went on to realize that over 624 million dollars worth of crypto had been stolen so how did hackers execute what may be the largest hack in history all while the company was unaware funds were being moved illegally well according to the ronin network the hacker forged two withdrawals using hacked private keys here's how before the attack the network had nine validator nodes to make a valid transaction you'd need five out of nine validator signatures according to ronin network's report the hacker discovered a back door via ronan's gas free remote procedure call rpc node which they used to gain control of the five validator private keys required to make withdrawals in response to the attack ronan network increased the number of validator nodes from five to eight they stopped all transactions on the network and disabled exchanges like finance and katana dex from transacting with the network as a result the hackers had few ways to move this stolen cryptocurrency from their wallet and convert it to actual cash ronin network is currently working with forensic cryptographers investors and government agencies to find those responsible for the attack at the moment they claim the stolen funds to still be in the hacker's wallet ronan has also suspended all network transactions and claims that all stolen funds will be recovered and reimbursed to its customers in the future coming in as the second largest hack in history is last year's august 2021 paulie network attack valued at 611 million dollars in stolen funds poly network is a cross-chain bridge that enables transfers of assets between different blockchains by locking and unlocking tokens on either side of the bridge polynetwork allows users to seamlessly convert their tokens to another currency for example let's say you have some eth on the ethereum blockchain but you want to convert it to btc on the bitcoin blockchain with polynetwork you can lock your eth on the ethereum network and unlock your btc on the bitcoin network the process is simple and straightforward and it doesn't require you to give up custody of your assets during the transfer so how did paulie networks hack happen the hacker or hackers were able to exploit a flaw in the code of the polynetwork smart contract they found a way to unlock tokens without locking them on other blockchains this means that they were buying tokens without selling the corresponding amount in a surprising twist the hackers started returning the stolen funds a day after the attack to date poly network has managed to recover all the 611 million dollars that the hacker returned all the crypto he had taken reports claimed that paulie network offered the hacker a chief security advisor position at the company plus a 500 000 bounty to restore the remaining funds it's unclear whether he'll cave and accept the bounty but in any case it seems poly network may have gained from the attack to revamp its security features they claim to have no intention of holding the hacker legally responsible february 2022 marked the first hack of the year where wormhole a communication bridge between solana and other decentralized finance d5 networks lost 120 000 w eth valued at 326 million dollars the hacker exploited a security fix uploaded to github but was not deployed onto the live application itself reports suggest that the hacker might have been tipped off of the security flaw by an insider before the patch update was deployed to the project itself in response wormhole stopped all transactions pending investigations they also offered a 10 million dollar bounty to the hacker to return the stolen funds the amount stolen largely affected wormhole's one-to-one eath to w eath ratio as a result a 10 drop in value of solana and a 5 drop of ethereum ensued in the aftermath to make sure that the one-to-one peg was not affected jump the firm that had acquired the developers of wormhole certain one bailed them out by providing the 326 million dollars that had been stolen in december 2021 bitmart a cryptocurrency exchange platform was the victim of a 196 million dollar hacking attack the day after the attack bitmark founder and ceo sheldon shah announced on twitter that a large-scale security breach had been discovered in two of their ethereum and binance smart chain hot wallets in response to the attack the exchange stopped all withdrawals while they conducted a security review to determine the possible loophole the attackers exploited the company discovered a stolen private key that they claim to have only comprised two wallets apart from the two comprised wallets the company reports that other assets remain safe and unharmed bitmart further confirmed that they will reimburse customers for anything they lost during the hack weeks later many users claim that they did not receive any form of reimbursement little is known about how exactly hackers stole the private key to two wallets or whether all customers got back full reimbursements at the moment though it appears that business at bitmarked is on as usual concluding our list of the top crypto hacks is the beanstalk hack beanstalk an ethereum based stablecoin d5 platform lost a total of 181 million dollars in april 2022 due to a hacking attack that exploited the network's governance model according to pex shield the security firm hired to investigate the hack the hacker got away with 80 million dollars in cryptocurrency with the platform's losses totaling to 181 million dollars claim that the attacker used the platform's flash loan feature which allows users to borrow large amounts of cryptocurrency for liquidity or arbitrage opportunities the hacker took out one billion dollars worth of crypto which they use to gain super majority voter status as per the platform's proof of stake protocol allowing them to create and accept proposals and consequently withdraw funds from beanstalk in a single transaction following the attack beanstalk plummeted in minutes losing roughly 80 percent of its dollar peg they offered a bounty of 10 of the stolen amount in exchange for the attacker returning the remaining 90 but in an unexpected turn of events the hacker donated 250 000 usdc to ukraine moving forward the company launched the barn raise fundraiser on june 6 2022 to help restore the platform's liquidity they plan to relaunch the platform in early july as you might expect the road to recovering stolen funds is long and difficult to ensure your cryptocurrency remains safe from hacking attacks always do prior research on a platform's security features as a precaution make sure to keep only what you can afford to lose in online crypto wallets

xk5DAjVsp0g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk5DAjVsp0g,as you probably know blockchain technology is changing the music industry in a big way so in this video i'm going to show you how web 3 and music nfts are changing the game for artists and fans alike and list a few companies where you can buy and trade music clips in crypto alright let's get into it [Applause] so there's no doubt that the music industry is in a state of flux in 2021 alone it's estimated that the music industry contributed 26 billion to the economy globally however the artists whose work promotes this market space earn only 12 of the revenues but with the advent of web3 and the rise of blockchain based platforms it's now possible for artists to cut out the middleman and distribute their music directly to fans as nfts so what are web 3 and music nfts well if you're new to this web 3 is a transformative concept of reinventing the world wide web by incorporating blockchain technology while web 2.0 power is a streaming platform we use today like spotify and apple music web 3 is the decentralized web where users are in control of their data it's powered by ethereum and other blockchain technologies that allow for the creation of temper-proof digital assets called non-fungible tokens or nfts so music nfts on the other hand are music clips or videos stored on a blockchain they are uniquely created by an artist who sells the music nft's ownership rights for a certain price once sold the artists may continue earning royalty fees off of any future sale of their artwork on the network and because nfts are stored on the blockchain authentication is easy based on an nft's metadata and the logs of transactions you can easily trace the trail of ownership of an nft combined these two technologies are transforming how artists make a living today artists have a fair chance to receive deserving value for their work to put it into perspective beijing rapper halique mall annual spotify earnings were an estimated 178 dollars however the artists earnings on catalog an nft marketplace built specifically for the music industry skyrocketed to about 81 ethereum from only five sales now at the time let me tell you 81 ethereum was worth more than a cool 250 000 so then how do web 3 and music nfts work well it's pretty impressive how fast nfts are transforming the creative industry and with web3 technologies the internet will soon allow artists to regain control of their r so here's how web 3 uses like i said a decentralized infrastructure so in essence web3 streaming services cut off the middleman and instead encourages peer-to-peer interactions so therefore web3 streaming services give control to the people who collectively participate in making decisions on how the platforms should run on the other hand music nfts are digitally tokenized forms of music clips eps albums or music videos that you can buy and sell like any other product on the market so these tokens are unique digital identifiers whose value is determined by a global nft marketplace the artist sets a fixed quantity like 1 25 or 1 000 and a price for a token then uploads the token for any fan to come and place a bid or make a purchase once the purchase is complete the digital token is then transferred to the buyer's wallet at any point in the future the buyer can decide to re-list the token for sale with the original artist entitled to earning a certain percentage of the sale proceeds the beauty of web3 and music nfts is that anyone can mint their music as nfts on web3 platforms and since there are often no intermediaries like labels or agents artists get to keep up to one hundred percent of their royalty payments so what are the benefits of web3 and music nfts you may be wondering okay well why bother buying music and tease when i can already listen to the music track on itunes or spotify for example well there's two sides to the coin first collectors see value in owning rare provable unique and original assets the second perk is that music nfts provide investment opportunities in an artist in case the artist becomes popular the value of their music nfts spike up at this point you can relist their music nfts at a price of your choosing now fans also get to benefit they send a chance to get more from buying music nfts like through gaining access to discounted concerts or special meetups with the artist what's more web3 also enables listeners to earn from just listening to nft music see with whip 3 fans get a partial share of the songs they buy as nfts and just like how buying cryptocurrencies work the more they listen to a song the more its value goes up giving them some royalties in return this is something that never happened in web 2.0 these incentives help foster a fans network that depends entirely on how the artist wants to connect with their fans okay so then you're probably wondering which web3 platforms you can start selling or buying music nfts from well let's take a look at a couple so first we have audience so think of audience like spotify or sound cloud but on the blockchain so audios is a blockchain based decentralized web 3 music streaming and sharing platform that aims to connect artists to their fan base for free now unlike web 2.0 platforms audience doesn't take a cut out of artists revenue instead it has a reward system where artists get paid for topping the audience charts they receive 90 of the revenue in audio while the other 10 goes to supporting stakers on the network now keep in mind that audience doesn't allow minting nfts as it is purely a place to listen to music and then we have emanate so m a is pretty similar to audience the main difference is m a pays artists and its native token per stream as opposed to a reward system also for every six dollars emanate makes from the emanate music lovers group sign up five dollars is passed on to the artist okay next up async music so asic music is a music specific nft marketplace where artists can mint their tracks async music works differently from other platforms as each track comes with variations that can be purchased separately each uploaded song has many versions of instrumentals and vocals there's however a master nft that randomly compiles them together in one master track then we have dao records taos or decentralized autonomous organizations is a form of crypto based investment corporations in the case of dow records they are reinventing record labels to democratize the music industry through virtual events and audio nfts here you can connect your wallet discover your favorite artist and start collecting new music so why do web3 and music nfts matter well from the perspective of the music industry musicians typically make a living through streaming platforms such as spotify or apple music when a person buys a certain track a part of the revenue will go to the artist this is a one-time purchase with third-party platforms agents and marketing costs gobbling up the majority of the revenue and also music clips are easily pirated in the majority of these cases artists hardly get any income for their creative effort but thanks to web3 and music nfts artists can now get paid in crypto for their work and continue earning royalty rights when their nft is resold on the network so there is an immense need for web3 and music nfts to support and give power back to artists so that wraps it up for what you should know about web3 and music nft so what do you think do you think that they are the next big thing well we'd love to know

4EYvXcCJVDI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EYvXcCJVDI,what is cbdc no not cbd central bank digital currency yes it's a mouthful but it's something important you should know about as it may change the way we use fiat currencies in this video we're gonna find out the goals of cbdc the difference between cbdc and crypto as well as the issues it may solve and create all right let's get into it so a central bank digital currency or cbdc is a digital form of a country's fiat currency it is similar to cryptocurrency except that it's issued by a central bank and it may not necessarily be on the blockchain but you might be wondering how does cbdc differ from the money in my bank account well the money in your bank is typically not legal tender rather it's a promise of the bank to provide you with the physical cash which is legal tender upon your request usually banks do keep their promise but if you keep your money in the bank and something happens to the bank like bankruptcy the promise breaks and you would effectively lose all your money on the other hand cbdc is legal tender and you won't be at risk when banks fail so why are governments considering creating a central bank digital currency well cbdc's could potentially promote financial inclusion protection against fraud and accelerate the transition to a cashless society which has been made even more desirable due to the covet 19 pandemic now these goals are motivated by the problems in the current financial system which cbdc aims to solve so let's go over some of these problems okay problem number one bank failures as it is legal tender cbdc eliminates the third-party risk of events like bank runs and if there is any remaining risk the central banks are the ones held accountable then problem number two high cross-border transaction costs when transferring money to someone in another country you would typically be charged a high transaction fee but with cbdc the cost can be lowered as governments would increase their jurisdictional cooperation to make the distribution system less complicated problem number three the unbanked cbdc's would be more accessible to the unbanked as the typical banking requirements just won't apply to access the digital money you would only need an app on your mobile phone problem number four expensive financial infrastructure cbdcs can establish a direct connection between consumers and central banks and as such this could eliminate the cost of building financial infrastructure while these problems may be solved cbdc's could also potentially create other problems mainly that the effects on a financial system stability are still unknown for example there may not be enough central bank liquidity to facilitate withdrawals during a financial crisis central banks will need to ensure that they have the tools to positively influence the economy due to its centralized nature cbdc's would not offer the same kind of privacy that cryptocurrencies do authorities would be needed to monitor for financial crimes such as money laundering and the financing of terrorism and furthermore cbdc would be vulnerable to an even larger surface of attack as they have not overcome issues like setbacks and operating technology or exchange security failure yes cryptocurrencies have gone through some notable cyber threats such as the 51 attacks on blockchains but these attacks are proof that blockchains are battle tested what's more central banks are still struggling with protections for their current paper currency which has been going on for centuries rival states and financially motivated hackers have reportedly found centralized points of failure within central banks the bottom line is that while the potential benefits of cbdc's seem attractive we still don't know how they would affect the economy so this is why many countries are still investigating the technical and economic feasibility of digital money so far there are nine countries and territories that have launched cbdc's and 14 countries are in the pilot stage but without new standards and international coordination the financial system may face a significant interoperability problem in the future so what do you think would cbdc be the next evolution of the financial system well we'd love to hear your thoughts so comment down below and of course don't forget to like subscribe and hit the notification bell for more videos like this see you next time [Music] [Music] you,Youtube video,What is CBDC?

nft to ape nft a tron based project which is dedicated to tokenizing artwork on the blockchain cryptopunk number 7523 is an uncommon alien its medical mask feature also lends it a special topicality

Kiqjbc23m4g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiqjbc23m4g,hi there a quick question how big of a role do you think investors emotions play in the price movements of a market well think of your answer and then let us know at the end of the video after we talk about the psychology of a market cycle okay let's define some terms First Market Cycles what are they well Market Cycles are trends that emerge during difficult markets or business environments they're usually the period between two lows or two highs for instance at the time of this video we may be in the beginning middle or even the end of a market cycle of a certain asset investors try to analyze Market Cycles to decide when to enter into a market with the goal of making maximum profit though these patterns are tricky to identify especially when you're in the middle of it all right now that you have a rough idea of what Market Cycles are let's take a look at Market psychology what is it well it is the idea that the movements of a market are influenced or reflect the emotional state of its participants so think of bitcoin's last Bull Run for example many people had positive sentiments towards the digital asset right well usually positive sentiments go hand in hand with a rise in demand and as an effect the prices also rise now of course the reverse is also true in that negative sentiments about an asset cause its demand to reduce so how do emotions change during the market Cycles well let's dive into the 14 stages of the psychology of a market cycle and we'll use this chart right here from Wall Street cheat sheet as a guide and as you can see the y-axis represents the price of the asset while the x-axis represents the time or the ongoing period of the cycle with that said let's take a look at the first stage which is disbelief this stage comes after a bear Market at this point moods are low and investors are skeptical about rallies and run-ups thinking that the price will eventually fall back down but it doesn't the asset steadily maintains its upward trend and now there is a little cloud of optimism among investors this leads us to stage number two hope at this stage optimism grows even further now from the chart you'll notice that the price may be moving up sideways or even down sometimes but there is still a belief that recovery from the bear Market is possible and the overall upward movement of the price will hold this marks the beginning of a bull market all right now on to stage three which is optimism at this point there is a solid belief among many investors that the upswing in prices is real so notice from the graph how prices are rising quicker than before towards the end of this stage investors are ready to act on their sentiments and when they do we usher in a new stage belief this is where investors even the ones that were skeptical start making their comeback into the market there is a real belief here that this is indeed a Bull Run so it's time to finally invest your money and after some time it does pay off investors get real profits and this marks the fifth stage of the cycle which is thrill so this is typically where you would start to encounter invite experts on YouTube Tick Tock you name it telling you how much they invested and how much profit they got and now everyone in their Grandma can do just as well investing in Bitcoin and what not and so as a result more people even those with little to no knowledge about the asset jump on the bandwagon due to fomo the price rally might continue and new all-time highs may even be hit at this point of the cycle this stage is called Euphoria a stage filled with a lot of self padding and fantasies of riches and this stage May Mark The End Of The Bull Run and now the prices may start to steadily fall bringing us to Stage seven complacency now remember how there was disbelief at the beginning of the cycle the same thing happens at this stage only that this time some investors don't want to believe that the recent high prices were the end of the bull run and are still optimistic that new Highs are coming despite the recent drops but the drops become more evident and anxiety sets in among investors as the recent price pullbacks now evolve into a downward Trend regardless there still may be a hesitation to sell and this hesitation breeds stage 9 denial at this stage investors are like I'm holding good long-term Investments anyway so I'm just gonna stay in the market no matter what but as the prices continue to plummet and seeing that fellow investors are selling Panic sets in here investors start considering getting out of the market and salvaging the capital they have left they may still be 50 50 D on whether to sell or weather the storm by sticking to the initial hoddle game plan but as prices continue going down the game plan is thrown out of the window bringing us to the 11th stage capitalation investors finally decide to sell due to fear of losing their whole Capital after selling the investors may be dealing with many emotions but the prevailing one is anger they start asking questions like who made me lose all my money how did this happen and they grow angry at whatever they believe caused the bear market and the loss of their gains and when there are no answers to these questions and the realization that even if there were answers things couldn't be changed the cycle gets to stage 13 depression so at this point investors blame themselves for giving up all their bull market profits by not leaving the market in time though finally after the bear map if the prices start to rise marking the end of the old cycle and the beginning of a new one so a good example of how prices affect Market psychology and vice versa is bitcoin's Bull Run in 2017. so let's bring up the chart and see what went down during that period Bitcoin kicked off the year trading at around nine hundred dollars six months later the price had doubled and in December Bitcoin was trading at a new all-time high 20 000 but this was short-lived as less than a month later Bitcoin lost half of its value at this point we're in the second half of the market cycle bitcoin's price continue to fall in 2018 until a new cycle began in 2019. while people who entered the market early may have made some profit regardless investors who got in late say a bitcoin's peak in that cycle would have suffered significant losses if they decided to sell due to Panic All In All the whole idea is to use this cycle to choose the best time to enter a market and this could be when people are selling however this may also backfire if the prices continue to plummet leading to losses and mainly it's just because it's much harder to understand how the market is changing as it goes than it is to look back at Market cycles and recognize how the overall psychology changed so remember the question that I asked you at the beginning of the video while I'm wondering do you believe that investors emotions play a part in how the market behaves well make sure to let us know what you think in the comments and of course also remember to like subscribe and follow us on all

2SlLK4m0Gec,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SlLK4m0Gec,cryptocurrencies are becoming the talk of the town city coins a non-profit open source protocol has devised a way for users of its website to earn bitcoin by supporting the cities they care about in fact miami and new york two major cities have already established their own city coins these coins allow residents to use their crypto assets to improve the lives of people in their own city or another community in exchange for a bitcoin reward [Music] city coins presents itself as a way for residents to produce cryptocurrency-based money for themselves and their communities consider it a system that allows users to donate cryptocurrency to their local city or to assist other cities in return for benefits users of the city coins platforms have already started issuing tokens for a few big cities with the goal of improving the lives of those who reside there surprisingly the project has chosen to run on a bitcoin based ecosystem allowing users and cities to possibly earn bitcoin the stax protocol which supports smart contracts on the bitcoin blockchain is the foundation for city coins the protocol employs a revolutionary proof of transfer consensus mechanism that pays miners with stacks stx while simultaneously rewarding stackers with btc for locking their stx in the protocol for a period of time stax a blockchain technology implemented on top of the bitcoin network to allow smart contract applications is responsible for all of citycoin's bitcoin-powered implementations citycoins runs on the stacks blockchain which is a technological extension of the bitcoin blockchain that includes smart contract functionality allowing it to make use of smart contract technology while still retaining bitcoin security fabric the idea is to create a system that rewards users for their efforts to keep the system afloat while also generating revenue for the development of certain towns citycoins unlike other crypto projects has chosen to use various token schemes it may use this architecture to generate a unique token for each supported city [Music] federal governments have a lot of authority and control inside a country notably in economics especially when it comes to allocating federal cash and resources different cities or states within a country on the other hand frequently have their own distinct demands that must be handled at the local level and rely on local finance the city coins initiative has provided three main use cases for city coins in general when it comes to financial incentives some of the obvious ways city coins are useful are discounts on sporting events and other activities for city coins holders high performing students may be rewarded or automated lotteries may be used to assist pay for student tuition being distributed as grants or collateralized loans to encourage crypto entrepreneurs and other enterprises to their city community governance exists in city coins similar to the dow voting methods for example users might delegate their tokens to help modernize their cities by sponsoring new projects such as free wi-fi or new solar panel installations cities may pool their tokens to propose and vote on regional ideas and projects which can then be funded using city coins in terms of access controls city coin holders may be granted exclusive access to real and digital locations and services imagine creating a worldwide network of decentralized we work style co-working living spaces that require city coins to access users could even utilize a decentralized city-specific domain register as a personal crypto wallet and app dashboard two cities in the united states of america have already begun to accumulate stx and their municipal wallets miami and new york miami coin mia dollars was released in august 2021 as the first city coins token with the goal of rewarding miners and providing holders with stx and bitcoin miami coin as its name suggests is a way for miami residents to contribute to the city's growth while also receiving incentives for their efforts as a result when a miner contributes sdx to the miami smart contract the miner may get miami coins as a reward more crucially a percentage of the deposit will go to the city of miami's coffers nyc coin is a variation of the city coins tokens created with the goal of fostering a thriving crypto ecosystem in new york nyc coin like miami coin provides a way for people to contribute to the city of new york's economic progress eric adams the incoming mayor of new york city has already declared his support for nyc coins running a city and boosting local civic movements are difficult responsibilities and cities and local civic groups require all the assistance they can receive especially during pandemics when financial resources are likely to be much more limited there is little question that additional towns will use such tokens if fresh revenue sources can be located swiftly and provided effectively to put things in perspective miami coins 20 million dollars in income for the city of miami in 2021 is two percent of the 877 million dollars the city expects to receive in revenue for its general fund in 2022 a tiny but respectable amount considering the token was just introduced in august since the launch of miami coin city coins has stated that new york city under the leadership of freshly elected mayor eric adams will be the next city to get nyc coin followed by austin while each city will surely profit from the first windfall how it decides to collaborate with the city coins initiative and if compelling usefulness and use cases are built out for its local community will be critical to the project's long-term viability and success what are

MC8d9Qgd3gM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC8d9Qgd3gM,while basking in the glory of bitcoin during the crypto boom of 2017 many all coins like bitcoin cash litecoin and monero became popular in their own right but when the price of bitcoin fell in 2018 nearly all other cryptocurrencies fell along with it despite the crash bitcoin has survived through the years and continues to be the holy grail in crypto trading and investment but what about the other coins that were popular back then were they now do they still hold any value well let's find out so in 2017 the bitcoin community had differences in opinion over the future of the protocol a group of bitcoin developers wanted a cryptocurrency that can perform cheap everyday transactions despite being named the peer-to-peer electronic cash in its white paper bitcoin was not well suited for used as cash for everyday purchases due to its high fee so this group proposed a technical solution and released a new version of bitcoin software that allows for a larger number of transactions with smaller fees the other majority group of bitcoin developers however disagreed because a larger blockchain is harder to validate and would compromise bitcoin's decentralized nature so because of this a fork was created and an entirely separate blockchain bitcoin cash was born it all seemed promising at the start as bitcoin cash hit a peak in december 2017 but as the years went by despite the good intentions of making everyday payments easier and cheaper it just doesn't seem to be doing so well bitcoin cash has not seen a new high since 2017 not even during the 2021 bull market even so there's still no denying the fact that sending bitcoin cash is still way cheaper than sending bitcoin okay so then let's move on to litecoin so litecoin was created as a fork of bitcoin in 2011. in some ways it's similar to bitcoin as it's based on bitcoin's open source code base but there are a few technological differences one of them being that litecoin uses a different proof of work mining algorithm due to the technological differences litecoin is able to offer faster transaction times and lower fees compared to bitcoin this makes it appealing as a payment option and means of transferring value however the network has significantly fewer miners than bitcoin which means that the security of the network may be negatively impacted in 2017 its price hit a record high up nearly 5800 percent it was the fourth biggest rival of bitcoin at the time but even though the price of litecoin has fallen since its day of glory flycoin has been active in launching a mimblewimble upgrade for the purpose of privacy oriented transactions mimblewimble is a privacy focused decentralized protocol that allows users to conceal transaction information this sounds great but because of this added privacy several crypto exchanges like binance and those in south korea have stopped supporting litecoin transactions due to strict kyc and aml enforcement okay so let's move on to dash so dash is a cryptocurrency that boasts low-cost speedy transactions it was created as a fork of litecoin with a different consensus algorithm which is the proof of stake now the unique thing about dash is that it offers optional speed and privacy features the private send feature gives users added anonymity based on a method called coin join which is essentially grouping transactions together so that individual transaction details can be concealed in 2021 dash launched a retail focused app called dash direct to boost crypto adoption the app gives users discounts on purchases made with participating retailers in the us cointelegraph reports that over 20 investment funds are holding dash this year and it's predicted that 40 more will add it in their portfolio let's move on to iota so iota is a pivot from an internet of things microprocessor venture called gin the pivot stemmed from concerns around the regulatory soundness of gin tokens and so in 2015 the non-profit iota foundation was developed for iot devices that utilize cryptographic techniques now the interesting thing about iota is that it does not have blocks miners or transaction fees as are common in most public blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum the reason well to allow the scalability and speed necessary for machine to machine transactions how it works is that each transaction validates the previous two transactions achieving consensus first locally and then globally now iota took a big hit early this year during bitcoin's price slump however it did not deter the development of the iota ecosystem as well as the collaboration with dell to develop real-time carbon footprint tracking and iota foundation has also partnered with imperial college london to launch a distributed ledger technology to develop solutions for circular economic models around servitization so if climate solutions is something that you're interested in you'd better keep an eye out on this project i out eye out keep an eye out let's let's move on known as the new economy movement blockchain nem is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and development platform what makes nem unique is its consensus algorithm called the proof of importance how it works is that if a user of the nem blockchain holds more than 10 000 xcm tokens they will have an important score from that point on every coin on their account and every transaction made will improve their importance score a higher score means an increased likelihood in getting mining rewards in july 2021 the demand for nem search higher than that of bitcoin and who knows we might just see a resurgence in 2022 again in the crypto world monero is synonymous with privacy and unlike bitcoin monero allows anonymous and untraceable transactions by default the fact that transactions on the monero blockchain can't be tracked made it one of the most popular coins in 2017. while it has not achieved a new all-time high since then monero still remains one of the top cryptocurrencies today in the current bear market it is experiencing fewer losses than its top rivals like bitcoin fears of strict regulations in the crypto market may have played a hand in the increased demand for monero this year okay let's move on to stellar so stellar became popular in 2017 after it announced a partnership with ibm that aims to set up multiple currency corridors among nations in the south pacific with this institutional adoption as well as the appeal of cross border transfers the value of lumen stellar's cryptocurrency grew by 34 900 so what differentiates stellar from other blockchains is the implementation of the stellar consensus protocol so this model foregoes proof of work consensus for a federated system that uses mutual trust among groups of peers the prospect of stellar lumen today seems promising so it may be worth being on stellar watch so it's not all doom and gloom in this crypto bear market there is hope and the protocols of these altcoins are working behind the scenes to keep them afloat so which one are you rooting for well comment below and let us know what you think also don't forget to subscribe

B_Z1PKYqbdQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_Z1PKYqbdQ,hey there welcome to the how to coin gecko mobile edition but first did you know that coin gecko is the go-to site for live crypto prices listings for the crypto Community well now you know even better there's a mobile app available for IOS and Android devices so now you have the largest collection of unbiased crypto Market Data actionable Insights news tools and More in one place in the palm of your hands these amazing features will cost you about zero dollars yes the app is absolutely free so what are you waiting for this video will be a Super Simple Guide to the coin gecko mobile app and by the end you'll know how to get the best out of this powerful app make sure to watch the whole video to find out how people are winning tickets free books VPN plans and more by just using this free app ready let's begin every time you launch the app this will be the default home page it basically displays the most significant details of listed coins which are ranked by market cap all that information may seem a little too much for crypto newcomers so let's break it down let's start with the price column which displays the latest price of the coins by the way these prices may vary from the ones on crypto exchanges because coin gecko tracks the price from different exchanges to provide a global volume weighted average price alright on to the next column you'll notice that the figures are in percentages some in red some in green these percentages represent the difference between the current price and the price 24 hours ago green meaning positive and red meaning negative the app shows a 24-hour Difference by default but you can tweak this by clicking the button with a drop down arrow just above the price change column and choosing one of the other two options one hour or 7 day price percentage change now let's look at the last column labeled as market cap which is market capitalization in full this is an important metric for investors as it gives them an idea of the total value of a coin how do we get this value the market cap is equal to the price of one coin multiplied by the total number of coins in circulation Bitcoin for example at the time of making this video has a total supply of 19 million 67 125 and each Bitcoin goes for around twenty two thousand dollars to get the market cap of Bitcoin we multiply the two together and that will give us the value displayed here you'll notice that the market cap has a small arrow pointing downwards if you click on it the coins will now be ranked in ascending order also just above the market cap column is a sort by button let's click on it to see some of the different options the app offers the first option is to sort by rank which when activated still ranks the coins by market cap the other option is to sort by the percentage change basically the coins with the biggest price change are ranked first now let's select any coin say ethereum this brings us to the coins page where we get all the information that we need about the project you'll notice that now we can access more information about ethereum than we could on the home page for instance we can now get a better idea of its price movement through the chart which can be tweaked to display the trend between different periods and clicking the price button on the right will give you an option to replace the curve with candlesticks the market cap option on the other hand will display the trend of the market cap across different periods below the chart features different percentage changes as you can see the periods available here are longer to give you a better overview of the price trend over longer periods scrolling further down we'll get to see more information regarding ethereum like the trading volume 24 hour high and low to name a few further below there is an option to buy cryptocurrency note that coin gecko is not an exchange and you'll be redirected to our partners exchanges instead let's swipe right and explore the exchanges tab this page will show the exchanges that have listed your coin of interest and their latest prices the last column informs you of The credibility of the exchanges on the list basically green is a good sign and whereas the red one probably requires a bit more scrutiny try as much as possible to always use trusted exchanges and do additional research to find out what your fellow investors are saying about the exchange you intend to use all right on to one of the coolest features of the app the portfolio tool this tool allows you to track your investment in a simple way let's see how it works practically since we are still on the ethereum coin page it'll show us how much ethereum we own you'll just need to click on the add transaction button and input the amount of eth that you own or bought recently and voila when we click on ADD transaction again we can see that there are more options like sell and transfer say we sell 0.5 each we just input the value and to get more accurate balances there's an option to input the fees incurred just above the cancel button so we can add those details and submit them and now our portfolio will be instantly updated remember that you can always access the portfolio tool from the home page here you'll just have more flexibility to add any coin you want to your portfolio just tap the plus button at the top right of your screen and search for your desired coin when you click on the coin you'll get a pop-up informing you that the coin has been successfully added to your portfolio on the far right of the coin click on the plus button fill in the details and submit you'll notice that the total value of your portfolio changes clicking on the chart button will automatically generate and display an easy to digest chart that shows the different percentages each coin takes in your portfolio that's not all you can create different portfolios for different investment strategies one portfolio might contain coins you intend to hold for a long time while the other might contain short-term Investments so it's totally up to you to create a new portfolio click on the drop down arrow at the top center part of your screen a bonus tip you can launch the settings page by pressing the more button on the bottom right of your screen then navigate to the default start screen setting and choose portfolio basically when you launch the app your portfolio will be on the home page instead of the market page okay let's now explore the three remaining menus that is categories exchanges and derivatives the categories page Will Group coins together depending on their ecosystem or Niche this will give you an easier time finding some coins that you might have otherwise missed on the list the exchange page on the other hand ranks exchanges according to the volume as you can see binance is currently the most popular exchange with a trust score of 10. like we said only use exchanges that you can 100 trust the derivatives page ranks the exchanges that have derivatives available for trading crypto derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from cryptocurrencies this tab ranks the exchanges by open interest which simply means the total number of derivatives contracts that have not been settled yet let's look at other helpful features like the search tab this tool allows you to find any of the Thirteen thousand plus coins listed on coin gecko also on the search page we added a cool feature that informs you of the coins that are being searched the most by your fellow investors this may come in handy in helping you find some hidden gems another important feature created for your convenience is the explore option this is basically a One-Stop shop for information regarding crypto this includes news from trusted sources in-depth articles and guides our podcasts featuring industry leaders and our insightful daily newsletter that you should totally consider signing up for whether you are a beginner or a seasoned crypto investor there's something for you in the explore tab did someone say candy Rewards yes you

5vW7hX6k5ho,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vW7hX6k5ho,did you know that there are ways to invest in bitcoin without holding actual bitcoin this is made possible through financial instruments like derivatives so what are crypto derivatives well that is what we're going to find out shortly including some of the types of crypto derivatives like futures and perpetual contracts so make sure to stick around to find out how they work and how they differ through simple explanations and practical examples all right let's get to it so what are crypto derivatives okay so the word derivative implies that it is derived from something right so in financial terms derivatives are instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset crypto derivatives therefore derive their value from cryptocurrencies they exist as financial contracts that two parties enter into to speculate on the underlying cryptocurrencies price on a future date so for example a futures contract which is a type of crypto derivative will have the parties agree on a selling and buying price of the cryptocurrency in say one month regardless of what the actual price will be so fast forward to one month later the buyer may profit if the price of the underlying cryptocurrency went up and is now higher than the agreed price in the contract and if the price of the underlying cryptocurrency goes down and lies below the agreed price the seller will make a profit because the buyer will be purchasing the asset at a higher price than the actual market price now don't worry we'll look at actual examples shortly when we take a closer look at the types of crypto derivatives now some of these types include options swaps futures and perpetual contracts though for this video we're going to focus on the last two these derivatives generally differ depending on the conditions in the contracts as you'll see shortly let's start with futures what is it well as the name suggests it is a legal agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a set price in the future so before the parties get into the contract they generally agree on two things one is the price at which they will exchange the asset in future and two is the expiration date of the contract which is simply the date the contract will be closed and settled okay so let's find out how crypto futures work through a practical example so say we have two crypto derivative traders mercy and frank who enter into a futures contract when the price of bitcoin is thirty thousand dollars now mercy is bullish on bitcoin and she is confident that it will surpass 30 000 in a month which is the expiration date of the contract this means that she will have to pay 30 000 for one bitcoin regardless of bitcoin's price in a month frank on the other hand is bearish on bitcoin and has his reasons to believe that the price of bitcoin will drop below 30 000 in the coming months so the contract from frank's perspective commits him to selling bitcoin at the agreed price regardless of the assets price in a month okay so let's look at different scenarios that'll determine which of the two makes a profit so scenario one it could be that mercy was right and the price of bitcoin does go up to say 37 000 so now she'll actually be purchasing bitcoin from frank at a discount in this case she'll make a profit of seven thousand dollars without factoring fees and then we have scenario two so let's assume mercy's prediction was wrong and the price of bitcoin went down and is now trading at twenty five thousand dollars well she'll still have to buy the bitcoin from frank at the agreed 30 000 meaning she makes a 5 000 loss while frank makes a 5 000 profit now there's still some nuances to futures but that's generally how it works so then next what about perpetual contracts well perpetual contracts are more or less similar to futures but with one distinct difference in that they have no expiration date so investors can hold their positions however long they like so for this reason perpetual contracts have price pegs to ensure that they are traded at prices that are equal or almost equal to the spot market prices and this price peg is maintained through a premium called a funding premium that is paid between the contract sellers and buyers to help keep the price in line with the spot market so then let's find out how perpetual contracts work so say that mercy decides to invest in perpetual contracts this time when the price of bitcoin is around thirty thousand dollars so since she predicts that the price of bitcoin may go up she decides to purchase a perpetual contract at thirty thousand dollars now after two months the price of bitcoin does indeed go up to forty thousand dollars so mercy who is happy with the ten thousand dollar profit decides to close her position now another thing about crypto derivatives like futures and perpetual contracts is that they offer leverage opportunities so this simply means that it allows you to open a trading position that is bigger than your trading capital so in mercy's case if a derivative exchange offers two times leverage it means that her capital will now double and so will her profit however just as leverage amplifies profits it also amplifies losses so there is a very high risk of being liquidated so let's quickly see how this may happen in mercy's case but before that let's try to break down the following concepts first that is the initial margin and the maintenance margin now the former describes the minimum value that needs to be paid to open a leveraged position so for illustration purposes let's set this value at thirty thousand dollars meaning mercy pays an initial margin of thirty thousand dollars which will act as her collateral to open a two times leverage position the maintenance margin on the other hand is the minimum amount of collateral mercy must hold to keep her trading positions open if bitcoin's prices move against mercy and her margin balance drops below this level she may be asked to add more funds to her account or be liquidated now that said perpetuals are by far the most traded financial instruments in crypto and at the time of making this video the 24-hour volume of perpetuals was over 126 billion compared to futures 5 billion though you might still wonder why not just hold actual bitcoin if the price is pegged to it anyway well these derivatives have an important function in crypto of managing risks so say mercy holds actual bitcoin but the price is going down since she is also a crypto derivative trader she can decide to purchase a derivative contract whose value swings in the opposite direction of the bitcoin she holds ideally now she'll be able to offset the losses of her actual bitcoin with the gains from the derivatives now all in all this collaboration between crypto and traditional financial instruments is a major step forward for digital assets in general and it also gives investors an option to be involved with digital assets without necessarily holding them so are you going to experiment with crypto derivatives or are you gonna stick with the good old huddling on for dear life tactic well we'd love to hear your thoughts on this so let us know in the comments and as always remember to like subscribe and follow us on all our socials for future

Pnu_-9oxT8k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnu_-9oxT8k,"In the last few weeks TRON and USDD stand as 
some of the most searched and talked about topics   worldwide. So if you are wondering 
why TRON is getting so much attention,   this video will help you understand what TRON 
(TRX) is and why people are excited about it. Hey there, in this video I'm going to talk about 
TRON. Now if you're like me and you've been   hearing a lot about it lately but you're not quite 
sure what it is. Don't worry, I'm here to help.   Tron is a blockchain-based operating system 
founded in 2017 by Justin Sun, the CEO of the   Tron Foundation with plans to eventually 
rival Ethereum in terms of functionality. After its acquisition of BitTorrent in 2018, 
Tron's popularity soared to new heights.   So what exactly is TRON, the 
blockchain and its mechanism,   the ecosystem around it, its USDD coin and 
why should you care? Let's take a closer look. Before we get too deep into Tron’s mechanics, 
let's first talk about what Tron is. Tron is a decentralized, layer-one 
open-source blockchain-based   operating system that offers 
similar functionality to Ethereum.   These include smart contract functionality, 
a native cryptocurrency called TRX,   and uses the delegated proof-of-stake mechanism 
to achieve consensus on the blockchain. Tron aims at decentralizing the web through 
utilizing smart contracts to allow developers   to create DApps (decentralized applications). 
As their acquisition of BitTorrent suggests,   the Tron network has a focus 
on media and entertainment. At the time of writing, the Tron network 
had garnered over 97 million accounts   and had facilitated 3.3 billion transactions. 
It currently ranks 14th place among the   world’s top cryptocurrencies in terms of 
market capitalization. The TRX token is   also listed on most major exchanges 
such as Binance, FTX, and Kraken, So, how does Tron work?
Tron works through a decentralized   system. This means that no single entity 
controls all of Tron's activity. Instead,   the blockchain employs a proof-of-stake 
model to achieve network consensus. Tron's infrastructure makes use of smart contracts 
to enable developers to create their own DApps,   as well as coins or tokens, for use on the 
network. Tron's main native token, TRX,   serves as the foundation for these newly created 
tokens. Thereafter, content creators can earn an   income on the network when users directly 
reward their efforts using the TRX token. Currently in the works is a 
network development plan to support   gaming applications. Users would ideally create 
decentralized gaming applications while gamers   directly reward the creators with the 
TRX token when they enjoy their game. Now, let’s see how the TRX token works?  The TRX token is a store of value that can be 
invested in or traded for other cryptocurrencies.   TRX is frequently used by users to create 
and interact with DApps on the Tron network.   You can, however, lock away some 
of your TRX tokens to gain power,   bandwidth, and energy. The more 'Tron Power' you 
have for a longer period of time, the more likely   you are to achieve higher status and have voting 
rights on the Tron blockchain network. Meanwhile,   bandwidth and energy is used for transferring 
assets and running smart contracts on Tron. So what are some of Tron’s features?? Tron has a lot of things to offer that 
got people interested. For starters,   it offers feeless network transactions up to a 
certain limit which is renewed every 24 hours.   That's right - no more expensive 
transaction fees eating into your profits. In today's crypto world, high gas fees 
are an unpleasant experience. However,   with Tron, users can enjoy up to 2000 rapid and 
feeless transactions per second! Compared to   Ethereum’s, 25 transactions per second, and 
Bitcoin’s, 3 to 6 transactions per second,   this is no small feat to achieve! With the 
high scalability and smart contract-based   functionality of the network, developers have a 
plethora of options for developing their apps. Like other smart contract platforms, the Tron 
network also allows for the creation of DApps   (decentralized apps), but has a particular 
focus on developing a creator economy. As we move towards a decentralized web3 internet, 
Tron’s rapid, feeless transactions combined with   an open-source network for developing DApps 
helps bring this vision a lot closer to home. Lastly, Tron directly supports 
content creators and their work.  This means that if you're a content creator,   you can earn rewards for your 
work on the Tron network. This is important because it allows 
content creators to monetize their content   without having to worry about third-party 
intermediaries like Youtube, iTunes and Spotify. Users on the decentralized network can 
directly compensate artists in TRX tokens   or other newly created tokens backed by TRX. Most recently, Tron also launched an algorithmic 
stablecoin, USDD, similar to Terra’s UST,   which is the main source of the recent hype around 
Tron. We’ll get more into USDD in a little while.  Tron Integrations / partnerships
While many blockchains offer smart   contract functionality, Tron does have some 
interesting partnerships under its belt.
   Samsung, for instance, is 
releasing new phone models   that include access to Tron DApps via 
the Samsung app store. This is a giant   tech manufacturer that further exposes 
Tron to larger markets around the world. Metal Pay, an online payment service, has TRX 
tokens integrated into their website and app,   where users can buy the 
tokens more easily with cash. Refereum, on the other hand, allows gamers 
to earn TRX through streaming and viewership. There are many other institutions adopting 
Tron’s use cases, thus bringing to light the   huge potential Tron, and other blockchains, 
could have on a decentralized internet.  What is the USDD coin? On May 5, the Tron network launched 
a new algorithmic stablecoin,   USDD whose value is meant to be pegged 
to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio. The algorithm behind USDD is similar to 
the one of UST-LUNA, using the arbitrage   opportunities between TRX and USDD to maintain 
its peg. When USDD’s price is lower than 1 USD,   users and arbitrageurs can send 1 USDD to 
the system and receive 1 USD worth of TRX.   When USDD’s price is higher than 1 USD,   users and arbitrageurs can send 1 USD worth of TRX 
to the decentralized system and receive 1 USDD. You've probably heard about Terra's 
massive cryptocurrency scandal,   where their UST stablecoin sharply 
fell below the $1 peg in May 2021,   leading to the downfall of the Terra 
blockchain and their native LUNA token. To prevent this from happening   Tron’s CEO Sun, announced that they 
are over-collateralizing the USDD. According to the TRON DAO's website, 
USDD currently has a circulating supply   of about $723.3 million, and purportedly has a 
collateralization ratio of 279.79%. It is worth   noting that this figure includes the TRX burnt to 
mint USDD, as well as TRX itself in its reserves. At the time of writing, Tron's DAO 
has reserves worth $815.5 million.   That includes approximately 14,040.6 BTC 
($423.3 million), around 1.9 billion Tron   ($152 million) and 140 million USDT 
($240 million), which is intended to   be used to defend USDD’s peg in the case 
the algorithmic pegging mechanism fails.
   At the time of writing, USDD is 
slightly off-peg, trading at $0.98  Outro
Having to go through   third party organizations like Youtube, Facebook, 
and Instagram has been a major challenge for   the content creation industry. Especially since 
these third party organizations take up a large   portion of the profit, leaving content creators 
with little compensation for their efforts. While other blockchains have been addressing 
this issue for some time, Tron is the most   popular blockchain that is focusing all of its 
efforts on digital content sharing. Through Tron,   users directly pay artists in digital assets via 
their native token, TRX, which can be exchanged   for other popular cryptocurrencies like USDD, 
bitcoin, and eventually traded for actual cash. However, generally speaking, when 
interacting with decentralized applications,   you should always proceed cautiously 
and always do your own research. And that wraps it up for what you should 
know about Tron and its ecosystem! Will   you be investing in TRX anytime soon? 
We’d love to know what your thoughts   are! Remember to like, subscribe and turn on 
the notifications for future alpha! See ya!",Youtube video,"What Is TRON? TRX, USDD Coin Explained In 2022",2022-06-29 00:00:00,581.0,CoinGecko
SAloPHYh7Xw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAloPHYh7Xw,hardware wallets are the best way to store your cryptocurrency and today i'm going to show you why well if you're like me you want to make sure that your cryptocurrency is stored in a safe and secure place and that is where hardware wallets come in they are specially designed devices that allow you to store your private key offline so that they are not exposed to hacks and cyber attacks well in this video i'm going to show you how they work how you can use them to protect your investments and compare some of the best hardware wallets out there all right let's get started okay so let's first understand crypto wallets in general so from the onset of the crypto space we have been experiencing cases of people losing money on popular exchange platforms from hacking with the latest case targeting the most popular play to earn game axi infinity in the attack which stands as the second biggest attack in history the hackers made a way with 600 million from the ronin network a blockchain network that runs the gaming platform axi infinity now these cases of crypto theft resulted in companies pushing for more secure and safer ways of transacting in crypto and thus came crypto wallets so what are crypto wallets well crypto wallets can be thought of as digital wallets similar to the leather wallets that we carry in our pockets that have cards and cash but with the main difference being that in crypto wallets you store your passcodes to crypto you have in a particular blockchain now crypto wallets can be software based like online wallets or mobile wallets so for example garda wallet exitus wallet metamask coinbase wallet and trust wallet and etc or they can be hardware based like usb devices or physical cards now hardware wallets are the most secure type of crypto wallet as they are not connected to the internet and therefore they are less likely to be compromised by hackers so what makes hardware wallets safe well you may ask yourself if my cryptocurrencies are stored on the blockchain won't my crypto hardware wallet need to connect to the internet to access the blockchain well hardware wallets are safe because they keep your private key offline and away from potential hackers now let's take a closer look at how they do this so first it's important to understand that in order to make a blockchain transaction you need to have your private key this is what allows you to sign the transaction and essentially prove that you are the owner of the crypto funds being sent now if your private key was stored on your computer or online somewhere it would be relatively easy for a hacker to access it and use it to make unauthorized transactions so this is why hardware wallets are so important they keep your private key offline and away from potential hackers so then that's great but what if my crypto hardware wallet is lost or stolen well in addition to storing your private key offline crypto hardware wallets often also incorporate extra layers of security like lock pins two factor authentication biometric locks and something called a seed phrase so the seed phrase is really important if someone discovers your seed phrase they will have access to your cryptocurrency so it's extremely critical to write down your seed phrase which would generally be like 12 unique words and keep it somewhere safe if your hardware wallet is lost or stolen you will use the same seed phrase to regenerate your private key so always keep your seat phrases safe offline and on hard copy so let's talk about some of the best crypto hardware wallets so there are many different types of crypto hardware wallets out there on the market so the ledger crypto wallet is the most popular crypto hardware wallet provider offering the ledger nano x the ledger nano s and the ledger nano s plus wallets so these devices are roughly the size of a thumb drive with their own operating system called the blockchain open ledger operating system now at the moment their flagship model ledger nano x has a competitive cryptocurrency compatibility of more than 5 500 cryptocurrencies and tokens in one place you can install up to 100 applications including popular assets like bitcoin ethereum and xrp ledger offers a ledger live mobile app and a high level of security with its secure element chip used to store cryptographic data now its unique features include optional bluetooth connectivity usb connectivity a clear oled display screen interface and two navigation buttons for confirming transactions now on the downside it's quite a small thumb drive size device which can have you squinting at the no touch screen it isn't very pleasant when proofreading transaction details for example or when there are additional requirements steps for installing each crypto app you need okay let's move on to trezor so currently supporting 1946 coins and tokens trezor is another well-known hardware wallet that offers the trezor one and the trezor model t models so as opposed to ledger where you enter your pin on the device itself trezor utilizes your computer screen as a web interface for pin inputs and other functionalities now while this provides a more comfortable ease of use experience on a larger screen it does introduce security vulnerabilities due to using a computer that is internet enabled so their flagship treasure model t device is small enough to fit nicely on your palm it has a display touchscreen to confirm transactions it has an sd card it also supports shamir's secret sharing method to keep key secure but it lacks bluetooth connectivity now at the moment trezor doesn't have a mobile app but it does come with an android app trezor suite which allows you to do transactions on your smartphone's chrome browser now the tracer model t currently sells for about 310 dollars directly from the manufacturer okay then next the grid plus lattice one model stands out with a larger touchscreen so no more squinting or multitasking pin inputs with your computer now at the moment the hardware wallet only supports bitcoin and ethereum now the device comes with one safe card that looks like a traditional credit or debit card now the card is what stores your pin protected private key and it's a pretty cool concept because you can always carry the card around to transact with a designated shops provided that they have the grid plus device the larger touchscreen interface also provides easier readability while you're going through transaction messages the only caveat is having to buy another safe card if you need to make multiple backups or create many wallets so the grid plus lattice one currently goes for 397 dollars directly from the manufacturer then finally we've got safe pal with the safe pal s1 crypto hardware wallet so this hardware wallet was made with the intent of introducing a more affordable hardware wallet it supports 20 blockchains and more than 10 000 coins and tokens it also syncs with a safe pal mobile app where you can use qr codes to scan transactions on your phone using the card's inbuilt camera now additionally it offers a mnemonic card for storing passcodes and private keys as well as providing a usb connection its control buttons allow you to interact with the display screen now on the flip side though safe pal does not connect to wi-fi nfc or bluetooth it also self-destructs in case of any malfunction so it's very important to make sure that you save your seed phrases in hard copy when using this wallet you can get the safe pal one directly from the manufacturer at about 50 and there you have it the four best crypto hardware wallets now no matter which crypto hardware wallet you choose you can be rest assured that your coins will be safe and sound hardware wallets are the best way to store cryptocurrency and they are an essential part of any crypto investors toolkit however while crypto hardware wallets are considered to be a safe and secure way to store your cryptocurrency there are still some potential risks associated with them now one of the biggest risks is that if you lose your seed phrase you will also lose access to your crypto so again it's important to make sure that you have a backup of your seed phrase somewhere safe like writing it on paper what is called a paper wallet now another potential risk is that crypto hardware wallets can be susceptible to phishing attacks in which scammers try to trick you into revealing your private key or seed phrase now you can avoid phishing attacks by only downloading crypto hardware wallet software only from official sources and not blindly signing transactions and then additionally also crypto hardware wallets can be vulnerable to wrench attacks in which malicious people use physical force or threats on you so that you give them your wallet and passcode so you might want to think twice before flaunting your shiny new hardware wallet around so which crypto hardware wallet stood out the most to you well we'd love to know what your thoughts are in the comments below also remember to like subscribe and turn on the

SGyc0e7AKqI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGyc0e7AKqI,you're probably wondering what polka dot is and why you should care in today's world there are a ton of blockchain technologies spinning up on the market all of these technologies from bitcoin to ethereum to polka dot have something to offer in this video we're going to explain the basics of polka dot and its ecosystem how different it is from its blockchain counterparts and the benefits polkadot brings to the crypto market space let's get started so what is polka dot as the name implies the polka dot blockchain is like the polka dot fabric itself except with interconnections between the polka dots commonly referred to as the internet of blockchains polkadot is a multi-chain of many blockchains called parachains with interconnections between them that allow them to function as one collective unit why is polka dot important you may be wondering why go through the trouble of sinking many blockchains into one to address this question let's go back in time to the earliest blockchains we were excited about the decentralization aspect of it most people were drawn to the idea of not having to go through banks governments and other organizations to make transactions however with the benefits of eliminating the middleman came the greatest obstacle for blockchains speed and scalability both bitcoin and ethereum are simply too slow and can only process a limited number of transactions per second not to mention the high gas fee users have to pay for their transactions to go through furthermore due to the use of the proof-of-work model these blockchains consume a significant amount of electrical energy to solve this issue ethereum proposed a newly improved ethereum 2.0 that promises increased scalability security and sustainability but with ethereum 2.0 still underway polka dot couldn't wait but to solve these issues themselves polka dot is completely reinventing the original blockchain's architecture to solve the scalability and performance issues that users are experiencing their goal is to redefine the independence of blockchain applications to allow for inter-blockchain transactions of any type of data assets or tokens what is polka dot exactly polka dot is a layer zero open source blockchain platform and cryptocurrency that allows multiple blockchains to connect and operate within itself in essence bridges allow parachains and parathreads to communicate with external networks like bitcoin and ethereum thereby further expanding the interoperability of the polka dot blockchain it's the first ever project of its kind that brings all of the previous blockchains on one platform along with newer blockchains this is why some people refer to polkadot as the internet of blockchains what is the polkadot ecosystem the easiest way to think about the polkadot ecosystem is through the internet and how it works nowadays you can do lots of things on the internet from gaming to e-commerce to e-learning the possibilities of maximizing the internet for everyday use are insurmountable with web 3.0 it's now possible to integrate blockchain capabilities into the internet this is what has made decentralized applications or d apps an internet sensation of the 21st century but to effectively maximize blockchain capabilities on the internet there needs to be some kind of interconnection between different types of blockchains this way users can make use of a variety of services from different blockchains at the same time so how does polkadot work in the polkadot ecosystem the underlying central chain of the polkadot ecosystem is called a relay chain while the non-native block chains running on top of the underlying network are called parachains the relay chain is like the backbone of polka dot's ecosystem and it helps keep the pair chains in sync with each other using a proof of stake consensus model there are no limits to the blockchains that can be added to the platform from private chains to public chains oracles to future blockchain technologies that are yet to be created in fact polkadot provides a primary blockchain software development toolkit sdk called the substrate that allows developers to create their own pair of chains to operate on the polka dot network however before adding the blockchain on polka dot a testing development blockchain platform called kusama is used to conduct parachain slot auctions these auctions are driven by validators and would determine which parachain eventually launches on polkadot to participate in the auctions as a validator you need to have polka dots native dot token the token is also used to validate transactions on polka dots and is what contributes to the staking governance and evolution of the project the project that offers the most dot before the auction ends wins the slot projects can bid for a slot using their own dot or through a crowd loan a crowd loan also known as a parachain loan offering plo is a way for a project to raise dot from its community and investors to bid for a pair chain slot what are the benefits of polka dot the polka dot ecosystem comes with a number of benefits polka dots main attractive feature is interoperability the platform is the first blockchain to allow interoperability between other blockchains in a manner that we've never seen before sure blockchains provide a trustless way to make transactions but with each blockchain working solely we're bound to have leading giants of the market a select few companies having control over the market space in essence the drive to make sure users have complete control over their data and identity is what sparked great interest in the idea of building decentralized applications on the web 3.0 platform combined with the polka dot ecosystem and the use of parachains users can access a variety of decentralized services all from the same network furthermore the para chains are validated on the relay chain parallel to one another thus creating the immense potential for scalability polka dot also offers enhanced security provides a high level of security for the entire network ensuring they are robust from attacks another benefit of polka dot is its ability to escalate the process of developing an entirely new blockchain using polka dot substrate sdk tool developers can quickly create new blockchains for specific use cases moreover developers can utilize the technologies of existing parachains on the network say for instance you have a blockchain that needs to have smart contract capabilities instead of developing the technology from scratch a process that could take months or years depending on the resources available to you polka dot allows you to utilize the same smart contract functionality from existing parachains on the network there's also another perk to future-proof blockchains such that in the future you'd have future-proof functionality where your system upgrades itself as blockchain technology rapidly increases polka dot is undeniably a one-of-a-kind blockchain ecosystem even when gavin the co-founder of ethereum left the project to launch polka dots many developers and users around the world jumped on along with him for the overwhelming potential a multi-chain blockchain could bring with its scalability interoperability and security features polka dot is well positioned to become the backbone of the decentralized internet who knows it just might be the key to mass adoption of crypto in the future and that wraps it up for what you

ZryGHdbrrVA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZryGHdbrrVA,these days nft games are available in all manner of styles and genres so deciding what you want to play can be a little bit difficult from sprawling rpgs to simple idol games deciding what to play can be a problem so we already made one video about this which you can watch right here but it seems that one video wasn't enough to fit everything this year has to offer so here is another 10 nft games you can play in 2022. okay first up play crypto raiders if you have an iron will and can stomach hardcore old-school dungeon crawlers crypto raiders is an nft p2e game on polygon that has caused a lot of buzz can you imagine yourself raiding dungeons conquering enemies and earning loot before returning to your homeland victorious well that's what crypto raiders is a utility-based nft reminiscent of olden days zelda games dungeons release weekly so you have a healthy balance between evergreen dungeons that you can continuously raid and limited time dungeons that you can only raid a few times before it closes when a character completes a dungeon you will get to take one out of three loot options once you select your choice your character will get sent back with that piece of loot however if a character dies in battle the character nft will be unusable for future dungeon raids but at least you'll have a memory of your fallen raider now as characters die in these dungeon raids it will increase the value of base characters as people will have to buy another one to keep playing now because death in the game is permanent you'll need to be strategic and weigh your options before entering a given dungeon okay next up trevor so this game seems to capture the essence of two games the fast world of runescape sprinkled with the tranquil setting of stardew valley this fantasy sci-fi massively multiplayer online role-playing game or mmorpg incorporates the combat from moba games like league of legends from slaying beasts forging mighty weapons forming guilds defeating dungeons and exploring the deep lore the living world of drivers awaits those daring enough to conquer it the rewards are earned as players play the game buyers purchase land plots and get access to a private home that they can decorate and customize to their liking now later in development players can combine more than one founder's plot to create a larger space though focused on building a solid social system the triverse team also has plans for pets npcs and in-game marketplace seasonal events and more you can purchase nf trees and founders plots on openc though don't expect to pay the original sale price okay for all the millennials out there do you remember tamagotchi well play avegachi if you've always wanted to do more than just feeding and petting your resource leeching tamagotchi so the avigachi game has defy elements and earning money while playing avigachi is a simple and entertaining process the game is stimulating and addictive in the game five genre it allows you to possess pixel ghosts which are also nfts each avigachi is also charged with a tokens from ave which are yield bearing tokens that means that your abigails are passive money making machines your casters or ghosts value is also determined by how rare they are the essence of avigachi is that you will possess collectible ghosts all of which have unique qualities you can also participate in rarity farming and earn money from selling your rare avigachis play frontier if you enjoy outwitting and outplaying opponents in competitive games such as xcom frontier is a p2e play to earn and pvp player versus player augmented reality based online battle game developed by the watch it is a game fight project based on the story of the watcher sn404 a mystical character lost in space due to an obscure incident this nft game started out with 3 000 black box nfts each black box in the frontier game nft collection has a unique data key to redeem data the prime in-game erc 20 utility token all entities holding the black box on a specific date would have received the data key then play neon heroes if you like the idea of cosplaying as a cat piloting gundam robots in overwatch neon heroes is a play to earn nft metaverse game that allows players to collect their own neon cat heroes and guardian robots and battle other players in a shooter style action game players can collect rare weapons and skins and trade them as nfts in the in games unique marketplace as well as control guardian mechs with brave neon heroes piloting them in pve and pvp battles the nym token is the game's main currency while its utility token is ctnp or catnip players can use these in-game tokens to level up characters and weapons craft nft items and modify land plots the token can also be used in the marketplace for trading activities with other players and if you're wondering neon heroes is free to play okay next up we've got phantom galaxies now play this game if you prefer transformers to guns and cats now the game is action-packed showcasing stellar voice acting and cutscenes throughout the primary story mode currently we have two star fighters available an assault unit and a buster unit or if you like to take things slower there are plenty of side missions for you to complete multiplayer is a big part of phantom galaxies you can join guilds battling for land and resources with other players you can also compete in pvp arena modes battling it out for resources and exp your playable characters starfighters are leveled up by completing tasks while also being able to make your own be aware however you must maintain your character's health this makes the game more strategic setting good players apart now during gameplay players participate in quests operations raids and more the further from the core the more dangerous the missions and the better the loot you go far enough and you enter the rogue sectors here players compete against each other to gain control of various bases and resource points once captured players deposit governance tokens into their holdings and earn a steady stream of rewards as long as they remain in control play big time if controlling a time traveling kratos with your friends sounds like an excellent way to spend your time big time is an nft role-playing game

xS0PyYpt6bA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS0PyYpt6bA,you've seen one of these things before right yeah it's a bridge so you know that bridges connect to physical locations and facilitate movements between them okay now replace that bridge with a blockchain bridge connecting two different blockchains and you will have the basics of blockchain bridges down and now that the blockchains are connected the transfer of tokens and data between them is now possible so let's find out why we need blockchain bridges how they work and the different types of bridges that are available also stick to the end of the video to find out one of the biggest highs in the history of cryptocurrency which involved a blockchain bridge all right let's begin okay so let's start by finding out why we need blockchain bridges in the first place so ever since new blockchains started popping up after the creation of bitcoin's blockchain in 2008 there has been a prevailing problem and that is a lack of interoperability so there's always been a need to solve this problem to ideally make the whole crypto ecosystem work as a team instead of existing like islands and having the ability to move your assets to different blockchains means that you get to enjoy the benefits that may be native to certain ecosystems so let's have a look at some of these benefits okay so the first benefit is that you may be able to enjoy cheaper and faster transactions so let's say you have eth on the ethereum network which has its own flaws like high transaction fees and slow throughputs so you could choose to move your assets through a bridge to polygon which is much faster and also cheaper so by moving your eth to polygon you get to save money by trading tokens for a fraction of the cost you would incur on the ethereum network so the second benefit that comes with blockchain bridges is the ability to explore the blockchain ecosystem because this allows you to enjoy products like decentralized applications or dapps that only exist on other blockchains so for example orca is a d5 protocol that is only available on solana and supports a wrapped version of eth you can watch this video right here where we explain how rap tokens work but essentially tokens are wrapped to allow them to work in a different ecosystem okay so back to our example so if you find interest rates or products offered in the orca protocol appealing you may decide to port your eth to solana through a bridge to enjoy the benefits offered by the protocol and this could also be the case for protocols that exist on multiple blockchains like the popular lending protocol ave so say you've been using ave on ethereum to land usct but notice that the interest for the same coin on polygon is higher well then you may choose to move your assets to polygon and take advantage of the higher interest there okay so then another benefit has to do with scalability just like users developers that create products on the ethereum network have had negative experiences due to the fees and speed so you might ask well why do they choose to build there in the first place well since ethereum has been there for a longer time than its competitors there is a factor of network effects this is when a product in this case ethereum becomes more valuable when more people use it and many people using it there comes liquidity which is a measure of how easy it is to convert one asset to another but now with blockchain bridges developers don't have to trade off these important benefits for speed and lower transaction costs by building on a different chain as users can easily move their assets from the original chain to other block chains where the same tokens can be processed faster and at a lower cost okay so those are the benefits so let's go a little bit deeper and find out how block chains actually work so let's take a practical example say maureen has her assets on ethereum but she wants to try out soland a lending and borrowing platform on solana so maureen will need to transfer her eath to solana through a bridge so the bridge may lock the three eth on ethereum and mint new ones that can run on solana so as you can see the total number of circulating eats remains constant because while the three eats will still be on ethereum they will be locked so that the equivalent number of eats will be available for marine on solana now after some time if maureen wants her original eath back through the bridge she will burn her salon compatible each to release her locked ease so now that you have the full picture of the whole process you'll notice that the e isn't actually moving right it rather it gets locked and you get access to a similar amount that is compatible with another chain now also while different bridges have similar functions what happens in the background might differ depending on the mechanism they use now the example that i've covered is one of the few mechanisms bridges use though generally bridges can either be centralized commonly known as trust-based or decentralized commonly known as trustless okay so let's start with trust-based bridges as the name suggests you are essentially trusting your crypto in the hands of a centralized entity so you have to give up control of your assets as they act as third parties that verify transactions and convert your coins into another cryptocurrency so you must have encountered wbtc or wrapped btc before so basically it is a product of a centralized entity that takes btc and wraps it in an erc20 contract to make it function like an ethereum token so the advantage of using trust base bridges is that they are cheaper and quicker now on the other hand we also have trustless bridges which depend on algorithms to operate thereby removing the need for a third party so they are decentralized just like blockchain with individual networks contributing to the validation of transactions however being decentralized has its own flaws one of them is that the service may be freelance based so basically the validators are paid to only process your transaction so in case of a problem they may not be of any help to you okay so then on to the big question are blockchain bridges safe well look it's important to know that when it comes to crypto your capital may always be at risk and bridges they're just no exception especially since successful attacks on blockchain bridges have become unfortunately a common occurrence but let's talk about the biggest cryptocurrency theft of all time that involves a raid on the ronin network bridge which is an exchange that allows axey infinity video game players to exchange their in-game tokens for other cryptocurrencies so what happened was the attackers stole the private keys required to authenticate transactions and transferred assets worth 614 million at the time to their own wallet the second biggest heist which occurred in 2021 also involved a blockchain bridge where the attacker stole assets worth 611 million which he later returned and you'll never guess the reason he gave for the successful hack he said that the hack was just for fun and he was just keeping the assets safe in his personal wallet well there are other multiple hacks as well so there is a clear problem here that needs to be addressed unfortunately but apart from the downsides blockchain bridges bring interoperability an important factor in driving blockchain technology forward so allowing different terms and blockchain protocols in the space to work together will fuel innovation which will in turn accelerate user adoption well let us know in the comments if you've used a blockchain bridge before and your thoughts on the technology well remember

rj7-sE6H-Hs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj7-sE6H-Hs,as more and more people sign up for cryptocurrency the network becomes increasingly strained ethereum as the market leader is in a scalability crisis but it appears that we may not have to wait much longer for lower transaction fees with layer 2 solutions it's likely the ethereum platform success is well begun but what exactly are these layer 2 projects and how do they work in this video we'll go over these topics and more let's get started why do we need layer 2 solutions you've probably heard about the high gas fees that ethereum users must pay to make transactions on the network with the overwhelming transaction volume on ethereum it's becoming a who can afford to pay system for your transactions to go through faster than other users on the network today users might have to pay several hundred dollars just to complete a single network transaction during the recent other deeds land sale gas spiked to as high as 8 000 gray and users had to pay over 2 eth just for transaction fees it's no secret that high gas fees are causing a major scaling crisis for ethereum firstly they must find a way to accommodate millions if not hundreds of millions of people in the future also they need to run more transactions per second currently ethereum's capacity cannot allow it to perform large numbers of transactions per second most importantly ethereum needs to maintain the network security and high level of decentralization so how can ethereum sustain blockchain scalability security and decentralization trillium so that the entire system does not collapse enter layer 2 solutions although ethereum plans to release several updates in the coming years its layer 2 solutions appear to assure users of the platform's future success layer two solutions are a way for ethereum to scale blockchains before layer two solutions ethereum ran the blockchain in a monolithic manner this means that everything was done on the blockchain itself from transaction processing to security protocols to data integrity however ethereum is currently adopting a modular approach that makes use of a multi-layer system so rather than handling everything on its own the blockchain delegates some of the work to other layers of the network so in this case layer 2 operates on top of ethereum which is also referred to as a layer 1 block chain other layer ones you may use are bitcoin solana binance smart chain and more how do layer twos work layer two solutions usually execute transactions outside of their underlying network once done they send back compressed forms of the transactions back to the network in this way layer two performs the execution part while layer one performs the security and final data storage many layer twos can run simultaneously on top of ethereum this means that you can have a much higher number of transactions running per second layer 2 scaling solutions send compressed forms of the transactions back to ethereum on a regular basis in turn ethereum assures the transaction's security and decentralization because no modifications are required on layer 1 all layer 2 does is take over the transactional burden from layer 1. in this way ethereum becomes less congested and the blockchain becomes more scalable as a result ethereum can be scaled up in the future it will also be fast while retaining the blockchain security and integrity the most exciting layer 2 solutions since many layer 2s can run simultaneously on top of ethereum many projects have emerged over these last few months each new layer 2 solution will often tweak the code of its predecessor to boost efficiency the most exciting of which are arbitrary optimism zk sync stark net and metas these projects generally fall under two categories optimistic roll ups and zk roll ups let's look at how these projects differ from one another optimistic layer two roll-ups there are three major types of optimistic roll-ups optimism and arbitrary and menace the optimism project is the preceding layer 2 solution which uses single round fraud proofs and relies on layer 1 to execute layer 2 transactions as a result the fraud proof verification process is instant but it incurs extra gas fees due to its reliance on on-chain layer 1 execution processes arbitram on the other hand saw this problem and tweaked optimism source code to implement multi-round fraud proofs this way transactions are not entirely executed on layer 1. lastly there's metas a hard fork project of optimism that offers a higher level of decentralization it does this using multiple sequencers as opposed to one as optimism does it also uses its own virtual machine called the metis virtual machine mvm since the menace launch there has been a lot of excitement and increasing interest around the project particularly because it uniquely uses its own token medisdow why are they called optimistic rollups these three rollups are known as optimistic rollups because they employ an honor system in which the smart contract on layer one does not validate that layer two's state changes were done correctly furthermore optimism and arbitrim do not have their own tokens they instead use raft eath which has a one to one ratio with the eth token as a result they both have cross-chain erc 20 token compatibility we also have zero knowledge roll ups zk roll ups like zk sync and stark net they are also tokenless and perform similar to optimistic roll-ups in that they compress large off-chain transactions and submit them as a single transaction onto ethereum the main difference is that ethereum's smart contracts won't take the off chain transaction in good faith instead zk roll ups require a zero knowledge cryptographic proof that all the transactions were carried out correctly in the end each batch of transactions will have its own validity proof sent to ethereum optimistic roll-ups may have more disputes on the validity of the transactions more disputes could mean significantly longer withdrawal periods compared to zk roll ups on the flip side optimistic roll-ups provide significant scalability gains since they do not need to perform additional computation by default what is the best layer 2 solution layer 2 significantly lower gas fees and help scale ethereum to accommodate more transactions per second however users seem to favor arbitram over other layer 2 solutions in fact arbitrarum is the leading solution of all other layer 2 projects with the most users and the highest billion total value locked tvl in smart contracts currently users prefer arbitram for ethereum scaling arbitram has lower gas fees and an automatic arbitram virtual machine avm to ethereum virtual machine evm translation which encourages d-apps to go with arbitram for its total control over executing smart contracts as far as the future of ethereum goes layer 2 technologies are looking bright for the market leader hopefully these projects continue to solve the congestion issues and high gas fees that users currently have to pay to use the platform subscribe to coin gecko and turn on your notifications for future alpha see ya

tbupOnYIk0o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbupOnYIk0o,okay let's be real when buying stocks and cryptocurrencies most of us whether accredited investors or regular players were in it for the gains however as long as those profits remain unrealized our assets will be subject to the whims of the market and when the pull backs occur which are more often in the crypto market the majority if not all of your profits could easily be wiped out but what if you could cut your losses in half or even keep the gains that you've already made well there are several methods for doing so but they are collectively known as hedging so hedging is a great way to reduce the risk of negative market swings either by limiting your earnings or losses well in this video let's take a deeper look at these tactics and how these instruments have grown into more than just an insurance policy but also a vehicle for earning yield independent of market conditions the old saying do not put all your eggs in one basket applies here so if puts calls and other financial instruments are too complicated for you right now there are far simpler kinds of hedging such as diversification which is also the most accessible hedging method for smaller investors while minimum purchase restrictions and administrative costs can make investing in multiple asset classes expensive the development of decentralized synthetic assets or synths has made it much simpler for regular investors and crypto enthusiasts to join in on the game these derivatives offered by synthetics for instance are designed to mimic the price swings of the underlying asset and may be acquired in fractions through decentralized exchanges so you can diversify by allocating your portfolio to various asset classes that are poorly linked or even inversely correlated with each other for example if you held some safer assets rather than a totally risk-on strategy the relative stability of these safe assets would help reduce some of the losses you would have experienced if you had a portfolio of exclusively risk on assets during a downturn now while diversification is a more basic idea for most investors to grasp quantifying how well your risk exposures are hedge may be tough certain derivatives such as options are preferable for a more quantitative approach to hedging these instruments receive their value from an underlying asset their value will undoubtedly change in response to the price of that asset so call options enable you to purchase and put options allow you to sell an asset at a preset price referred to as a strike price within a certain time frame options have gained popularity as a cheaper way to receive leverage without having to buy the physical asset thanks to popular trading sites like robinhood the majority of individuals however are unaware that their primary objective was risk management okay so for a more specific example suppose that you bought 10 ethereum for 2500 and after a long time of huddling your stock is now worth 2 900 a sixteen percent increase despite the fact that ethereum may hit a new all-time high in the future you may be frightened that your hard-earned profits may be quickly depleted so to protect yourself you may buy ten ethereum put options with a strike price of twenty nine hundred dollars for eight sixty five each now let's assume two scenarios keep ethereum over twenty nine keep it below 2 900. if the price of ethereum stays the same or rises until your options expire you will only lose the money you bought for the options which is 86.50 however if the price of ethereum goes below 2900 during that time you have the choice to either exercise the options to ensure that your ethereum may still be sold for 2900 or sell the options since they are now valued open derebit siren and premia are just a few of the many platforms available in the crypto sector for purchasing options if you want to employ options as part of your hedging strategy these platforms each have their own list of options to pick from each with varying pricing expiration dates and fees so be sure to check them all out now futures and perpetual contracts similar to options can provide downside protection the main distinction is that unlike options both parties must fulfill the futures contract when it matures whereas option holders are not required to exercise their option so what are futurist contracts so futures contracts are standardized agreements to buy or sell a certain asset at a specific future date perpetual contracts on the other hand do not have an expiration date as the name suggests so ethereum holders may follow the same strategy by keeping their spot positions while creating a short position at their target price using either futures or perpetual contracts as in the previous example so assume a short trade in ethereum was launched at 2 900 if ethereum falls below that price the gains from your short position will cover the loss and value of your holdings and vice versa before any fees are deducted and aside from that you'll need to keep a watch on futures contract expiry days you must sell the contract before it matures or roll it over if you do not plan to execute it when you roll a futures contract you are effectively prolonging the settlement term by closing the old contract and starting a new one allowing you to remain protected until the next maturity date in either case these contracts are mostly reserved for well-known cryptocurrencies that are extensively traded on controlled exchanges long-tail assets are more difficult to hedge in this matter since most exchanges do not support their derivatives owing to a lack of liquidity decentralized perpetual platforms such as dydx or drift protocol might nonetheless prove to be a feasible option for exotic acid derivatives now due to the volatility of the crypto world mastering the art of profit retention is equally as crucial as mastering the art of profit generation to begin hedging you don't need to be too technical or have an extensive financial background anyone could use device capabilities to access and execute various hedging methods on their own now we should anticipate seeing a greater selection of supported assets as the demand for hedging grows in popularity within the broader crypto community and also the adaptability of d5's multiple lego parts might possibly simplify more complex hedging techniques for the general public however this is merely the beginning and much more work has to be done before this fledgling sector of the

joMxPoYgyvA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joMxPoYgyvA,hi i'm yusef and in this video let's talk about chain link so the end of 2018 not a great year for many projects many projects died or shriveled over the lengthy crypto season of december 2018 yet chain link managed to develop and even defy the gloomy market so how did chain link manage to develop during a time when the crypto market was crashing and stagnating well cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies have emerged from the shadows of uncertainty and into the public eye the emergence of new forms of crypto assets as well as ongoing innovations in the crypto fields such as d5 and nft have enhanced crypto's reputation chain link on the other hand has become a household brand as one of the fundamental components for blockchain applications but how well let's take a look so chain link is a decentralized oracle network that feeds a stream of data to smart contracts running on several blockchains so then what is its goal well its goal is to make smart contracts even more powerful by allowing them to use variable data from other sources the blockchain's inability to retrieve trustworthy information from the real world was meant to be solved by this oracle network which was expected to tackle one of the main obstacles to the practical implementation of smart contracts so let's take a step back let's talk about smart contracts so a smart contract like any other contract defines the condition of a deal however unlike a typical contract the rules of a smart contract are carried out as a code on a network like ethereum so smart contracts let developers create apps that reap the benefits of blockchain security dependability and usability while providing complex peer-to-peer functionality now in the context of blockchain and decentralized finance smart contracts have become more important their implementation contributes to the primary goal of bitcoin and other decentralized networks smart contracts enable users to conduct safe peer-to-peer or p2p transactions and without the need for middlemen like banks or governments now there is no native blockchain in chain link instead it connects to numerous blockchains at the same time supplying them with current data feeds it functions as both an oracle and an oracle aggregator chain link acquires data from a variety of sources and transmits it straight to blockchains and if you're a data supplier you only want to supply reliable data because if you have a low reputation score it will end in your withdrawal from the platform so then how does chain link actually work well although traditional oracles are centralized chain link uses hybrid smart contracts to decentralize the process of transferring data on and off blockchains oracles give the web 3.0 ecosystem a method to connect to existing data sources legacy systems and sophistic calculations decentralized oracle networks enable the implementation of hybrid smart contracts in which on-chain code and off-chain infrastructure are coupled to provide complex decentralized applications that respond to real world events and interact with traditional systems all right so then let's talk about the process so for step one chain link customers must first create a service level agreement or an sla that outlines a set of desirable data criteria the program then matches the user with oracles that can give the data using the sla and after establishing the settings the user uploads the sla and invests their link cryptocurrency in an order matching contract that takes oracle bins so then over to step two which is data reporting so this is where the oracles link to external sources and get the actual data that the sla requires the oracles then process the data before sending it back to chain link blockchain contracts now the final step is to add up the data oracle's collection findings and return them to an aggregation contract the aggregation contract collects the replies and evaluates their validity and gives the user a weighted score based on the total of all of the data received chain link encourages a wide audience to operate nodes on the network and compensates them with its native link currency because it is a decentralized and open source network the node operators allow the oracle network to provide information like price data to blockchains data requests will be handled by several nodes which will make contact with real-world data sources easier they return to the chain-link aggregating contract to compare replies after they have the appropriate data by averaging replies the optimal balance of reliable information is achieved the chain-link notes are responsible for safeguarding and verifying transactions these funds are exchanged on d5 applications and they are crucial for giving data that are updated every second also chain link's collaboration with google allows ethereum blockchain engineers to obtain access to vast volumes of data now the chain link network employs an erc677 token which is based on the erc 20 token standard and allows for data payloads and token transactions it's also used to pay data providers that bring and convert data onto the blockchain and are compensated by the date of buyer when data suppliers or oracle submit bids they set the cost for their services so is there a future for chain link well hey we are no financial advisors nor can we predict the future prices of link i mean we wish but the dispersion of data sources and oracles are two major objectives for ensuring security on the chain link network chain link like other networks aspires to grow by adding more users and operators to increase the network effects and become more resilient and useful what the future holds cannot be known well what are your thoughts on chain link and the link token drop them down in the comments below and let's have a little chat now if you like to stay updated to all things crypto make sure you
