the market and one of the most prevalent forms of scams are rug pools keep watching this video to learn more about what rug pools are how they happen rug pool scams to look out for and tips on how to avoid them let's get started imagine having someone yank a rug out from under you without warning they drag it out forcing you to lose balance along with anything you had on you when it comes to the cryptocurrency world rug pools happen in a similar fashion perhaps you've heard about a new project in town with exponential growth rates the coin's value is skyrocketing from zero to as much as 10 times return on investment in a matter of minutes naturally more people will join the bandwagon in an effort to make some quick cash let's say you decide to give your cryptocurrency investment one more night of growth before withdrawing your large sums of profit so you go to bed as happy as a kite only to discover the next morning that the value of your coin has dropped shockingly to zero the team behind the token sold all their shares dragging the token's price to the ground and the chances of the token prices ever popping up again are pretty slim if any of these instances sound familiar then you've probably fallen victim to a crypto scam called a rug pool how do rug pools happen a rug pool happens when the developers of a hot crypto project suddenly withdraw all of the investors funds and make a run for it since there is no liquidity left to back up the cryptocurrency's value the market price drops significantly often to zero leaving investors with no way of trading their coins and getting their money back rug pools often occur in the world of crypto which allow anyone to create and list new tokens without having them verified as legitimate a popular rug pool is the squid game token rug pool the developers of this project took advantage of the popular squid game netflix show to build market hype around their new squid game token the token will function similarly to the show with players earning squid tokens when they play the squid game the catch was that people would need to invest a certain amount of squid tokens to participate the token's hype grew to soaring heights it amassed a massive social media following and its price skyrocketed from a few cents to nearly three thousand dollars however due to the mechanics built around the token no one could withdraw their money which is a classic case of a honeypot the developers withdrew all of the investors funds crashing the tokens price to almost zero dollars in just about five minutes investors were unable to sell their tokens and even if they could the coin's market value was next to nothing the developers and walked away with an estimated 3.4 million dollars of investors funds what's even more shocking is that 24 hours after the price dipped to zero the coins price shot up by 28 with a trading volume of over 1.2 million dollars which means some investors continue to buy the token how can you tell that a project is a scam let's have a look at the top three scams to watch out for unfortunately cryptocurrency is hardly regulated so it's entirely up to you to stay vigilant to avoid falling victim to any of the scammers out there at the top spot is unlocked liquidity since scammers often rug pull investors funds through withdrawing from the cryptocurrency's liquidity pool you may want to make sure that the project you're investing in has locked liquidity locked liquidity means that the developers of the project cannot withdraw funds from the liquidity pool for a certain period of time it may be locked for a few weeks or a few months some projects lock the liquidity for longer periods of up to 500 years if the liquidity is locked for a longer period of time you can have some satisfaction knowing that there are lower chances of a rug pull next you may want to check whether a few wallets hold an overwhelmingly large amount of the project's total tokens many rug pools have irregular token distribution these wallets are often called whales and they pose the greatest risk to a rug pool if they decide to sell all their tokens all at once thanks to the crypto scene being transparent you can see what wallets hold what to confirm the token distribution of a crypto project go to etherscan which is a popular platform that shows which wallets hold the largest amounts of the total token supply tools such as unicrypt to check if the project has liquidity locked with them remember to also pay attention to the duration of the lock up liquidity locked for a measly one month for instance is as good as being unlocked most crypto projects will take months to years of development on the other hand mosting up new projects pretty fast sometimes launching overnight consequently it's easy to spot a fake crypto project by the publicly available information about the project which brings us to the third red flag to watch out for lack of audits the crypto community constantly performs audits independently that help to verify a project's authenticity in case a crypto project lacks a third party security or financial transparency audit there's a high likelihood the project may be a scam where the contract may allow developers to mint an unlimited amount of tokens or where only certain addresses are able to sell their tokens run now that we've seen three of the most popular scams to watch out for let's look at tips on how to avoid falling victim to rug pools 1. always perform due diligence on a project before investing take advantage of what the crypto community says about the project as well as checking out the project's source code the white paper and the links within the project's website and their social media pages [Music] there are also great online rug pool checker tools you could use to detect rug pool or honeypot crypto projects including bsc scan token sniffer honeypot detector bs checker rug doctor and cryptac two be careful of the fomo effect if you ever feel like you should invest in the cryptocurrency simply because of the fear of missing out don't let it not be the main reason for making a cryptocurrency investment without first performing proper due diligence on the project three watch out for suspiciously growing market prices cryptocurrencies are highly volatile still some tokens can have suspiciously striking growth rates without any valid reason for it when a token spikes up in value and you have no valid way of justifying its growth then you may want to hold off on making that investment four check out the project's social media presence social media is the most notorious driver of rug pools so you may want to keep an eye out for suspicious social media behavior for starters you can check out the project's social media pages for any suspicious follower accounts likes or comments also most rug pools spin up their projects overnight so they spend less time perfecting their websites if a project's website has a fishy overall design faulty links or lacks uniqueness there are high chances the project is fake 5. don't dismiss the red flags we put this tip here because even with the red flags a 10 times return on investment can really tempt you to invest in a project in other instances everyone around you may encourage you to invest in the project despite feeling unsure about it it's crucial to keep in mind that some rug pools can take months or years before they happen during this time it's best to always trust in yourself and know when to walk away rug pools are a crypto scam that take advantage of market demand the popular fomo fear of missing out effect often causes more people to hype up a specific cryptocurrency leading to even more people wanting to invest in what seems to be the next big project on the market unfortunately not all crypto projects are legitimate as some developers choose to gamble with investors funds so it's always crucial to stay vigilant before investing in any project and always make sure to never invest more than you can afford to lose always remember rule number one do your own research and that wraps it up for what you should know

\"one of the most proudly touted features of Bitcoin is its maximum supply of 21 million the reasoning goes that this property makes it similar to limited resources such as gold but what happens when all 21 million Bitcoin are mined first let's do a quick recap of how Bitcoin mining works new Bitcoins enter circulation via a process known as mining this involves users operating powerful computers to solve cryptographic puzzles in order to add blocks of transactions onto the blockchain in return they earn block rewards for their efforts when Bitcoin was just created each block added would earn miners 50 Bitcoin after every 210 000 blocks or roughly every four years a Bitcoin having occurs which slashes rewards by half so far there have been three havings so each block added now earns miners 6.25 Bitcoins the next having is set for some time in April 2024 where the block reward will drop further to 3.125 Bitcoins you can probably see where this goes eventually the block reward will drop to zero as the 21 million Bitcoin limit is aged then what's left to incentivize miners to stay unlike gold which could still continue to be traded without miners Bitcoin miners are essential as they are the ones who validate transactions and secure the network this is where fees come in aside from just the block reward miners also receive all the fees from transactions included in a block paid by the sender the idea is that when block rewards eventually run out ideally adoption of Bitcoin is widespread enough or its price is high enough that fees become a big enough reward for minors to continue to mine blocks however some have questioned the viability for fees alone to act as a sufficient incentive for minors to stay since aside from spikes during bull markets fees have only made up of small percentage of total minor Revenue though recent developments with Bitcoin ordinals has led to skyrocketing fees in the midst of a bear Market this is definitely a boon for miners but it remains to be seen if this will be sustained into the indefinite future another potential income Source could be via participation in demand response programs these incentive programs involve large users of electricity such as Bitcoin miners getting paid for voluntarily pausing operations in order to balance out load on the electrical grid in Texas where wind and solar energy is on the rise miners have earned up to 10 percent of their revenue via these programs which will likely become more common as renewable energy capacity expands speaking of Renewables there will also likely be minors with access to cheap or free electricity that can afford to keep mining even with decreased revenues last but not least there is also the self-interest of Bitcoin holders that we can count on to keep the network functioning we may eventually have major investment funds hold Bitcoin in their portfolio or even countries which adopt it as a reserve currency if and when that happens there will then be powerful and economically invested parties which will be motivated to keep the Bitcoin Network secure by setting up mining operations if needed but what do you think will the Bitcoin Network run fine on fees alone especially with the rise of ordinals if you want to learn more about nfts and tokens on bitcoin check out our video on them right here foreign\"\n        ],\n
