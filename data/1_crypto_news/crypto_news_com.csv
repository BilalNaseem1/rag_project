British fintech company Revolut has started what appears to be a phased introduction of its crypto exchange, Revolut X, as part of its intensified focus on cryptocurrency initiatives.

Based on notifications circulated among a select group of users in the U.K., Revolut has granted access exclusively to professional traders, indicating a cautious approach compared to traditional methods of service rollout within the crypto market. Preliminary reports indicate that Revolut X allows users to switch from fiat-to-crypto between Revolut and Revolut X, storing assets on “purpose-built defences.” The exchange is understood to charge zero fees to the maker of a trade and 0.09% to the taker.

So far, Revolut made no public announcement regarding its latest development. Crypto.news reached out for comment and we will update the article if we hear back.

Revolut has been thinking about starting its own crypto exchange for a while now. Early reports about this plan came out in 2021, when the London-headquartered company started looking for someone to lead the team “to architect and build Revolut Crypto exchange.”

The fintech company, which has a $25.7 billion valuation as of April, has been offering crypto services for several years. As of June 2023, Revolut had over 30 million customers worldwide and offers exposure to more than 50 tokens."

The U.S. SEC has recently issued a Wells notice to Robinhood Crypto, indicating a potential enforcement action for securities violations. This regulatory scrutiny is playing a significant role in shaping the competitive landscape among crypto exchanges, particularly benefiting Coinbase, according to Hougan.

In a post on the social media platform X, Hougan argued that the stringent regulatory environment inadvertently creates a competitive advantage for Coinbase by establishing an artificial moat around its operations. This advantage allows Coinbase to maintain high profit margins and achieve substantial earnings in the short term.

Coinbase, despite its ongoing disputes with the SEC, reported a revenue of $1.6 billion for the first quarter of 2024, fueled by increased transaction fees from institutional and consumer clients. The company’s financial success comes amidst broader regulatory actions, including last year’s lawsuit against Coinbase by the SEC, which accused the company of operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The regulator has also criticized Coinbase’s staking and wallet services.

Robinhood Crypto, a direct competitor, facilitates trading for various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Other entities have encountered similar regulatory challenges in the crypto space, such as decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap and Ethereum development studio Consensys, which received Wells notices from the SEC last month.

Hougan highlighted that despite regulatory hurdles, Coinbase is using this period to bolster its finances and diversify its operations.

“What’s impressive is that they are using this opportunity to both raise cash and massively diversified their business,” he said.

Bitwise, the company Hougan represents, has also been active in the crypto market, being the custodian for eight of nine spot Bitcoin ETFs trading since January 2024."

The allegations surfaced last Saturday when Alice of Shinoji Research posted that Bitfinex had suffered a significant data breach. The post, later deleted, was based on assertions from a hacking group, FSociety, which claimed responsibility for the supposed breach on April 26. The tweet suggested that about 2.5 Terabytes of data and personal details of 400,000 users had been compromised.

Ardoino’s review of Bitfinex’s systems revealed no evidence of a breach.

The compilation was misrepresented as a breach of Bitfinex, leveraging recycled credentials to create a false alarm.

Alice of Shinoji Research has since retracted the initial claim, clarifying the misunderstanding in a follow-up statement. She indicated that the information was erroneously presented as a new incident while it involved old data from various breaches collected by another group known as Flocker. The misrepresentation was intended to simulate a ransom demand, exploiting the fears of a major breach.

Ardoino believes this incident stresses the risks of reusing passwords across multiple platforms, a common practice that can lead to security vulnerabilities.

Blockchain researcher Crypto Koryo noted that CoinMarketCap captured over 138 new memecoins launched under the ERC-20 standard last month.

While the number grew more than seven times from April last year, CoinMarketCap only lists a fraction of deployed tokens. In other words, the number of new memecoins entering the market in the previous 30 days was likely much higher.

Meme coin speculation boosted by advanced tooling

Launching a meme coin, or any cryptocurrency, was more complex two years ago and required technical expertise that few had. However, emerging blockchain solutions and tools have made it possible in a few clicks, encouraging more creators to foray into the market.

New token standards have lowered the entry barrier, with developers fielding wrappers like the Runes protocol on Bitcoin (BTC) and inscription types like SRC-20, DRC-20, and ASC-20 on EVM chains. Introducing new standards and optimized on-chain transactions has also redirected liquidity from giants like Ethereum (ETH) to competitors like Solana (SOL).

The blockchain intelligence firm says the 46% drop in ransomware payments can be partly attributed to “enhanced cyber resilience among organizations,” adding that companies now possess a better understanding of the threats they face.

“[…] the availability of undisclosed decryptors from public and private sector efforts, such as those for the Rhysida strain, and major law enforcement actions like the Hive intervention have reduced the need for ransom payments in some instances, underscoring the value of reporting incidents to law enforcement.” Chainalysis

Chainalysis points out that even though there are more attacks, fewer people are paying ransoms, which reflects the “growing reluctance of victims to comply with the demands of cybercriminals.” Sanctions and more organizations refusing to fund criminal activities have also made paying ransoms seem unacceptable and unnecessary, the firm says.

“Continued victim reporting and collaboration with law enforcement can provide valuable intelligence, and as we’ve seen over the last year, and potentially provide victims with a decryptor that prevents them from paying the ransom.” Chainalysis

However, challenges still persist as some ransomware strains continue to evade detection, causing significant financial losses.

According to a local report, SEC chair Emilio B. Aquino said the guidelines would aim to regulate cryptocurrency trading in the nation while upholding investor security.

Aquino made the revelation while discussing the commission’s recent crackdown on unlicensed cryptocurrency service providers in the nation. Most recently, the regulator placed a ban on Binance for offering unregistered securities.

As a part of the crackdown on Binance, the SEC has requested both Apple and Google to remove the exchange’s applications from their respective stores. Citing the move as the commission just “doing its job,” Aquino added:

“I hope it’s fast. We already experienced this with lending apps before. The response is quick. It’s up to them (Google and Apple).”

Aquino acknowledged that some traders try to bypass these restrictions using “virtual private networks (VPN),” allowing them to access Binance’s platform despite a ban.

“But nobody gets to blame us,” he added.

Traders leveraging VPNs to bypass regulatory restrictions are quite common within the crypto sector. Following the ban on multiple foreign cryptocurrency exchanges in India, users were reportedly going down this route to access their crypto accounts.

The SEC chair reiterated that all crypto trading platforms in the Phillippines are required to obtain the necessary licenses to offer their services. The mandate is part of the nation’s Republic Act No. 8799, also known as the Securities Regulation Code (SRC).

He clarified that the recent moves are not meant to be “singling out” any particular platform.

“They have to secure the required licenses because the intention is to be able to run after them to exact their obligations,” the SEC chair continued.

He further cited the collapse of FTX, which led to billions of dollars in losses, and several investors were “burned.” Aquino added that the incident was a lesson for the Phillippines, which cannot “run after people outside” their jurisdiction, unlike the U.S.

Babylon, a blockchain project focused on security-sharing protocols in the decentralized economy, offers promising synergies for Solv Protocol. Binance Labs also announced an investment in Babylon in February.

The integration of Babylon’s restaking yield is expected to unlock new use cases for SolvBTC, particularly in securing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains, roll-ups, and Arbitrum Virtual Machines (AVMs).

This development leverages the substantial liquidity of Bitcoin and also facilitates its integration into various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Networks such as zkSync and Linea are poised to support SolvBTC bridging, further expanding its utility within the broader DeFi ecosystem.

Launched in April, SolvBTC has already garnered significant interest, with one user holding over 158,000 tokens. However, its trading volume, per CoinGecko data, remains relatively negligible, currently sitting at $514K over the last 24 hours. SolvBTC has continued to trail BTC’s price movements, changing hands at $61,401 at the time of writing."

Crypto exchange Crypto.com has registered 100 million users around the globe as the platform doubles down on its international expansion. In a blog announcement on May 6, the company claims the surge in the user base was the result of its marketing campaign, particularly its latest Fortune Favors the Brave brand film.

The Singapore-headquartered exchange says its user base has doubled since the first Formula 1 Crypto.com Miami Grand Prix in May 2022. Commenting on the growth, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszlek said the milestone was possible to achieve thanks to “engaging campaigns and iconic partnerships.”

The surge in user base occurred even despite the decreased activity of Crypto.com’s venture arm, Crypto.com Capital. As crypto.news reported earlier, the firm made only four deals since the start of 2023, compared with 35 in the two years prior to that period. Marszalek admitted the reduction in funding activities, saying that at this moment “valuations being thrown around by project teams are very generous,” while the firm is trying “to be reasonable on this.”

Crypto.com still trails behind its main competitors: Coinbase and Binance, which boast over 110 million and more than 170 million users respectively. While the company secured a few licenses for its global expansion, including the one granted by Dubai’s regulator, the company appears to be facing some headwinds in other markets.

In mid-May, the Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), imposed a €2,850,000 (approximately $3.1 million) administrative fine on Foris DAX MT, Crypto.com’s parent company, for violating local anti-money laundering regulations and anti-terrorist financing laws. A spokesperson for Crypto.com expressed disappointment but reassured that the incident has been resolved and has no impact on current operations or services.

Later, Crypto.com postponed its expansion into South Korea in April following reports of a money-laundering probe. A company spokesperson once again reiterated Crypto.com’s commitment to the highest anti-money laundering standards and stated that the decision to delay the launch was to ensure regulatory compliance and transparency with Korean authorities."

With the heightened trading volume and the sudden surge in Worldcoin’s open interest, higher price volatility would be expected due to whale activity and potential liquidations.

Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the total WLD funding rate aggregated from all exchanges dropped from 0.008% to 0.001% in the past 24 hours. This movement shows that the increased open interest has mostly come from augmented short positions.

In simple terms, the number of traders betting on a WLD price fall has impressively increased with the asset’s price rally.

Per a May 2 indictment, the accused has been charged with drug trafficking and laundering funds using the popular stablecoin Tether (USDT).

A direct descendent of Louis Cartier, the founder of the luxury watch, necklace, and bracelet maker, the accused was allegedly involved with the Colombian drug cartel. He attempted to import 100 kilos worth of cocaine and laundered millions of dollars via over-the-counter USDT trades.

Cartier employed multiple shell companies to execute his operations. These companies were reported as software and technology businesses. Using these company accounts, the accused laundered hundreds of millions of dollars worth of illicit proceeds via USDT, dollars, pesos, and other currencies.

According to the indictment, Cartier was using the shell companies as unlicensed money transmitters. Before his apprehension in Miami, he, alongside five other accomplices, managed to launder 14.5 million USDT.

Cartier is currently awaiting sentencing at a Miami detention center and will face four counts of criminal misconduct. His accomplices are being held in a Colombian prison.

He is currently facing charges for operating an unlicensed money remitter, transacting in property derived from illegal activities, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

The indictment closely follows Tether’s announcement on May 2 regarding its plan to develop a tool to monitor secondary market activity. Blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis will lead the development of the new tool. The solution will allow the stablecoin issuer to identify transactions potentially associated with illicit categories like terrorist financing.

In the past, Tether has actively worked alongside the law to clamp down on illicit transfers using USDT.

Wacy estimates that approximately 15% of altcoins could yield returns ranging from 10x to 100x during this anticipated altcoin season.

Among the key indicators cited by Wacy is the consolidation of over $700 billion in TOTAL3, excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which serves as a confirmation of a bullish trend.

TOTAL3 shows the total market capitalization of the top-125 cryptocurrencies, excluding BTC and ETH. This metric acts as a gauge for the broader altcoin market’s readiness to emerge from the shadow of Bitcoin.

In his analysis, Wacy highlights Ethena as a synthetic dollar protocol that provides a crypto-native alternative to conventional banking through the Internet bond.

Moreover, he notes that the next unlocking event for ENA is scheduled for April 2025 while emphasizing a familiar pattern observed on the weekly chart, typically preceding significant growth. Given the ongoing altcoin season, the pattern is anticipated to lead to a swifter rebound compared to projects launched during bearish market conditions.

Ethena Labs, the developer behind the synthetic dollar protocol, has recently received approval for a USDeFRAX liquidity pool in collaboration with Frax Finance. The move aims to diversify the yield of the FRAX stablecoin, further enhancing the ecosystem surrounding Ethena.

Additionally, the approval of the Singularity Roadmap proposal has paved the way for the creation of a USDeFRAX pool on the decentralized finance (DeFi) stablecoin exchange Curve, with a $250 million ceiling.

However, amidst the optimism surrounding Ethena and its ecosystem, concerns have been raised by Fantom developer Andre Cronje regarding the risks associated with the USDe peg system.

Visa, a global payment network, has raised concerns about the reliability of stablecoin transactions, opposing the common belief that they are becoming as popular as traditional money networks.

Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s head of crypto, suggested in a recent X thread that a significant portion of stablecoin transactions across many blockchain networks are influenced by “a lot of noise,” mainly due to automated bot activities.

3/ We found there can be a lot of noise in stablecoin data given that they can be used across a range of use cases with transactions that can be initiated manually by an end user or programmatically through bots. — Cuy Sheffield (@cuysheffield) April 25, 2024

Visa’s methodology of differentiating between stablecoin transactions relies on two metrics. Firstly, it focuses only on the largest stablecoin amount transferred within a single transaction, excluding smaller transactions resulting from complex smart contract interactions.

Secondly, it employs an “inorganic user filter,” targeting transactions initiated by accounts engaging in fewer than 1,000 stablecoin transactions and $10 million in transfer volume.

“This removes various bot activity as well as automatic transactions from large entities like centralized exchanges.” Visa

In a commentary to Bloomberg, Pranav Sood, executive general manager for EMEA at payments platform Airwallex, noted that data says that stablecoins “are still in a very nascent moment in their evolution as a payment instrument,” adding that in the short-term and the mid-term, the market should focus on “making sure that existing rails work much better.”

However, not everyone in the cryptocurrency market agrees with Visa’s findings, questioning their methodology. Nick van Eck, co-founder of Agora, a startup specializing in stablecoins, said in a statement to DL News that the data “makes no sense because then it would factor in trading firms, which are entirely legitimate businesses using these products.”"

This comes after the fund experienced $1.6 billion in outflows before the Bitcoin halving.

On May 3, GBTC recorded a net inflow of $63 million, according to data from Farside Investors. This marked the first positive net flow for the fund since its conversion to an ETF in January, when 11 new spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched in the U.S.

Several factors contributed to the consistent outflows from GBTC since its conversion to an ETF. One of the major reasons is the fund’s annual management fee of 1.5%, which is substantially higher than other Bitcoin ETFs that charge less than 1%.

Furthermore, the sell-off of GBTC shares by bankrupt crypto companies, like FTX and Genesis, has also driven the outflows. FTX sold about $1 billion worth of GBTC shares, and Genesis liquidated approximately 36 million shares, valued at $2.1 billion, to purchase Bitcoin.

On the same May 3, the market as a whole experienced a net inflow totalling $378 million. Noteworthy performances included Franklin Templeton’s Bitcoin ETF (EZBC), which recorded its highest-ever inflow of $60.9 million, and Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), which led the day with $102.6 million in inflows.

The inflow has stopped the streak of net withdrawals from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), At present, GBTC has $18.1 billion in assets, while IBIT has reached $16.9 billion. IBIT began with zero assets in January, whereas GBTC had over $26 billion. Although the inflow is a positive sign for GBTC, IBIT’s rapid growth is adding competitive pressure.

This shift from outflows to inflows in GBTC and the broader Bitcoin ETF market has brought a sense of optimism among investors, with some suggesting that this could be an early indicator of Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs. However, it remains to be seen if this momentum will continue, given the ongoing regulatory and market uncertainties.

Ethereum ETF: Grayscale remains hopeful

Grayscale says it’s confident that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve its spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by May, despite recent concerns about the SEC’s level of engagement with applicants and its ongoing investigation into the Ethereum Foundation.

Craig Salm, Chief Legal Officer at Grayscale, noted the similarities between the approval processes for spot Bitcoin ETFs and spot Ethereum ETFs, emphasizing that the core operations are fundamentally the same, with the key difference being the underlying asset – Bitcoin versus Ethereum.

This consistency, according to Salm, should make the SEC’s review process more straightforward, contributing to Grayscale’s optimism for a positive outcome.

Grayscale’s outlook stands in contrast to that of Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart. Both observers have reduced their expectations for spot Ethereum ETF approval in May to just 25%.

Balchunas suggested that the SEC’s apparent lack of engagement could be deliberate rather than merely a delay.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has also encouraged the SEC to approve Grayscale’s proposed spot Ethereum ETF. In a letter to the SEC, Coinbase argued that the logic used to justify the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs applies equally, if not more strongly, to the case for spot Ethereum ETFs.

The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck’s application by May 23, with the fate of other applicants expected to be announced around the same time. Companies like BlackRock, VanEck, Fidelity, and Grayscale are all actively pursuing approval for their spot Ethereum ETFs.

Grayscale’s confidence in the SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is based on the parallels between the processes for spot Bitcoin and spot Ethereum ETFs.

The company believes that the key issues the SEC addressed during the spot Bitcoin ETF approval process are largely the same for spot Ethereum ETFs, suggesting that the regulator’s experience with Bitcoin may pave the way for Ethereum."

Blockchain data reveals that Sun’s wallet, identified as “0x7a9…3095,” has transferred a total of 120,000 eETH, which are Ethereum-pegged tokens, into the Swell L2 liquid restaking protocol.

Justin Sun shakes up DeFi

This substantial deposit represents 46% of all deposits into the Swell L2 protocol. The 120,000 eETH, is a significant injection of capital into the platform.

Liquid restaking protocols like Swell L2 enable users to stake Ethereum and receive a liquid token, such as eETH, which can be used across various DeFi applications to earn additional returns. By depositing such a large sum, Sun has effectively become the leading player on Swell L2.

Sun’s entry into the liquid restaking space is part of his broader involvement in decentralized finance (DeFi). Last year, he played a key role in averting a liquidity crisis on Curve Finance by purchasing $2.3 million worth of CRV tokens.

Swell L2 has seen rapid growth, with its total value locked (TVL) approaching $3 billion ahead of the upcoming launch of its native governance token. Sun’s major deposit is likely to increase the protocol’s TVL further, reinforcing its position in the DeFi ecosystem.

While Justin Sun’s prominence on Swell L2 is notable, it raises questions about the long-term impact on the platform’s decentralization and governance. Regulators and industry observers will likely pay close attention to such large-scale deposits from influential figures in the crypto industry.

Sun has a well-established interest in Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies, regularly conducting large-scale transactions involving Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and others.

In a recent transaction on May 4, Sun transferred eETH worth approximately $376 million into the Swell L2 protocol. This deposit represents 46.6% of all deposits made to Swell L2 since its launch.

While Sun has been outspoken about his involvement in staking and liquid restaking platforms, he downplays the idea that he seeks to profit from his high-volume transactions.

Instead, the Tron founder explains that his role is to act as an advisor to liquid restaking teams, offering guidance rather than seeking direct profit.

Sun has shared his broader vision for staking and restaking. He emphasizes their potential to grow and attract global attention. He believes these platforms can serve as significant revenue sources for international businesses and institutions.

He also envisions that by reinvesting profits into supporting users, developers, and the broader community, these platforms can foster cooperation and drive growth.

However, It’s unclear whether Sun’s comments refer to a specific protocol or the industry at large, but his substantial investment into Swell L2 suggests that he is actively pursuing his vision."

His revelations come only months after reports emerged that Vodafone had entered into a 10-year strategic partnership with Microsoft to provide generative artificial intelligence (AI) services to its customers.

Furthermore, the telecommunications giant had previously shown its interest in web3 and blockchain technology when Pairpoint, then known as Digital Asset Broker (DAB), unveiled a proof of concept in collaboration with Sumitomo Corporation and Chainlink Labs.

The proof of concept was aimed at streamlining the exchange of trade documents across disparate platforms and blockchains, addressing the inefficiencies plaguing the global trade ecosystem, which is worth an estimated $32 trillion.

A group of plaintiffs from California and Florida filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division.

The plaintiffs — Gerardo Aceves, Thomas Fan, Edwin Martinez, Tiffany Smoot, Edouard Cordi, and Brett Maggard — allege that Coinbase’s sales of digital assets have knowingly violated state securities laws since the company’s inception.

The lawsuit claims that several tokens sold on Coinbase, such as Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Near Protocol (NEAR), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Uniswap (UNI), Tezos (XTZ), and Stellar Lumens (XLM), should be classified as securities.

According to the plaintiffs, Coinbase has admitted to being a “Securities Broker” in its user agreement, suggesting that the digital asset sales on the platform may qualify as investment contracts or other forms of securities.

The lawsuit also contends that Coinbase’s Prime brokerage functions as a securities broker.

The plaintiffs are seeking full rescission of these sales, statutory damages under state laws, and injunctive relief, with the matter proceeding to a jury trial. This lawsuit bears similarities to another class-action suit alleging consumer harm from Coinbase’s sale of securities.

Coinbase, however, has pushed back, arguing that secondary sales of crypto assets do not meet the criteria for securities transactions and questioning the applicability of securities regulations in this context.

This case is separate from Coinbase’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which also examines whether the tokens sold on Coinbase should be treated as securities. Recently, Coinbase filed an interlocutory appeal in response to a judge’s ruling allowing the SEC’s case to proceed.

Crypto.news reached out to Coinbase for comment but has not heard back.

In a separate development, pro-crypto lawyer John Deaton has stepped in to support Coinbase in its legal battle with the SEC by filing an amicus brief.

Deaton, known for his crypto advocacy and campaign against Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, is said to be providing his services pro bono.

His involvement coincides with Coinbase’s pushback against the SEC’s allegations and its efforts to gain clarity on regulatory matters, illustrating the ongoing tensions between cryptocurrency companies and financial regulators.

In June 2023, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, accusing the cryptocurrency exchange of operating as an unregistered national securities exchange and broker.

The SEC claims that Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that should have been registered as securities, including tokens like Solana, Cardano, and Polygon.

Separately, hundreds of Coinbase customers have sued the company over its handling of the GYEN stablecoin, which they argue was far from stable.

This lawsuit alleges that Coinbase promoted and traded the GYEN token despite being aware of its high volatility, leading to significant losses for investors.

Coinbase’s crypto staking program has also come under regulatory scrutiny. The SEC alleges that the program operates as an unregistered investment contract and security. Several U.S. states have joined the SEC’s case, accusing Coinbase of violating securities laws in connection with its staking rewards program.

Coinbase has pushed back against the regulatory crackdown. Armstrong has expressed pride in representing the crypto industry in court and has called for clearer regulations.

On May 4, Hoskinson posted a poll on X asking people what they thought about Cardano (ADA) partnering with Bitcoin Cash to boost its performance using technology like proof of useful work (PoUW), non-interactive proofs of proof-of-work (NIPoPoW), and Ergo technology.

In Hoskinson’s opinion, such upgrades could make BCH “the fastest and most useful” proof of work chain out there.

Hypothetical Poll:



Would you like to see Bitcoin Cash become a Cardano Partnerchain upgraded with Useful Proof of Work Leios, NiPoPoWs, and Ergo tech, thus being the fastest and most useful proof of work chain ever built? — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) May 4, 2024

At press time, the poll — which still has six days to run — had been voted on more than 11,800 times. Some 66% of the voters want to see the Bitcoin Cash and Cardano partnership become a reality.

A day before putting up the poll, Hoskinson took to X, asking members of the Bitcoin Cash community to clue him in on what was going on on the development side of BCH and what some of the network’s near-term priorities were.

I'm curious about Bitcoin Cash's roadmap. Can anyone from the Bitcoin Cash community point me to what's happening on the Dev side and some of the near-term priorities? — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) May 3, 2024

Hoskinson’s public interest in BCH comes on the heels of an altercation with MicroStrategy chairman and Bitcoin (BTC) maximalist Michael Saylor.

The difference in opinion cropped up after Saylor stated that altcoins like Cardano, Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and BNB will be classified as unregistered securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the summer.

Saylor also reportedly claimed that such altcoins will never be accepted by Wall Street in the manner Bitcoin has, following the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.

Hoskinson fired back at Saylor on X, making it clear that Cardano can handle whatever comes its way. With a hint of sarcasm, the Cardano founder suggested Bitcoin maximalists had a tendency to look down on other cryptocurrencies, considering all of them “illegal and a scam.”

Bitcoin Cash came into existence in 2017 following a prolonged and sometimes heated dispute within the Bitcoin community about how to scale the blockchain.

Bitcoin community members consider the cryptocurrency “digital gold” and emphasize its security and decentralization. They are less worried about the potential high fees and the limitations of using Bitcoin for payments.

On the other hand, supporters of Bitcoin Cash perceive their project primarily as digital cash. They believe BCH can compete effectively in payments without compromising its core properties or principles."

In response to the allegations, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, who is also the Bitfinex CTO, took to X to address the situation directly

“Everyone panicking for a potential database breach on bitfinex. Tldr: seems fake,” Ardoino posted on social media.

But, according to Shinoji Research, F Society has uploaded a page on their onion site, accompanied by two Mega links leading to a text file containing a partial dump of usernames and plaintext passwords.

Yet, Ardoino cited the absence of plaintext passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA) secrets in Bitfinex’s storage systems.

Source: Shinoji Research

The ransomware group has threatened to escalate the situation by leaking know-your-customer (KYC) documents to all users if their demands for a “substantial payment” were not met.

Given the volume of data claimed to be in their possession, it is suggested that they might have access to KYC documents spanning Bitfinex’s entire operation history.

The leaked data reportedly contains email domains, with one domain, coinfarm.co.za, drawing particular interest. However, most of the domains appear to be public rather than corporate, indicating a potential selective curation by the hackers.

– we don't store plaintext passwords, nor 2FA secrets in clear text.

– only 5k of 22.5k… — Paolo Ardoino 🍐 (@paoloardoino) May 4, 2024

In his posts, Ardoino sought to allay fears, suggesting that the purported breach may be unfounded.

“Different security researchers rushed to hype the breach,” he said. “Yet from what we could gather, the hackers collected a database of emails/passwords likely from different crypto breaches. Most of users unfortunately use same email/passwords across multiple sites.”

Bitfinx is conducting a “deep analysis” of its systems and “no breach was found currently,” Ardoino added, calling it “pure FUD.”

Furthermore, Ardoino pointed out discrepancies in the leaked data, such as only a fraction of the email addresses matching Bitfinex users. He questioned the legitimacy of the hackers’ claims, noting their failure to contact Bitfinex through established channels for reporting vulnerabilities or seeking ransom.

Ardoino also shed light on the possibility that the leaked data could be aggregated from various crypto breaches, as many users tend to reuse email and password combinations across multiple platforms.

Additionally, Ardoino emphasized the robust rate-limiting measures in place for the KYC platform, which would prevent bulk downloading of sensitive information.

Meanwhile, in a separate post, Ardoino shared insights from a security researcher who speculated that the purported hack may be a ploy to advertise a hacking tool for sale.

Here a message from a security researcher (that instead of panicking, trying to dig a bit more into it).

The message allegedly originated from a Telegram channel, suggesting that the dissemination of claims regarding Bitfinex’s breach could serve as a marketing tactic to promote the tool’s efficacy.

In light of these developments, Ardoino posed a question to the crypto community regarding the likelihood of some of the valid emails belonging to crypto users compiled from previous breaches. “If someone compiles a database of 100k emails clearly belonging to people in crypto (collected from all previous crypto hacks), how likely is it that 20% of those are valid emails on some crypto exchange?” The Bitfinex CTO asked.

Vinnik’s guilty plea comes in the wake of a broader investigation that unearthed extensive illegal activities on the exchange from 2011 to 2017.

BTC-e Operator Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Conspiracy



Exchange Moved Over $9B Worth of Transactions; Defendant Caused Criminal Losses in Excess of $100M



🔗: https://t.co/yMrJMgn9qC pic.twitter.com/nRyad1AH7D — Criminal Division (@DOJCrimDiv) May 3, 2024

BTC-e: Conduit for laundering funds

In a May 3 press release, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) revealed that at the time Vinnik was at the helm of BTC-e, the exchange processed no less than $9 billion in transactions and amassed a global user base exceeding one million, with many of them located in the U.S.

According to the DoJ, BTC-e served as a conduit for laundering funds acquired from a variety of criminal activities.

Moreover, the DoJ’s investigation revealed that BTC-e operated without having compliance measures such as registration with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in place.

Furthermore, the exchange did not put its customers through anti-money laundering (AML) or know-your-customer (KYC) protocols in the period it operated.

Additionally, investigators found Vinnik to have established numerous shell companies and financial accounts worldwide, facilitating the illicit transfer of funds through BTC-e, resulting in criminal losses totaling at least $121 million.

The case gained traction following a 2017 report by WizSecurity, which revealed BTC-e’s involvement in the Mt. Gox hack.

The report detailed how hackers, in collaboration with BTC-e and Vinnik, laundered stolen Bitcoins through the exchange, implicating Vinnik in the illicit activity.

In February, the DoJ indicted Belarusian Aliaksandr Klimenka as the main defendant in the BTC-e case, alongside Vinnik.

Klimenka faces charges of conspiracy to launder money and running an unlicensed financial services business, with an estimated $4 billion in laundered funds.

At the time of Klimenka’s indictment, the DoJ stated that BTC-e servers in the U.S. were crucial tools for criminal operations, purportedly supported by Klimenka and his company Soft-FX.

Following BTC-e’s closure by American law enforcement in 2017, Vinnik was arrested near Thessaloniki, Greece. After extradition to the U.S. in 2022, the Russian-born crypto entrepreneur faced accusations of money laundering and other offenses.

Despite attempts to revive and rebrand BTC-e as WEX, the venture eventually shuttered, leaving many users unable to withdraw funds.

In 2023, Alexey Bilyuchenko, a Vinnik associate and the former technology administrator of BTC-e, was fined and sentenced to three years and six months in prison for misappropriating the exchange’s funds."

On-chain investigator ZachXBT and crypto security provider Cyvers corroborated the news. Cyvers CTO Meir Dolev said the case was “probably the highest value lost due to an address poisoning scam” to date.

In an address poisoning scam, victims are presented with a similar wallet address and deceived into transferring assets to an exploiter. The malicious address usually imitates the four to six characters at the beginning and end of an address.

Users fall prey to this method as the differences are sometimes hard to spot, especially since wallet addresses may exceed 40 alpha-numeric characters in some cases.

According to the expert, the convicted entrepreneur will not be released on parole under any circumstances. Despite this, there is a chance Bankman-Fried will leave prison early, as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons has the right to award the FTX founder good behavior status, thus being released earlier than the date specified in the sentence. To do this, the convicted person must avoid disciplinary sanctions and demonstrate good behavior.

However, the reward will not significantly shorten Bankman-Fried’s prison time, as D’Angelo noted that inmates like Bankman-Fried serve 85% of their sentences in most cases. Per this precedent, the former head of FTX will likely spend at least 21 years in prison.

In addition, the crypto lawyer ruled out the possibility of Bankman-Fried being pardoned by President Joe Biden.

Taking into account the sentence, the entrepreneur accused of multibillion-dollar fraud will have the time spent in custody awaiting his sentence counted as time served.

There are various options for the prison to which Bankman-Fried could be sent. The authorities will determine the specific penitentiary facility based on the characteristics of his case, his psychological state, and other factors, D’Angelo concluded.

What’s next for BTC?

Last month, a hardcoded on-chain shift designed by BTC creator Satoshi Nakamoto went live, slashing block mining rewards by 50% and straining miner revenues. The Bitcoin halving maintains scarcity by curtailing token inflation, introducing a fresh supply dynamic to the market.

Historically, a market lull follows the halving and prices stagnate for some time before rising higher. Speculators surmised that the trend might change in the short-term during this cycle, but an expert told crypto.news that the long-term impact outweighs immediate price movement.

DCL.Link Partnerships Lead Peter M. Moricz said BTC miners must adopt a more energy-efficient approach and hedge operations to cover expenses. One miner, Stronghold Digital Mining, is assessing its options to stay afloat, including selling its business to maximum shareholder value.

Moricz argued that a major concern is mining centralization, rather than revenue. As more entities consolidate businesses and possible mergers occur, the risk of government influence increases, and “this is the main concern for the BTC ecosystem going forward,” Moricz explained.

Regarding price action, the financial markets veteran remarked that higher BTC prices are inevitable despite skepticism from some Wall Street stalwarts."

The Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) statement said that the man, whose name was not released, would remain in custody for 14 days in the Netherlands for investigative purposes.

The agency clarified that the detainee may be involved in a large-scale scam related to the rug pull of the ZKasino project. Numerous complaints led to an investigation into the case, which began on April 25.

The statement said that FIOD worked closely with the Financial Crimes Authority and the Binance crypto exchange team during the investigation. The investigative team, together with the prosecutor’s office, identified those who participated in the rug pull project.

During the arrest, law enforcement agencies confiscated digital assets, real estate, and a luxury car worth $12.2 million. The department did not rule out new arrests in this case.

ZKasino was suspected of a rug pull after user funds amounting to more than $32 million were transferred to unknown wallets. After that, the team closed the Telegram group and stopped responding to messages.

In connection with the incident, the MEXC crypto exchange canceled the listing of the native token of the ZKAS project, and the Ape Terminal platform canceled the IDO.

One of the purported investors, Big Brain, later denied its participation in the funding round. In turn, the MEXC platform stated that it was a victim of the incident."

Former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden is urging blockchain developers to prioritize implementing privacy measures in Bitcoin on the protocol level, following the recent closure of mixing services in the U.S.

In an X post on May 3, Snowden noted he’d been warning Bitcoin developers “for ten years that privacy needs to be provided for at the protocol level,” adding that “the clock is ticking” in response to ZkSNACKs’ announcing the closure of Coinjoin, a crypto mixing service that is set to sunset its services on Jun. 1.

ZkSNACKs, the developer behind Wasabi Wallet, earlier announced its decision to stop supporting Coinjoin amid increasing pressure from law enforcement in the U.S.

The service’s shutdown follows New York federal prosecutors accusing Samourai Wallet founders of illegal transactions worth over $2 billion, signaling a wider crackdown on suspect crypto wallets and mixers by U.S. authorities. As crypto.news reported earlier, the severity of the charges highlights a broader crackdown by U.S. authorities on crypto wallets and mixers engaged in questionable activities.

Meanwhile, Snowden also drew attention on X to concerns raised by Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, regarding proposed reforms to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The former NSA contractor echoed Goitein’s warnings, saying the NSA is now “days away from taking over the internet.”"
https://crypto.news/ceo-of-loka-mining-on-bitcoins-defi-possibilities/,CEO of Loka Mining on Bitcoin’s DeFi possibilities,2024-05-03 11:48:07+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","Speaking to crypto.news in an interview, Andy Fajar Hardika, CEO of Loka Mining, discussed the evolution of decentralized finance (defi) on the Bitcoin network.

On April 19, 2024, Bitcoin mining rewards were slashed in half. Mining a block will now generate only 3.125 BTC, compared to the previous 6.25 BTC. Although the Bitcoin halving happens every four years or so this year, it’s really got industry participants talking about how the reduced rewards will affect the mining economy.

With each halving event, mining firms have to adapt to a lower-margin environment. Cash-strapped firms usually exit the market or merge with bigger firms. Unlike the earlier halving events in 2016 and 2020, the 2024 halving event may result in a slew of consolidation and defaults.

Enter Runes and Ordinals, concepts that are revolutionizing the defi landscape on the Bitcoin network.

Runes, like Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, introduce fungible tokens to the Bitcoin blockchain, while Ordinals bring NFTs directly onto the network. As the premiere cryptocurrency, this goes a long way in broadening the possibilities of what Bitcoin can offer beyond simple transactions.

With Runes and Ordinals, Bitcoin is finding new ways to close the gap with Ethereum, which has largely been hailed as the king of defi. However, nothing is without its challenges. Scalability issues and concerns over blockchain bloat loom large, echoing past impediments in the industry.

Still, the birth of protocols like Runes and Ordinals shows that Bitcoin can support more diverse decentralized applications. Miners, in return, are able to offset the halving’s effect on revenue.

Hardika, who leads a cryptocurrency mining firm, shared his insights on the matter.

How do you perceive Bitcoin’s evolving role in the defi space, given its recent advances like the Runes protocol and the impact it’s had on miner revenues and transaction fees?

Bitcoin lacks programmability but has the strongest Lindy effect and has proven to become the de facto store of value. I personally believe these characteristics are driving Bitcoin to be the “mother chain,” attracting new protocols that are blooming on Bitcoin’s L2 or sidechain.

In your opinion, can Bitcoin position itself as a competitor to Ethereum in decentralized finance, or do you foresee a different outcome?

I think what we will see in the end is not rivalry, but rather collaboration — where chains will be “fused” and abstracted away to a point that regular users don’t really care or need to understand which chain they’re currently using.

With Runes driving transaction fees to new heights, how do you think Bitcoin can balance rewarding miners with keeping transactions affordable and accessible? Are high fees hindering Bitcoin’s adoption for smaller transactions?



As Bitcoin transitioned from a P2P e-cash system to a Store of Value, I believe the high transaction fee on Bitcoin L1 is important. It serves as a trade-off for the security budget the network needs to maintain. This is where L2s take part in scaling the network and adding programmability to Bitcoin. From a user’s perspective, solutions like Lightning or ICP with their ckBTC enable Bitcoin transaction fees to be reduced to just a few cents.

Historically, Bitcoin has lagged behind Ethereum in defi applications. How likely is it that innovations like Runes and Ordinals will help Bitcoin close this gap? What are Bitcoin’s advantages or challenges in this space?



Ordinals is basically fully on-chain NFT, parallel to ERC721, while Runes is essentially Fungible Tokens on Bitcoin, parallel to ERC-20. These are just early building blocks for Bitcoin programmability. While it’s now possible to build an L1 primitive dApp, it’s still very limited. I believe the actual use case would be like anchor points for the L2s to provide a full-blown defi app on Bitcoin. One significant advantage would be that we can unlock the massive Bitcoin TVL that is currently sitting in their holders’ wallets.

Some critics argue that protocols like Runes and Ordinals could lead to blockchain bloat and slower transaction times. What are your thoughts on these drawbacks, and how do they compare to Ethereum’s scalability challenges?

History tends to repeat itself. A few years back, we had CryptoKitties, the first gamified NFT on the Ethereum network, consuming 13% of all transactions in the Ethereum network. This ignited the discussion about network scalability and eventually sparked many upgrades and the rise of L2s on Ethereum.

Do you expect a similar trend?

I believe we see parallels between Runes and Ordinals, which are now taking significant block space and contributing a significant amount to the network’s security budget. As an indirect result, there are now more than 50 Bitcoin Layers or sidechains trying to solve Bitcoin’s scalability. And of course, just like startups, most of them will eventually die down or become dormant — but those with strong utility and actual use cases will survive."

The firm, which provides price data for the ETFs, is now handling about $24 billion worth of crypto ETFs, according to a Bloomberg report, representing roughly half of the crypto benchmarking market.

CF Benchmarks CEO Sui Chung said in an interview the firm sees crypto ETFs reaching Israel and South Korea next, saying the latter has gained a “high degree of [crypto] adoption.”

“South Korea is a market where ETFs have become the wrapper of choice for long-term savings.” Sui Chung

Initially, the firm expected $5 billion in assets this year for the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs using its data. However, Chung disclosed that the actual demand far exceeded the projection, surpassing four times the expected amount.

In mid-April, Hong Kong granted approval for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a few months after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the go-ahead to several spot Bitcoin ETF applications in the U.S. However, while Hong Kong progresses, the SEC appears to be taking a more cautious approach regarding spot Ethereum ETFs, potentially postponing approvals until later in 2024 or even beyond.

According to a letter to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, sent on May 1, the senators have urged the Biden administration to detail the possible ties between the Iranian government and local crypto miners.

Senators Warren and King believe that digital assets being mined in Iran are being used to bypass U.S. sanctions and fund terrorist organizations like “Hezbollah.” Further, they allege that these funds were also used to fuel the nation’s attack on Israel in April.

Iran has been sanctioned by U.S. along with other international bodies since 1979. Earlier this year, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on several entities involved in the illegal export of technology from multiple U.S. companies to Iran.

“Unless we take action, Iran will continue to use crypto to fund attacks against Israel,” the letter stated.

In the letter, the duo cited a report that claimed the Iranian government preferred “newly minted” Bitcoin since it is “less traceable.” It was also reported that Bitcoin miners in the nation generated $1 billion in revenue in 2021.

As such, the Senators have asked U.S. officials to provide data on revenue generated by Iranian crypto miners, its potential use in money laundering, and how they plan on addressing these “threats to U.S. national security.”

Interestingly, the Iranian government has cracked down on the cryptocurrency mining sector on multiple occasions since mining was legalized in the nation in 2019.

In 2021, the nation confiscated approximately 150,000 pieces of crypto-mining equipment to address concerns of electricity depletion. The equipment, however, was released in January of last year."

According to a request filed by FTX Trading Ltd and connected debtors with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on May 1, Ryan Salame has agreed to give up a $5.9 million mansion in the Bahamas.

Salame pleaded guilty to criminal charges in September 2023, and his plea deal compelled him to pay $5.6 million in compensation to the debtors.

Salame offers that rather than paying cash, he meet the restitution by transferring ownership of his home to FTX Digital Markets Ltd.

“Salame will satisfy the Restitution Amount by transferring a residence he owns in the Bahamas, Unit No. 3A in the Marina Residences at Albany Building 10 Condominium, to FTX DM,” according to the document.

The debtors contended that this is in their best interests since it saves Salame from having to sell the residence soon and at a discount, which could jeopardize their ability to monetize other Bahamian properties.

In 2023, Bahamian realtors stated that high-end sales volumes had fallen by much to 25%. Meanwhile, Australian real estate agency Properstar revealed that apartment prices have decreased by 28% in the last year.

Salame faces charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions and deceive the Federal Election Commission, as well as conspiracy to operate an unauthorized money-transmitting business.

The petition also stated that Salame committed to buy the property for $7.2 million in September 2021, with the 10% deposit deposited from an Alameda Research account at Silvergate Bank.

In November of that year, FTX DM sent $8.1 million from its Fidelity Bank account in the Bahamas to Salame’s real estate attorney to pay the remaining purchase price.

Salame and Alameda signed a promissory note in March 2022, agreeing that he would pay Alameda $8.1 million. However, FTX and Alameda collapsed in early November 2022, with bankruptcy filings following shortly thereafter.

The Aave community is gearing up to vote on a proposal by ChaosLabs, which suggests deprecating multiple small-cap stablecoins, including Paxos USD (USDP) and Gemini Dollar (GUSD) on Aave V2.

In the description of the proposal, ChaosLabs says the move should be made in response to “recent events,” which have highlighted the need for Aave “to reduce its V2 exposure to lesser-used stablecoins, many of which have limited liquidity, thus allowing for price manipulation and other potentially harmful events.”

The proposal outlines a phased approach, aiming to address concerns regarding lesser-used stablecoins, which can be susceptible to price manipulation due to their limited liquidity. ChaosLabs says that under the proposed plan, borrowing for USDP, GUSD, LUSD, FRAX, and sUSD would be disabled, and various parameters, including reserve factors and base rates, would be adjusted “to encourage borrowers to repay their loans.”

While consensus has apparently been achieved within the community, the proposal still needs to undergo a snapshot vote until May 6 for final approval. Following the conclusion of the vote, an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) will be submitted to implement the proposed updates.

The proposal follows a recent surge in USDP’s price across various exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, with reports from the Chainlink Oracle indicating a peak above $1.20.

Starting in April, the company has been allocating 10% of its monthly gross profit from Bitcoin-related products to purchase additional Bitcoin. The strategy is set to continue throughout the remainder of 2024.

Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy that involves investing a fixed dollar amount into a particular asset at regular intervals, irrespective of the asset’s price at the time. The method is commonly used to mitigate the effects of price volatility.

The move by Block, Inc. follows the increased acceptance of Bitcoin as a mainstream investment option, highlighted by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of several Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January. This growing mainstream recognition mirrors the company’s commitment to investing in Bitcoin.

“We believe the world needs an open protocol for money, one that’s not owned or controlled by any single entity…Our investment in Bitcoin transcends technology; it is an investment in a future where economic empowerment is the norm.” Jack Dorsey said in the note.

Despite the increased focus on Bitcoin, Dorsey noted that less than 3% of Block’s resources are currently dedicated to Bitcoin-related projects. However, the company has updated its earnings expectations, forecasting annual adjusted core earnings of at least $2.76 billion, an increase from the previously projected $2.63 billion.

Subsequent investments in February 2021 included the addition of 3,318 BTC at a significantly greater price of $51,236 each.

As of March 31, 2024, Block reported owning 8,038 BTC valued at $573 million, with paper gains amounting to $233 million.

In a press release on May 3, ASIC said the court determined that BPS lacked the necessary financial services license “nor was authorised by a licence holder, to issue or provide financial advice about the Qoin Wallet.”

“Justice Downes also found BPS engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct and made false or misleading representations concerning the Qoin Wallet.” ASIC

The ruling highlighted that BTX, the sole crypto exchange that was accepting Qoin tokens, lacked independence from BPS and didn’t allow for the exchange of various altcoins.

ASIC Chair Joe Longo underscored the significance of the ruling, marking the first court case against a crypto-based non-cash payment facility. He also added that the proceedings “should send a message to the crypto industry that their products will continue to be scrutinised by ASIC to ensure consumers are protected and that they comply with regulatory obligations.”

The court has instructed both parties to work together to determine the next steps for further hearings, which will address remaining issues including penalties. A date for the hearing will be set later in 2024.

If Jito succeeds, it will enter a $15.2 billion restaking market currently dominated by EigenLayer and likely foray into a liquid restaking scene with projects like Ether.fi."

The Electric Coin Company (ECC), a firm behind the Zcash cryptocurrency, has announced a shift in its funding approach for the token, signaling a departure from direct protocol funding and advocating for decentralization as the current development fund, established in 2020, is set to expire later this year.

In a statement released on May 1, the Colorado-based company expressed concerns about the current funding model, referring to it as the “dev tax,” and highlighted the need for community-driven initiatives to determine the future of Zcash.

“Some love the development fund model, and some vilify it. To many, it became known as the ‘dev tax.’ Recently, I have publicly expressed criticism of the model as currently designed. Regardless of our own opinions, we are not beholden to the past.” ECC CEO Josh Swihart

As the development fund nears its end in November, several Zcash-focused initiatives are uncertain about their future. Swihart indicates that the current funding model may not provide sufficient support for these organizations to continue operating as before.

“In November, the amount of block rewards will be cut in half. If ECC and the Zcash Foundation were to continue to receive the same allocation as they do today, the proceeds would be insufficient to meet either’s financial needs at the current price of ZEC.” Josh Swihart

In response to these challenges, ECC has decided “not to accept funds directly from the protocol under a new development fund,” adding that the firm’s wallet address will no longer be codified in the protocol.

Instead, ECC proposes two options for the Zcash community: allowing the development fund to expire or transitioning to a grants-based model that would increase decentralization and community participation in decision-making. Amid the news, ZEC price soared by nearly 10% up to $22.8, according to data from CoinMarketCap."
https://crypto.news/former-biden-advisor-predicts-us-crypto-regulation-imminent/,Former Biden advisor predicts US crypto regulation imminent,2024-05-02 12:50:04+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","The double-edged nature of cryptocurrencies has become increasingly apparent, particularly in their role in facilitating child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Speaking to crypto.news, former Whitehouse insider Moe Vela said he expects the government to intervene soon.

U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bill Cassidy have attacked the cryptocurrency sector, raising concerns about the matter. Federal agencies have been urged to enhance their capacity to detect and prosecute cryptocurrency transactions linked to CSAM.

Their call comes at a critical time when privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and mixing services have been identified as tools for laundering funds derived from CSAM, as detailed in recent studies by Chainalysis and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

The senators’ concerns have prompted the Department of Justice (DOJ) to take action against platforms like KuCoin and Binance, which involved charges related to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and the processing of suspicious transactions. The call for tighter regulation and industry-wide oversight is evident as agencies continue to develop new tools and strategies to address the growing misuse of digital assets for criminal activities.

Offering his insights into this critical issue, Moe Vela, Senior Advisor to Unicoin and Former Senior Advisor to President Biden, shared his perspective in an exclusive interview.

Recent events have raised concerns about cryptocurrencies facilitating illegal activities like CSAM. With Senators Warren and Cassidy calling for tighter regulations, what impact do these proposed changes have on the crypto market, particularly in curbing illegal activities?

These horrific challenges are inevitable with the introduction of new currency or financial system. The fact that it was a bipartisan approach will bring the effort from the two Senators some extra viability for the implementation of some solutions. I predict that within the next year, our nation will have crypto regulation that I hope will be preventative in nature informational and empowering but NOT destructive of the sector. The federal government must fight the urge to over-regulate in a reactive manner. Healthy regulation is inevitable and necessary.

Building on the senators’ concerns, what regulations do you see as critical to mitigate the risks of cryptocurrencies enabling child sexual abuse materials (CSAM)?

I am confident that the ultimate result will be a U.S. regulatory environment as it relates to cryptocurrency that will mirror many of the parameters, restrictions and protections of the regulatory standards of traditional currency and financial systems.

Given the anonymity and decentralization of cryptocurrencies, which can enable illicit activities like the purchase of CSAM, how crucial is government involvement in fostering transparency and ensuring that cryptocurrencies are backed by real assets?

As a senior advisor to Unicoin, this is a topic I am quite passionate about. I do believe that the federal government has an integral role in creating a regulatory environment that fosters and encourages transparency, as well as asset-back cryptocurrencies. As I have said publicly for several years, buying Bitcoin could very possibly put you in business with nefarious forces and probably some of the world’s most dangerous dictators and nations. Not to mention, that with those early cryptocurrencies, you are simply buying and trading air. It is beyond my comprehension that investors would feel safe and confident in buying any security that is not asset-backed.

How can we strike a balance between regulation and fostering innovation to ensure compliance without stifling the industry?

I am one of those in the cryptocurrency sector who advocates for total transparency, and asset-backed and compliant crypto. The regulations that will be necessary and forthcoming will be less stringent and harsh, in my opinion, as it relates to the risk-mitigating nature of asset-backed, transparent and compliant crypto.

Drawing from traditional financial systems, how can safeguards be adapted to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency to prevent misuse, especially in cases like CSAM transactions?

In several speeches on this topic the past few years, I have stressed how vital it is that we look at what has worked well in traditional financial systems and what regulations have been effective in the prevention of CSAM transactions and other egregious activities. We simply enact that which has worked and disregard that which was ineffective as the crypto regulatory parameters are developed and implemented. There is no need to completely reinvent the wheel. It’s a new and young frontier but lessons from the past will be vital in setting the tone for the sector’s regulatory future.

On a broader scale, given global financial and security standards, how important is international collaboration in framing regulations that address the use of cryptocurrencies in illegal activities?

The global nature of the cryptocurrency, digital and financial systems make it absolutely mandatory that the United States collaborate with allies around the world. It is imperative that crypto regulatory standards be respected, adhere to and enforceable across geographic lines. This digital age and blockchain knows no geographic boundaries so regulations, laws and policies must be geo-blind.

Finally, what proactive roles should cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers undertake to prevent the use of their platforms for illegal transactions, particularly involving CSAM?

First and foremost, every wallet provider and crypto exchange should not be waiting for regulations and guidance from the government. Everyone involved in the crypto and blockchain eco-system MUST be proactive and implement company policies and procedures that mitigate the risk of nefarious activities, including CSAM. In Texas where I grew up, we would say they need to take the bull by the horns.

So what do you suggest?

Play offense and don’t wait to play defense is a consistently strong approach when it comes to these regulatory and policy discussions. It is very important that the sector unite and be a part of the solution—waiting until the regulations are developed and implemented and then just complaining is irresponsible. Now is the time to get involved and be at the table as they are being developed and discussed."

MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor announced the solution, named ‘MicroStrategy Orange,’ at the company’s Bitcoin For Corporations conference on May 1.

Saylor explained that the solution’s purpose is to provide trustless, tamper-proof, and durable decentralized identities by solely utilizing the public Bitcoin blockchain.

“[Its aim is to] deliver trustless, tamper-proof, and long-lived decentralized identities using only the public Bitcoin blockchain as a data source,” according to an unauthorized draft of the solution released by MicroStrategy on GitHub.

Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) will enable pseudonymity in the same way that real-world identities are not linked with Bitcoin addresses and transactions.

MicroStrategy Orange is comprised of several components: Orange Service, Orange SDK, and Orange Applications.

Orange Service enables users to issue DIDs to their personnel and deploy applications. Meanwhile, the Orange SDK and Orange Applications provide the necessary tools for customization and integration on various devices.

""Wouldn't it be great if instead of a blue check, green check, etc., there was an orange check that was a global standard? With MicroStrategy, maybe we could approach this idea of decentralized identity, with Bitcoin.""

MicroStrategy has already developed an application called “Orange For Outlook,” which incorporates digital signatures into emails so that receivers may authenticate the sender’s actual identity.

Accepting an invitation email signed by MicroStrategy’s DID initiates the onboarding process, which generates a unique DID as well as a public and private key pair for each user.

The user’s DID and public key are stored on the Bitcoin network, and they can then begin inviting their personnel to create their own digital identities.

Looking ahead, MicroStrategy aims to extend the capabilities of its Orange applications across other messaging platforms, social media networks, and various applications in the e-commerce, enterprise, and fintech sectors.

Previous BTC-based identity solutions

Microstrategy is not the first company to investigate Bitcoin as a potential identity solution. In 2016, the BitID project was launched to simplify identity verification for online platforms, ensuring user privacy. However, this project is no longer active.

Furthermore, ION (Identity Overlay Network) is an autonomous identity system that operates on a Sidetree-based DID network and incorporates the Bitcoin blockchain and IPFS.

Other blockchain networks, such as Worldcoin, use similar tactics to construct a global digital identity and financial network.

Ecuador’s Sistema de Dinero Electrónico is also notable. Ecuador introduced a digital currency linked to a government-issued digital ID system, allowing citizens to access and use the currency using their ID. Ecuador’s initiative was finally phased out after facing criticism from state banks.

MicroStrategy’s announcement comes shortly after the company reported a net loss of $53.1 million for the first quarter on April 30.

Notably, the figure does not account for the significant increase in the market value of their Bitcoin holdings. The company currently holds 214,400 Bitcoin, which appreciated by 65% over the quarter, valued at $15.2 billion at that time."

In a press release on May 1, the Department of Justice said that Dalpour purportedly enticed investors with promises of “huge returns” through investments in a Las Vegas hospitality business and a crypto trading operation.

Allegedly, these promises were false, and Dalpour operated a classic Ponzi scheme, the FBI says, adding that Dalpour used investors’ funds to pay earlier investors while spending the rest on himself, including gambling losses totaling approximately $1.7 million and private school tuition for his children.

He allegedly diverted investors’ funds for personal use rather than investing in the promised ventures. Dalpour also reportedly misled investors by claiming their funds were insured and secure. If convicted, Dalpour faces up to 20 years in prison for wire fraud.

PEPE is up by 13.5% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $0.00000694 at the time of writing. The asset’s market cap increased to $2.92 billion, making it the 35th-largest digital currency.

According to data provided by Santiment, the PEPE exchange inflow declined from 5.57 trillion tokens to 5.47 trillion tokens over the past 24 hours. The exchange outflow, however, registered a small hike and is hovering at 6 trillion PEPE.

This market behavior shows that investors are slightly accumulating the meme coin rather than selling for short-term profit.

Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the number of Pepe daily active addresses has consistently increased over the past three days — from 2,670 on April 29 to 3,249 unique wallets at the reporting time.

When the price surges along with the number of active addresses, lower price volatility is usually expected due to a lower chance of whale manipulation.

On the other hand, the PEPE Relative Strength Index (RSI) surged from 64 to 72, showing signs of overheating, per Santiment. At this point, the RSI indicator suggests that PEPE is moderately overvalued, and high price volatility is usually expected in these market conditions.

An RSI of below the 50 mark could potentially suggest a further price hike for PEPE."

Bipartisan lawmakers Reps. Wiley Nickel, D-N.C., and Drew Ferguson, R-Ga, introduced the Providing Tax Clarity for Digital Assets Act on May 1 to clarify how staking rewards are taxed. The law proposes preventing double taxation by taxing the staking rewards only at the time of sale.

The bill would define staking rewards as created property under the U.S. tax code.

“The Providing Tax Clarity for Digital Assets Act would give the industry desperately wanted tax clarity, establish United States leadership in digital asset tax treatment, and encourages innovation and business in the United States,” Rep. Ferguson said.

Staking rewards are earned by cryptocurrency holders who actively participate in securing and validating a blockchain network, receiving additional tokens as an incentive. The complexity arises because their taxation remains unclear, with many investors confused over whether rewards should be taxed upon receipt or sale.

The proposed law responds to an earlier ruling by the Internal Revenue Service. According to the tax watchdog, crypto investors earning staking rewards are required to include the value of those rewards in their gross income when filing taxes.

The proposed law has garnered positive feedback from the broader community. The idea of taxing block rewards from proof-of-work or proof-of-stake networks only at the time of sale has been met with enthusiasm. In a statement to crypto.news, Taha Abbasi, Chief Technology Officer at staking technology Infrastructure provider Ferrum Network, expressed his optimism, stating:

“We applaud the initiative by U.S. Congressman Drew Ferguson (R-GA) and Congressman Wiley Nickel (D-NC) to facilitate clarification in Tax Legislation for digital assets specifically relating to staking technologies […] We believe this bill will help cement the US as not only the leader in technical innovation, but also legal and regulatory innovation to support our ever evolving technical ecosystem.”

Meanwhile, Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, called the law “right on point,” adding that the bill will offer the “needed clarity.”

Both Rep. Nickel and Rep. Ferguson have advocated for implementing clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets. Last year, Rep. Nickel played a key role in pushing the Financial Innovation and Technology Act, which looks to create a regulatory framework for digital assets designed to protect consumers and encourage innovation.

The bill closely followed the fourth Bitcoin halving event on April 19, which reduced Bitcoin mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block."

CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno said in an interview with crypto.news that the network hashrate remains slightly higher than pre-halving levels, noting that miners “can still make a profit” with “relatively efficient equipment.”

Moreno says the profitability is still can be seen in the break-even electricity price for ASIC models S19 and S21, which remain above the electricity cost of large industrial miners (green area).

However, he also noted that some retail miners, particularly those using older ASICs like S17 and S19, may be experiencing negative profits “due to higher electricity costs,” adding a capitulation event “will depend on how network hashrate and prices evolve in the next few weeks.”

Addressing concerns about potential price volatility during the summer trading slowdown, Moreno emphasized that miners typically respond to price movements rather than the other way around. Yet, he didn’t rule out the possibility that Bitcoin could see more selling pressure in the coming months.

“[The market is] more likely to see a miner capitulation if prices don’t recover significantly during the summer. Especially with the hashprice (average miner revenue per hash) making new lows.” Julio Moreno

As crypto.news reported earlier, Bitcoin miners are not selling their crypto holdings at current prices even though their revenue has dropped to levels last seen in early 2023 due to the recent halving, which reduced fixed block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.

The latest version of Aave boasts an improved operational fluidity because of the inclusion of a Cross-Chain Liquidity Layer (CCLL) that enables seamless asset transfers across supported chains.

Aave also announced plans to integrate Real World Assets (RWAs) with its native stablecoin, GHO, in partnership with ChainLink. The algorithmic stablecoin, introduced in July 2023, has a market valuation of $49 million, making it a minor player compared to competitors such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).

Suggestions pertaining to GHO consist of enhancements to the liquidation engine, including “soft” liquidations and variable liquidation incentives, as well as improved GHO integration, including interest-earning options.

An emergency redemption mechanism for GHO depegging scenarios was also proposed as part of the major upgrade.

The plan outlines a three-year development timeline. Aave Labs intends to connect with the community on a regular basis, including feedback sessions and annual reviews, to ensure that the project’s progress is in line with community expectations and changing market conditions.

Aave Labs has also advocated a move from a retroactive to a proactive funding model based on open budgeting and community approval prior to the project’s beginning. The planned budget comprises 15 million GHO and 25,000 stkAAVE for research, development, and security audits in the first year.

Revamped visual identity

Aave has also proposed updating its visual identity to better reflect its strategic future goals and increase brand recognition in the defi industry. The new design strives to convey a modern, distinct image that is consistent with Aave’s inventive approach.

Aave Labs welcomed broad participation from developers and community members in achieving its objectives, emphasizing that the protocol’s governance will remain decentralized. Contributors are encouraged to participate actively in discussions and development processes, thereby shaping the protocol’s future.

Following community feedback, Aave Labs intends to revise and include it in the official Aave Governance Framework before final approval. The documentation for this project is provided under the CC0 license, allowing for open collaboration and extensive contributions.

At the time of writing, AAVE was trading at $83.41, up 3.4% in the last 24 hours, per data by CoinMarketCap. However, the token dropped 8% in the previous week due to the recent decline in the global crypto market."

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on May 1 sanctioned nearly 300 individuals and entities in a bid “to limit the Kremlin’s revenue and access to the materiel it needs to prosecute its illegal war against Ukraine.” In a press release, OFAC said the sanctioned entities have enabled Russia to acquire “desperately needed technology and equipment from abroad.”

One of the sanctioned individuals appears to be a developer of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) called the OKO Design Bureau. According to a blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis, the Russian drone maker operated a Telegram channel where it solicited donations in crypto. OFAC has sanctioned three crypto addresses associated with the Saint Petersburg-registered firm:

BTC: 13fhnkmpBBWXUQucJd6efWvXdEj78DKavk.

ETH (including USDT): 0x19F8f2B0915Daa12a3f5C9CF01dF9E24D53794F7.

TRX (including USDT): TFdTr9C3BqQrzKBXqSxJfAZFTh8UwBAfSg.

Researchers at Chainalysis say that the aforementioned addresses are listed underneath detailed descriptions and videos of OKO Design Bureau’s operations on Telegram, including testing with the Russian Ministry of Defense, and “usage of their UAVs against Ukraine.”

However, OKO Design Bureau “had limited success” in their Telegram crypto donation efforts, the researchers say, adding that the firm raised well under $1,000 in total collection. Although OKO Design Bureau’s total crypto activities were limited, Chainalysis notes this is not the first time Russian militia groups explicitly detailed their military operations while publicly soliciting crypto donations.

According to the New York-headquartered blockchain firm, over 50 volunteer groups committed to crowdfunding Russian military purchases, “spreading disinformation, and creating pro-invasion propaganda.” The analysts say the organizations had received roughly $2.2 million in donations by July 2022, although it’s unclear whether that dynamic has grown or declined since then."

According to data provided by Santiment, the SOL total open interest has been consistently declining over the past 10 days — falling from $1.63 billion on April 22 to $1.35 billion at the reporting time.

The declining open interest could potentially indicate less price volatility and liquidations.

Moreover, data from the market intelligence platform shows that the ratio of long to short trading positions on Binance has been cut in half since April 29 as the SOL price continued its downward momentum. This shows more trading contracts have been betting against a price hike.

Per Santiment, the SOL Relative Strength Index (RSI) surged from 43 to 50 over the past 24 hours. The indicator suggests that the asset is neither undervalued nor overvalued at this price point due to the bearish market conditions.

For SOL to stay in the bullish zone, its RSI would need to remain below the 50 mark. An RSI of over 50 could also suggest higher price volatility and even whale manipulation.

The bullish sentiment toward SOL comes after Zeus Network announced to potentially make Solana “the Layer 2 solution for all blockchains” with ZPL (Zeus Program Library) and assets powered by the so-called permissionless communication layer.

In simple terms, users could convert assets like BTC into a ZPL-Asset, zBTC for example, and gain access to the Solana ecosystem, per the announcement."

A portion of the token supply would then be subject to a vesting schedule known as a lock-up period. During this time, investors and contributors cannot liquidate the crypto assets or sell on exchanges, although some protocols allow staking and yield generation on vested tokens.

The document “Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing” states that during the specified reporting period, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) employed more than 50 financial crime specialists who examined the activities of 238 firms. Approximately one-third were involved in overseeing the activities of crypto firms.

Peter Watts, the founder of NFT marketplace Reservoir, went on X to caution about the dangers of using hardware wallets, mentioning the risk of losing seed phrases or hastily moving assets stored in a bank’s safety deposit box, especially during unexpected events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

The conversation took a new turn when Vitalik Buterin joined it, advocating for the use of multisignature (also known as multisig) solutions for securing personal funds.

He emphasized the need for a “M-of-N” configuration, where some keys are held by the user and others by trusted individuals, without disclosing their identities even to each other.

In response to Buterin’s suggestion, Ethereum investor Tobby Kitty proposed Shamir, a backup method for splitting cryptographic keys or passwords into multiple parts called “shares.” While acknowledging the benefits of Shamir, Buterin cautioned that it’s “way easier to screw up” compared to multisig, as it depends on carefully handling and storing many parts of the secret.

Pike Finance, a decentralized finance protocol specializing in cross-chain lending, fell victim to a hacking attack, resulting in a significant loss of over $1.6 million worth of altcoins. In an X post on May 1, the project’s official account said that the Pike Beta protocol was exploited on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism, losing 99,970.48 ARB, 64,126 OP, and 479.39 ETH.

According to the Pike Finance team, the exploit is related to the “USDC vulnerability,” which previously cost the protocol $299,127 in stolen USDC across Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism. In a post-mortem report on Apr. 28, the team said that Pike Finance lost the assets “due to weak security measures in functions managing USDC transfers” via cross-chain transfer protocol.

“Specifically, the critical flaw was in functions designed for burning USDC on a source chain and minting on a target chain (automated by Gelato’s automation services). Inadequate protection of this function allowed attackers to manipulate receiver’s address and amounts, which were processed by Pike protocol as valid.” Pike Finance

This time, the vulnerability led to a “misalignment in storage mapping,” which caused the protocol’s smart contract to behave in a different way, allowing attackers to bypass admin access, and as a result, withdraw funds. The team also announced a 20% reward for the return of the funds, or to those who can provide “information leading to the recovery of funds.”

London-based financial services lawyer Rabya Anwar told crypto.news that the stories of Zhao and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried “have become interlinked” since the U.S. government took action against both in a short span of time. She explained that:

“Zhao may have mentored Bankman-Fried in the past before their relationship ruptured but the way in which these two industry leaders have conducted their respective businesses has been worlds apart. Bankman-Fried was charged with fraud, including the misappropriation of customers’ funds, which some would describe as theft. Whereas, Zhao’s case centers more around the effectiveness of anti-money laundering controls.” Award-winning financial services lawyer, Rabya Anwar, Esq., told crypto.news.

A number of factors have influenced the difference in the sentencing of these two men. Anwar points to the “difference in the nature of their conduct and, furthermore, the damaging and lasting impact of the FTX scandal on innocent members of the public.”

An executive familiar with the development was cited, stating that this was a temporary suspension. A statement from one of the affected firms cited in the report also confirmed this.

The report added that the directive came shortly after the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nigeria’s anti-graft body, blocked over 1,140 bank accounts allegedly associated with illicit foreign transactions.

Another source added that the CBN had already engaged with the affected firms prior to issuing the directive. According to the source, the CBN believes that cryptocurrency traders were “leveraging the fintech platforms to disrupt the FX market.”

A recent survey conducted by the Deutsche Bundesbank revealed that a very large majority of Germans “appear open” to the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) also known in the Europen Union as digital euro.

In a discussion paper, Germany’s central bank revealed the results of a survey, which gathered responses from approximately 6,000 participants, exploring how individuals would allocate funds in different scenarios, including “normal times” and periods of “banking stress.”

The survey found that many Germans are mainly open to CBDCs. Even without remuneration, almost half of the people said they would be okay with having digital euros. Surprisingly, they were just as interested in CBDCs as they were in using cash, even though Germans usually prefer cash, the central bank noted.

Moreover, the survey revealed a significant propensity among respondents to shift to digital euros during times of banking stress. Approximately 86% of respondents demonstrated their openness to CBDC, defined by either holding unremunerated CBDC or withdrawing to digital euros during banking stress.

Bundesbank’s study also suggests that correctly calibrated holding limits for CBDC could lead to “welfare improvements,” implying that limits would allow households to satisfy their demand for CBDC while mitigating the risk of runs during vulnerable periods.

Germany appears to be intensifying its focus on digitalization as a potential substitute for cash, as Deutsche Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel earlier reaffirmed Eurosystem’s inability to identify individuals through CBDC payments, highlighting minimal data visibility.

Speaking at the DZ Bank Capital Markets Conference 2024, Nagel emphasized that financial institutions and other payment service providers processing digital euro payments “would not be allowed to use personal and transaction-related data for commercial purposes.” He noted though that this restriction would only be lifted if users explicitly granted consent."

Jacobs was convicted of three felony counts of providing support for an act of terrorism, as well as guilty of conspiracy, money laundering and criminal possession of a weapon. In the press release, prosecutors say Jacobs sent more than $6,000 to a terrorist group called “Malhama Tactical” and laundered $12,000 by getting money from supporters worldwide through cryptocurrency and wire transfers (Western Union and MoneyGram), which was then sent to Bitcoin wallets “controlled by Malhama Tactical.”

The press release notes that Jacobs not only sent cryptocurrency but also supplied a detailed U.S. Army Improvised Munitions Handbook to an online group linked with the terrorism organization to assist in making bombs in Syria, and bought Google Play gift cards for the organization.

In a note addressed to clients, Hougan theorized that stablecoin regulations may have an even bigger impact than the largely successful spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.

“The launch of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. epitomizes this transition, but it’s not the only road marker. Others include BlackRock launching a tokenized Treasury fund on the Ethereum blockchain, Europe passing comprehensive crypto legislation, Ray Dalio calling on investors to own “non-debt money” like bitcoin, and more.” Matt Hougan, Bitwise CIO

Stars align for stablecoins in the U.S.

Hougan pointed to several indicators that suggest the U.S. Congress is closer to unveiling a framework for overseeing fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies.

The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act was recently introduced in the Senate, gathering support from lawmakers from various points on the political spectrum. However, some within the crypto industry remain skeptical about the bill’s effect on free speech due to its ban on algorithmic stablecoins.

Last week, Maxine Waters, the Ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, disclosed a deal with Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry regarding stablecoin rules.

Waters told Bloomberg that several members of the Committee were informed and leaning toward the policy, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown, who notoriously holds anti-crypto sentiment.

Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller, Federal Research Chair Jerome Powell, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have publicly expressed support for stablecoins, a sign that Washington’s approach to this particular crypto sector may have flipped.

Bipartisan interest spurred by three catalysts

According to the Bitwise CIO, three primary reasons exist for the narrative shift. First, U.S. dollar-pegged coins could solidify global USD dominance by allowing more investors access to the popular greenback currency.

Also, passing legislation would bootstrap more demand for U.S. Treasuries. Stablecoin issuers already rank 16 among the largest independent Treasuries holders worldwide.

At $120 billion in total mkt cap today, stablecoins are currently the 16th largest ""sovereign holder"" of US treasuries — which is wild considering the state of the crypto market.

Also known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship through expatriation in February 2014 and secured citizenship from St. Kitts and Nevis, per the Justice Department. At this point, Ver was supposedly required to file tax returns for capital gains from his Bitcoin-inclusive holdings and disclose the fair market value of his assets under U.S. laws.

Ver reportedly owned around 131,000 bitcoins personally and another 73,000 through MemoryDealers.com Inc. and Agilestar.com Inc. Both entities were domiciled in the U.S. and remained subject to U.S. legislation.

DOJ prosecutors alleged that Ver liquidated several thousands of Bitcoin in 2017 for an estimated $240 million but never paid capital gains or exit tax as mandated by law, despite him no longer being a U.S. citizen.

The indictment explains that the investor was still legally obligated to report certain distributions, such as company dividends for MemeoryDealers and Agilestar.

Instead, the Justice Department claimed that Ver hid his accounts from the IRS and concealed proceeds from the 2017 Bitcoin sales, with a tax bill of over $48 million due. The United States government will seek to extradite Ver following his arrest in Europe and prosecute him on American soil.

The launch plan includes allocating 45% of the 1.67 billion tokens to the community, with a third of this portion distributed through an airdrop spanning multiple seasons. The initial season will distribute 5% of the tokens in two segments, specifically rewarding those staked with the protocol.

A primary concern is the restriction on token transferability upon release.

“When the token is launched, it will be non-transferable for months,” EigenLayer explained, aiming to allow time for decentralization and build consensus on its utility and governance.

However, this limitation and the allocation of the tokens have sparked discontent, particularly among recipients of the airdrop.

The issue mirrors the controversy surrounding the Starknet airdrop in February. Tokens for investors and core contributors were initially set to be unlocked shortly after trading commenced, following a year-long vesting period that had elapsed in the background. Starknet postponed these unlocks after facing backlash.

Further criticism arose from the airdrop’s exclusion of certain countries, including the U.S. and Canada, and its block on VPN users, ostensibly due to regulatory concerns. This selective eligibility has frustrated some users, who noted inconsistencies in platform access versus airdrop participation.

Additionally, the complexity of the airdrop’s structure and its underlying concepts, such as intersubjective forking described in the whitepaper as part of the Universal Intersubjective Work Token, have been disputed.

Confusion also surfaced regarding the eligibility of Pendle users, who were initially thought to be excluded from the airdrop. The Eigen Foundation later clarified the inclusion, although Pendle’s market response remained lukewarm, with an 18% drop since the announcement, according to CoinGecko.

The report says mining has become dangerously centralized, with one organization holding the coins mined by nine major pools, controlling about 47% of the network’s hashrate.

The document refers to a publication by a user under the nickname mononaut on X. According to the user, the unnamed custodian accumulated bitcoins from AntPool, F2Pool, Binance Pool, Braiins, BTC.com, SECPOOL, and Poolin.

The same custodian controls the entry addresses of ULTIMUSPOOL and 1THash and also receives mining rewards from Luxor. Many participants in these pools provide hashrate for the AntPool transaction accelerator, which was used by a large custodian.

In an article for Bitcoin Magazine, crypto analyst Alex Bergeron pointed out the high degree of centralization of mining in the Bitcoin blockchain. Bergeron explained that the pools are trying to adjust the payout scheme and completely eliminate income deviations from the equation.

BitMEX researchers have calculated that the minimum fund of a mining pool that controls 50% of the hashrate should be at least 400 Bitcoins (BTC), giving the platform a 95% chance of survivorship within a year.

https://crypto.news/coinbase-integrates-bitcoin-lightning-network/,Coinbase integrates Bitcoin Lightning Network,2024-04-30 15:40:18+00:00,"Bralon Hill, Brian Stone","Coinbase has announced the integration of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, enabling faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions.

According to Coinbase’s blog, as of Tuesday, users can access this feature on mobile and desktop platforms and send Bitcoin via the traditional Bitcoin network or the Lightning Network.

The Lightning Network, a layer 2 protocol established in 2018, facilitates transactions off the main Bitcoin blockchain, enhancing speed and reducing costs. Coinbase’s adoption of this technology was supported by Los Angeles-based Lightspark, which was founded in 2022 and specializes in enterprise-grade Lightning Network services.

“Customers will be interacting with Lightning out of our retail exchange, and that is custodial, in the same way that you custody Bitcoin and other assets with Coinbase,” said Viktor Bunin, a protocol specialist and Lightning integration lead at Coinbase. “Customers don’t have to run a node, or manage a channel, or worry about liquidity.”

Bunin detailed the reasons for choosing Lightspark, pointing out its extensive experience implementing large-scale Lightning solutions for businesses and their adherence to stringent security standards. The integration lead also mentioned the importance of Lightspark’s non-custodial services and its ongoing dedication to developing the Lightning ecosystem.

Starting today, support for the Lightning Network via @lightspark will begin rolling out.

With an integration process that began last fall, Bunin emphasized the importance of educating Coinbase’s team on the nuances of the Lightning Network. The protocol specialist mentioned ensuring that all team members involved in the project thoroughly understood how the Lightning Network functions and its implications for their specific roles.

However, the new service is currently unavailable to residents of Canada and New York. This regional restriction reflects ongoing regulatory challenges, including a legal battle with the U.S. SEC over allegations of facilitating trades in unregistered securities, which emerged prominently in 2022.

Coinbase has also been politically active, supporting campaigns that positively influence crypto regulation. In December, a Coinbase-backed SuperPAC launched a significant ad campaign targeting U.S. Senate candidate Katie Porter, indicating the exchange’s strategic political engagements.

Coinbase’s adoption of the Lightning Network represents a step towards improving the scalability of Bitcoin transactions, aligning with its goal of increasing crypto adoption and economic freedom.

“Bitcoin is the most important asset in crypto […] Lightning just made a lot of sense,” Bunin said."

Ethereum became the leader of decentralized exchanges (DEX) in trading volumes, with a share of 37.1%. Last month, trading volume on the Ethereum network increased by 92.4%, reaching $69.67 billion.

The Solana blockchain now sits in second place with a share of 21.3% but has shown the greatest growth over the reporting period, at 244.8%, reaching $40 billion.

BNB Smart Chain is in third place, accounting for 15.1% of the total trading turnover across all DEXs. In March, its trading volume was $28.5 billion, an increase of 161.1% over the month. The blockchain finished the last reporting period with $10.9 billion.

Experts note that Ethereum’s share dropped sharply during the first quarter of 2024, falling to 33.4% as Solana and Arbitrum significantly strengthened their positions. For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Ethereum’s share was 46.8%.

“In January and February 2024, Arbitrum briefly overtook Ethereum’s dominance. Ethereum had a 31.2% and 30.1% market share in January and March, while Arbitrum stood at 39.1% and 39.7% during the same period.” CoinGecko

Trading volume itself continues to grow within the network. In the first quarter of this year, it increased by 46.8%, as calculated by CoinGecko. Solana remains the growth leader, as its trade turnover increased from $18.18 billion to $62.31 billion. Quarterly, this figure increased by 242.7%.

In March, DEXs based on Solana captured about half of the daily trading volume in the market. The segment leader was the Jupiter platform, which had $2.66 billion, followed by Raydium at $2.4 billion. The increased interest in the Solana blockchain occurred amid the hype around meme coins."

Bloomberg estimates that Binance likely generated around $9.8 billion in annual revenue for March. Despite the uncertainty surrounding Zhao’s verdict and Binance’s legal complications, the exchange’s day-to-day operations continue without significant disruption.

Investors have reported little change in the trading experience, and some say the settlement provides certainty amid continued regulatory scrutiny.

Bloomberg journalists clarify that if a Seattle judge agrees with prosecutors and orders him to be jailed, Zhao will go down in history books as the richest person ever to serve time in a U.S. federal prison due to his ownership of Binance — and the personal fortune associated with it, valued at $43 billion, will remain untouched.

Zhao’s wealth is expected to grow as Binance’s business accelerates amid the latest cryptocurrency bull run. Despite giving the CEO title as part of a deal with the government, the Binance founder’s continued influence over the company is hard to ignore.

Additionally, the agency notes that traders view Binance and Zhao differently from its former arch-rival FTX, which went bankrupt after founder Sam Bankman-Fried misappropriated billions of dollars worth of users’ cryptocurrencies.

The most obvious change is that Zhao has recused himself from his role as the company’s public face. Although he was never one to mingle with celebrities or invite reporters to his home, as FTX‘s Bankman-Fried did, Zhao kept a low profile after pleading guilty.

In November 2023, Changpeng Zhao resigned as CEO of Binance as part of a multi-year case. U.S. regulators accused the company of allowing transactions with clients from sanctioned jurisdictions. The entrepreneur admitted guilt and agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice. Binance agreed to pay fines totaling $4.3 billion to settle the authorities’ claims, and Zhao will personally pay $50 million.

With the new update, Omnity reduces network congestion, supporting the evolution of the Bitcoin network towards serving broader economic functions.

At launch, Omnity provides core functionality for Runes tokens, including transferring them between chains. This is achieved through introducing a twin token, which ensures that the integrity and functionality of Runes assets are maintained across different chains.

You can expect to see some of these features brought to the ICP and Bitcoin community via Omnity to enrich the Bitcoin defi environment in the coming months.” The Omnity team

The Runes protocol was developed by Casey Rodarmor, who created the Ordinals concept in early 2023. The new project uses the Bitcoin UTXO model to offer a more efficient solution for network tokenization than the BRC20 standard.

A few days after its release, the Runes protocol received 2,129 BTC in fees, the equivalent of $135.6 million. Record revenue from fees on halving day has led some to speculate that the network is moving toward paying miners mostly through transactional activity.

50% of the participants believe that cryptocurrencies will become a mainstream investment vehicle within the next five years. Interestingly, the majority of these participants (59%) prefer making decisions independently, with only 5% seeking advice from investment managers.

In line with this, the survey revealed that 70% of the respondents with investments in crypto make their financial decisions independently.

The core motivation behind cryptocurrency investing was touted to be wealth appreciation. 72% of the crypto-invested users echoed this sentiment. The metric was higher than the 63% of traditional investors that eye economic benefit, indicating that cryptocurrencies continue to be perceived as a speculative sector primarily utilized for monetary gains.

A viral video from the Mollars project founder raises critical questions about Bitcoin’s financial ethics and Satoshi Nakamoto, sparking widespread discussions.

In the midst of the wild fluctuations and dramatic developments in the crypto market today, a new animated video has gone viral, capturing the attention of both enthusiasts and investors. The video, released by the founder of the Mollars project, has sparked widespread discussion over the 1 million Bitcoins Satoshi Nakamoto has in his ‘stash’ wallet.

In the 30-second animated video, the Mollar token creator points out how certain investors will lose money each time Bitcoin founder Satoshi sells one of his ‘stashed’ BTC. He continues, asking where the money to pay for Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1 million Bitcoins will come from.

“Every time you cash out those free tokens somebody has to lose. Doesn’t that bother you guys?” asks the animated character of Mollars token’s founder in the now controversial video.

In a frank dialogue, the video also clarifies the financial ethics behind the Mollars project.

“We get paid to create this project but no tokens will be held free,” he says in a reply to an animated version of Ryoshi from Shiba Inu (SHIB) token.

Mollars is an up-and-coming project set to launch on the Ethereum blockchain in May. The price of the cryptocurrency during its ICO stage is $0.55 cents per token with experts forecasting huge jumps in value.

Those familiar with the brand’s whitepaper understand that the presale tokenomics includes funding the professionals involved with Mollars. Most importantly, it is specified that no person will get free tokens following this phase. The reward for the founder, developers, and marketers involved with the MOLLARS token will simply be credit for creating an SOV asset to rival Bitcoin.

Interestingly, the Mollars founder, who remains an enigma just as Satoshi Nakamoto, has been watching the path of the BTC founder with great detail. Earlier they called out Satoshi for having kept secret wallets with 1 million of Bitcoin’s 21-million total minted supply for himself, indirectly calling the token a ‘farce’ in terms of decentralization.

The creator of the new SOV token also cited sources from credible auditors to back up claims, which were captured in several news stories.

Launched with the aim of ‘true decentralization,’ Mollars is designed to address perceived flaws in Bitcoin by offering a store-of-value asset on a scalable blockchain with 80% lower transaction fees for buying, selling, and converting.

Critics of Bitcoin highlight its high costs and limited scalability, arguing it’s not yet suitable for real-world commercial transactions. In contrast, Mollars has gained traction among investors, raising over $1.2 million in its ICO presale, with 2.6 million tokens. Over 66% of the available ICO supply has already been acquired by traders."

According to local reports, the ED teamed up with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and arrested two individuals involved in the operation. The investigation was initially launched in 2023, but the arrests were made last week following a tip from the FBI to the ED.

The two individuals, Parvinder Singh and Banmeet Singh from Haldwani, in the state of Uttarakhand, were apprehended on April 27 following raids conducted by local law enforcement.

The accused allegedly ran their operations via dark web marketplaces like Silk Road 1, AlphaBay, and Hansa, along with online advertisements to promote the illicit sales of drugs. They even established a network of distributors and distribution cells and facilitated payments via various cryptocurrencies.

The funds were then laundered via multiple cryptocurrency wallets.

The FBI has already recovered INR 1500 (approx $180 million) crore worth of digital currencies linked to the case. The ED has also confiscated crucial documents related to the operation.

This isn’t the only illicit operation involving cryptocurrencies uncovered by the ED in April. Per an April 19 report, the ED probed Raj Kundra, a prominent businessman and husband of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, for his alleged involvement in a $800 million Ponzi scheme.

The scheme, dubbed ‘Gain Bitcoin,’ was launched in 2017 and promised investors a return of 10% per month, payable in Bitcoin.

These scams are a part of the growing cases of illicit crypto use in the nation. In March 2024, the ED filed charge sheets against 299 entities under India’s anti-money laundering laws. The charges came in response to fraud involving fake crypto-mining ventures.

To mitigate such risks, the regulators in India have also issued compliance notices to several cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the nation in line with the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)."

In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Yimei Li, CEO of China Asset Management, mentioned that the Tuesday launch of the spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs “opens the door for numerous RMB [Chinese yuan] holders” looking for alternative investments.

China Asset Management is one of three ETF issuers, together with Harvest Global Investments and Bosera Asset Management, that introduced a cryptocurrency product on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on April 30.

Li told Bloomberg TV that she believed a “new opportunity” for mainland Chinese investors to “participate in this process” will arise in the future.

She emphasized the potential expansion of asset options for domestic investors as market accessibility improves.

Crypto trading is still prohibited in mainland China, and the new ETFs are only available to Hong Kong residents at the time.

Han Tongli, CEO of Harvest Global, mentioned that regulators are closely observing the development of these ETFs to manage potential risks and may consider market expansion based on risk assessments.

In an April 30 post on X, Jan. 3 CEO and Bitcoin pioneer Samson Mow stated that ETFs in Hong Kong “are going to be big,” with “long-term implications that are massive.”

“There is really nothing else for Chinese investors to put their money into at this time.”

The comments follow a post by Bitcoin environmentalist Daniel Batten, who noted the decline of all three Chinese stock exchanges in 2023 and the ongoing instability in the real estate market.

Per Barron’s report last week, all major Chinese real estate data indicators performed poorly or declined during the first quarter.

Most Chinese ultra-high-net-worth individuals can invest in Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency ETFs, he said.

At a press conference on April 29, Zhu Haokang from China Asset Management confirmed that, as of now, mainland Chinese investors are prohibited from investing in the new Hong Kong ETFs.

“Hong Kong’s qualified investors, institutional investors, retail investors, and international investors who meet the regulations can all invest in cryptocurrency spot ETFs,” he said.

Fund issuers and investors anticipate that this will spark a new wave of capital inflows from the mainland in the future.

Despite the impending debut of the Hong Kong crypto spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), crypto markets were down across the board on Tuesday morning, with Bitcoin (BTC) hovering above $63,000 as investor excitement remained muted.

Most altcoin majors also lost their weekend gains, with ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), and dogecoin (DOGE) falling from 4% to 6%.

Even though spot-based bitcoin and ether ETFs in Hong Kong will begin trading at local times on Tuesday morning, the upcoming launch has not generated the same level of excitement as the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. Notably, BTC roughly doubled in price in the three months preceding its January 11 debut, and large inflows helped push BTC above $73,000 in March.

Defying the subdued anticipation, an executive of ChinaAMC, one of the three issuers of the new Hong Kong-listed spot ETFs, reportedly stated during a press briefing that the first-day sale of shares might exceed the $125 million debut in the United States, alluding to the new products’ initial funding.

Analysts at Coinbase Research noted in a research report that following the halving, the coordinated release of Runes on Bitcoin, an alternative to the BRC-20 protocol, resulted in “an all-time high of $81 million spent on transaction fees in one day.” The analysts say the increase in variable transaction fees in conjunction with the BTC rally during Q1 “could support the continued growth of network hash rate for some time,” suggesting miners may find it profitable to continue participating in BTC mining at current price levels.

Bitcoin underwent its fourth halving on Apr. 20 after its 840,000th block was mined. The network is programmed to undergo halvings every 210,000 blocks, reducing the block reward by half each time. This event is considered by the crypto community as significant as it affects the supply of new Bitcoins entering circulation.

Historically, Bitcoin’s price has experienced significant movements around halving events, with some investors anticipating a price increase due to the recent reduction in supply. However, the latest upgrade occurred in a different context, as Bitcoin reached a new all-time high even before the halving took place, leading some to argue that the landscape has evolved compared to previous cycles."

The details of Zhao’s talks with Altman remain slim, with the sources only saying that the former Binance head is particularly interested in artificial intelligence. According to the report, Zhao first met Altman in 2023, before stepping down as a chief executive at Binance. After changes in leadership at OpenAI in late November, the people said Zhao and Altman held another round of talks.

In December 2023, Zhao confirmed during a meeting with Ronghui Gu, a computer science professor at Columbia University, that he had communicated with Altman. In an interview with the New York Times, Gu said that Zhao and Altman both “believe that A.I. is going to help a lot in actualizing the development of technology and human knowledge.”

Gu also added that the Binance founder mentioned that he was “looking for opportunities” to invest in the large data centers that power AI applications, though Zhao’s preferred investment target — OpenAI or its rivals — remains unclear.

Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.

In an X post in November, Zhao publicly talked about his plans after his legal issues, mentioning his interest in investing in web3, decentralized finance, and artificial intelligence.

“After that, my current thinking is I will probably do some passive investing, being a minority token/shareholder in startups in areas of blockchain/Web3/DeFi, AI and biotech.” Changpeng Zhao

Meanwhile, U.S. prosecutors seek a 36-month prison sentence for Zhao, citing the severity of his alleged crimes. They argue that such a punishment would deter Zhao and others from flouting U.S. laws for financial gain. Zhao, who pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act in November 2023, currently awaits sentencing, scheduled for Apr. 30. Despite being free on a $175 million bond, his request to travel to Dubai was denied by a U.S. judge due to concerns about his substantial wealth and potential flight risk."

The latest surge comes at a time when the broader cryptocurrency sector is facing a downturn, highlighting Helium’s significant gains. Currently, Helium boasts a market capitalization of approximately $943 million, securing the 86th position in global cryptocurrency rankings by market cap as per data by CoinMarketCap.

HNT’s trading volume has soared by 16.92% over the last 24 hours, totaling $67,734,559. In the same timeframe, HNT has traded between a low of $5.1063 and a high of $6.0536, showcasing the token’s strong performance amidst the market downturn.

Founded in July 2019, Helium facilitates communication among low-powered wireless devices through its decentralized network, leveraging a comprehensive system of nodes for robust data transmission and connectivity across IoT devices.

The latest price surge in HNT follows an announcement from the Helium Foundation, which reported mixed outcomes in its latest voting results.

Per the update, the proposal for HNT failed due to insufficient voter turnout, while the IOT and MOBILE proposals passed with over 91% approval. Notably, HIP 112, which proposed scaling IoT hotspot assert fees, failed with only 42.52% approval. In contrast, HIP 117, aimed at adding MNTD as a hotspot vendor for Helium’s MOBILE subNetwork, received a robust 93.88% approval.

A re-vote for the HNT proposal is scheduled, reflecting the ongoing governance activities within the Helium community.

Meanwhile, Arman Dezfuli-Arjomandi, a board member of the nonprofit Helium Foundation, linked the price rise to significant updates in Helium’s mobile sector in an X post on April 29.

He noted that since the beginning of the year, the network has gained 62,463 subscribers to its unlimited plans, resulting in the daily burning of nearly $3,000 worth of HNT due to data usage on Wi-Fi hotspots.

The network has also started preliminary integration testing with major players like AT&T, which boasts 223 million subscribers, and Google Orion for data offload.

Other initiatives include the launch of $20 monthly business group plans, a subscriber store for purchasing Hotspots and Pixel phones with MOBILE, and the introduction of international roaming add-ons.

Furthermore, Helium has initiated a new discovery mapping feature, improved user experience, anti-gaming measures, and the launch of Helium Free Wi-Fi, which benefits local businesses while attracting new customers.

The availability of SIM cards on Amazon and targeted advertising on the Solana podcast underscores Helium’s efforts to integrate more users into the crypto ecosystem, offering three months of free service as an incentive.

Arjomandi concluded that these strategic moves are designed to attract non-crypto natives by providing practical crypto experiences, further bolstered by Helium’s status as one of the largest hosted Solana wallet providers.

The decentralized exchange (DEX) accounts for around 37% of the total trading volume on layer 2 while running atop crypto’s second-largest blockchain, Ethereum (ETH).

21.co researcher Tom Wan noted that the platform’s L2 volumes experienced more than 650% growth in 24 months, increasing from around $4 billion in 2022 to over $30 billion this year. The analysts added that this trend could strengthen even further if more quality protocols launch on layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Coinbase’s Base, and Optimism.

“L2s have been gaining more economic activities, specifically Base and Arbitrum, which account for 82% of the total L2 volume on Uniswap. I would expect the dominance of L2s’ volume on Uniswap will continue to grow to 50% by the end of this year.” Tom Wan, 21.co researcher

Data showed that the exchange has only contributed 2.9% of the total volume on altcoin L1s, but Wan opined that this narrative may see a shift in the future. Wan explained that high-performance EVM-compatible L1s combined with a multichain expansion strategy could allow the DEX to capture more volume on networks like Sei and Monad.

The native token, dubbed EIGEN, will debut with a total supply of 1.67 billion, and the Eigen Foundation will manage the rollout scheduled for next month. According to an April 29 blog post from Eigen Labs, 45% of this supply is designated for distribution.

EigenLayer distribution plan

The first category, labeled stakedrops, carries a 15% allocation and will reward stakers for locking up Ethereum (ETH) on EigenLayer’s protocol. Per DefiLlama, users have stashed over $15.7 billion in the ETH restaking platform since its launch last June.

Furthermore, the airdrop distribution will happen in two batches. The first batch, or season one, will share 5% of the total 15% stakedrop allocation based on a linear calculation factoring in the amount staked, time staked, and native restaking, to name a few.

A snapshot for season one was taken on March 15, and eligible users can claim 90% of the airdrop by May 10. Season two will begin a month later, allowing stakers to collect the remaining 10% of the total 15% stakedrop allocation.

Today the @eigenfoundation introduces EIGEN, based on research by @eigen_labs, alongside a Season 1 Stakedrop.



EIGEN is the Universal Intersubjective Work Token, complementing ETH as the Universal Objective Work Token in EigenLayer.

Additionally, EigenLayer will allow a 120-day window for season one claimants. The EIGEN token will be non-transferable at launch to promote community participation in governance. Still, eligible users can stake a share to secure EigenDA, a data availability solution released as a complementary layer to the restaking protocol.

The two other user categories in the platform’s distribution plan included 15% allocations earmarked for community initiatives and ecosystem developments, respectively.

Early contributors will receive 25.5% of EIGEN’s total supply, while investors have rights to 29.5%. Both parties will have a three-year vesting schedule, and 4% of the holdings will unlock monthly over the last two years.

Introducing inter-subjective forking

EigenLayer is also set to introduce inter-subjective forking to tackle patterns that may escape instant on-chain detection. The crypto-economic security concept will bolster ETH restaking and address subjective faults to simplify activity for validators dealing with restaking transactions.

“I am very confident that the trading scale of the Hong Kong virtual asset spot ETF on the first day of listing can exceed that of the United States,” said Zhu Haokang, head of digital asset management and family wealth at Huaxia.

The U.S. saw a first-day trading volume of $125 million across ten Bitcoin spot ETF issuers earlier this year, a figure Hong Kong aims to surpass.

The ETFs will feature unique elements not present in U.S. counterparts, such as in-kind redemptions and subscriptions and the ability to handle transactions in multiple currencies, including Hong Kong dollars, U.S. dollars, and RMB. Moreover, the ETFs will enable wallet-to-wallet transfers, enhancing their appeal to a global audience.

OSL ETF Project Lead Wayne Huang highlighted the robust regulatory framework in Hong Kong that supports these initiatives.

“Hong Kong can be the first in the world to launch an Ethereum spot ETF,” Huang explained, emphasizing the clear and established guidelines from the China Securities Regulatory Commission regarding classifying cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) as non-securities.

Despite advancements, mainland Chinese investors are currently excluded from participating in these ETFs, though international, institutional, and retail investors from Hong Kong and other regions are eligible.

The Hong Kong market’s approach, particularly its operational processes, such as physical subscriptions and rigorous anti-money laundering measures, sets a new benchmark in the cryptocurrency ETF domain.

“Physical subscription is a pioneering initiative for Hong Kong ETFs,” said Huang, detailing the steps required for investors to transfer their digital assets securely through approved brokerage firms."

Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) has surpassed its largest competitor, Tether (USDT), in transaction volume this year, according to data from payment giant Visa and blockchain analytics platform Allium Labs.

Visa metrics show that USDC transaction volume was $455.5 billion last week, as USDT barely exceeded $88.5 billion.

Since the beginning of 2024, USD Coin has accounted for about 50% of the total volume of transfers in the stablecoin market. Previously, the leading position was always occupied by USDT, the largest stablecoin by capitalization. According to DefiLlama, the market share of Tether’s stablecoin is estimated at 69%. However, USDC performance hints at a possible shift in user sentiment.

As Bloomberg writes, citing cryptocurrency analyst Noelle Acheson, the change in the balance of power may be explained by the fact that USDT is used more outside the U.S. as a dollar store of value, while USDC is used in the country for regular transactions.

“USDT is more held outside the US as a dollar-based store of value, while the USDC is used in the US as a transaction currency.” Noelle Acheson, cryptocurrency analyst

Last week, Stripe, the online payments leader, reintroduced cryptocurrency transfers. The platform began accepting USDC on three networks: Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon.

Additionally, issuer Circle has also joined the largest asset manager, BlackRock. The latter launched its first tokenized fund at the end of March. With the cooperation of the companies, the fund’s clients could convert BUIDL into USDC on the secondary market."

As The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports, citing official documents, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall asked the Biden administration several clarifying questions related to Russia, Iran, and North Korea’s possible use of the USDT stablecoin.

According to the document, the stablecoin USDT, backed by the U.S. dollar, allowed Russian companies to bypass sanctions and purchase components for drones and other equipment abroad.

Because of this development, senators asked whether the Department of Defense and the Joe Biden administration support the Treasury Department’s request for new powers.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) comprised the lion’s share of exits, with $423 million and $38 million, respectively. The bulk of this pattern, primarily found in BTC, was recorded in the U.S. and mostly domiciled in Grayscale’s converted GBTC ETF.

The document states that the Ethereum 2.0 investigation was based on the SEC’s belief that possible offers and sales of certain securities, including but not limited to ETH, had occurred since at least 2018.

The Consensys lawsuit shows that the SEC has made multiple document requests over the past year asking for more details about the company’s role in the proof-of-stake (PoS) update and its acquisitions, holdings, and sales of Ethereum. Documents also show that the SEC may believe that sales of Ethereum even before the 2018 merger were securities.

The SEC’s belief that Ethereum is a security contradicts the previous guidance under the chairmanship of Jay Clayton. Additionally, in June of 2018, then-CFO Bill Hinman stated in a speech the SEC’s position that Ethereum, along with Bitcoin, is not a security.

Even before Gensler’s testimony, the chairman’s reluctance to give a definitive answer on Ethereum’s regulatory status raised alarm bells for the crypto industry. Many speculate that Ethereum’s Merge has made the cryptocurrency more security-like than the original consensus mechanism.

Consensys initiated legal action against the SEC to keep the regulator from overseeing the Ethereum blockchain.

Consensys said its action against the SEC followed the April 10 Wells notice indicating the regulator was preparing to take enforcement action against the company regarding its MetaMask wallet services.

The unit comprises 30 experts from seven different financial and taxation authorities and was launched last July as the nation’s first body focusing solely on digital asset-related crimes.

South Korea has witnessed a significant increase in crypto crimes over the past year. Per a February report for the nation’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), 16,076 suspicious transitions were flagged by the watchdog. The FIU said the number of crimes increased by 48.8% since 2022.

The transactions were linked to a multitude of illicit activities, including money laundering, market manipulation, and illegal drug trades.

The primary driver for the growth was attributed to the FIU’s engagement with local cryptocurrency service providers, urging these entities to report suspicious activities. The efforts also led to a 90% increase in crypto cases forwarded to law enforcement for investigation.

One of the latest cases where law enforcement intervened saw the Haeundae Police Station in Busan, South Korea, arresting two scammers responsible for stealing 5.5 billion won, the equivalent of $4.1 million, in the name of cryptocurrency investments. The scammers guaranteed 70% earnings for a monthly investment of 1 billion won.

As of press time, the reason for the removal remains unclear, and neither Trust Wallet nor Google Play has issued any public statements on the matter. Shortly after the news broke, Trust Wallet’s native token TWT plunged by over 5%, according to data from CoinGecko.

Trust Wallet, established in 2017 by Viktor Radchenko, provides users with non-custodial storage services for cryptocurrency across various blockchain networks. The application was later acquired by the crypto exchange Binance in 2018, though the financial side of the deal remains undisclosed thus far.

The latest news emerged shortly after the FBI warned Americans to avoid using crypto services from companies not registered as Money Services Businesses (MSBs) and not following anti-money laundering rules. It’s unclear if Google’s decision to remove Trust Wallet is connected to this warning, as other non-custodial crypto wallets remain available on Google Play at the time of writing."

According to Mpumelelo Ndamane, CEO of South Africa-based crypto wallet provider Nuud Money, the elections will steer clear of cryptocurrencies.

“We’ve been pretty stable over the past 30 years when it comes to ensuring the [South African Reserve Bank] and FSCA are independent of politics. It won’t affect the crypto policy.”

Meanwhile, according to John McCarthy, general counsel for global regulatory affairs at Fireblocks, most of the development around the digital asset sector in South Africa has been done to address problems that are “apolitical” in nature. As such, McCarthy voiced a similar opinion to that of Ndamane, pointing out that the apolitical nature of the issues has resulted in the approach being similar as well.

“It’s also been through an intergovernmental working body, much of which is inherently apolitical,” he added.

As reported earlier by crypto.news, the nation’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) is set to issue licenses to 60 digital asset platforms. The commission has set a deadline of November 30 for exchanges to apply.

The licensing framework, a significant step in the regulatory developments, was the result of the regulators including cryptocurrencies with the nation’s Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act in 2022. At the time of publication, the nation had already licensed three exchanges, namely, VALR, Luno, and Zignaly.

Maurice Crespi, a partner at South Africa-based law firm Schindlers Attorneys, considers this “a forward-thinking approach” in a bid to regulate the digital asset space. In a statement, Crespi noted that the move is in line with global trends and acknowledges the “growing significance” of blockchain tech in current-day finance,

Runecoin is based on the Runes Protocol and was initially distributed as a Pre-Rune airdrop to early Ordinals adopters. With a total supply of 21 billion tokens, Runecoin echoes the well-known maximum supply of Bitcoin, which is capped at 21 million tokens.

This event marks the first time a Bitcoin rune has been included on a major exchange, broadening Runecoin’s visibility and potentially enhancing the engagement and understanding of Ordinals and Runes within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

According to the distribution strategy outlined by the platform, 92.00% of the Runecoin total token supply is allocated for airdrops. The team retains 5.00%, while 1.75% is designated for OKX Jumpstart participants, and 1.25% is earmarked for liquidity purposes. Participants in the BTC staking pool have the opportunity to mine 367,500,000 Runecoin tokens.

Participants can deposit BTC into their funding accounts on the OKX application, navigate to the Grow section to access Jumpstart, and use the “Stake” button to begin mining.

After the event, they can select “Unstake” to retrieve their BTC, which will automatically return to their funding account. If the unstaking process is not completed by the end of the event, the tokens will still be distributed to the users’ accounts.

Runecoin also disclosed its partnership with OKC Jumpstart in an X post dated April 29. The platform described it as a watershed moment for the community and “a significant step forward for the entire Runes ecosystem.”

In a commentary to the media outlet, a spokesperson for the Odate-based dog society said the decision to utilize blockchain came after its overseas membership increased from about 300 people in 2022 to around 500 in 2023.

In an April 28 X post, Sun weighed in on the subject, adding:

“The crypto industry still needs to prepare for a long-term education with regulators, focusing on helping them understand crypto. But we’ve always been here, haven’t we?”

According to a Reuters report, U.S. financial firms do not expect spot Ethereum ETF approval to happen in May, citing discouraging meetings with the watchdog in recent weeks.

So far, Blackrock, VanEck, ARK Investment Management, and six other issuers have filed with the SEC to list spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC is required to make decisions on VanEck’s and ARK’s files, which are first in line, by May 23 and May 24, respectively, according to the report.

Meanwhile, Sun is no stranger to dealing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC recently sued Sun on claims of fraud, market manipulation, and airdropping unregistered securities.

According to the SEC lawsuit, Sun and the aforementioned crypto businesses violated federal securities laws by offering and selling unregistered securities such as Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT).

The investors have voiced frustration over money being “stuck” during withdrawal processes, contrasting with smooth deposit transactions.

Efforts by Beribit staff to leave through alternative exits were obstructed by the irate investors, prompting police intervention.

On April 26, Beribit’s official Telegram channel announced that following recent management changes at the exchange, a series of balance sheet discrepancies were discovered, forcing the company to institute a thorough audit process.

According to the exchange, clients were also required to undergo KYC/AML verification processes, which it claims has caused a temporary backlog of requests for deposits and withdrawals.

Beribit also clarified that clients who successfully pass the KYC/AML audit and verification will get back unrestricted access to use their accounts.

Amidst this tumultuous episode, a bill has reportedly been tabled in the State Duma proposing a ban on crypto exchange operations. The bill, if passed, would not affect crypto transactions or registered mining entities. Additionally, it includes a prohibition on cryptocurrency advertising.

Conversely, another legislator argued that banning exchanges could jeopardize Russia’s national security, highlighting cryptocurrency’s role in procuring weapons and defense assets from non-Western sources and circumventing sanctions.

The Cheyenne, Wyoming-based bank is seeking a federal-level appeals court’s review of a decision by Judge Scott Skavdahl, who dismissed Custodia’s request for a Federal Reserve master account in the U.S.

A master account gives banks access to Federal Reserve services (i.e., the Automated Clearing House network for electronic payments).

Additionally, Custodia is appealing a bill of costs submitted by one of the defendants, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The bill amounts to $25,728.25 for deposition transcripts.

Custodia argues that the decision on costs should be postponed until after the appeal is concluded, referencing a similar case where costs were not imposed at such an early stage.

On March 29, the court found that Custodia Bank was not entitled to a Fed master account and rejected a writ of mandamus, which would have required the Kansas Fed to deliberate on its application. Custodia’s petition was later dismissed for review.

The court concluded that banks are not legally entitled to master accounts simply because they can apply for them. It also determined that Custodia could not prove that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors made a final decision on the denial.

The court also ruled that it lacked jurisdiction over Custodia’s complaint due to the lack of a final decision.

Custodia Bank, known for its specialization in crypto services and lack of FDIC insurance, contended that the Federal Reserve’s prolonged delay and eventual denial of its application were arbitrary and violated the Administrative Procedure Act.

The act oversees the processes federal agencies must follow in rule-making and enforcement.

Following the court order, Custodia CEO Caitlin Long told FOX Business that the bank would appeal the decision.

Long also argued that previous decisions have given the Federal Reserve “unfettered discretion” to deny new master accounts and shut current ones. She further stated that Custodia was not the only bank impacted by such a denial of access.

As crypto.news reported earlier, on Nov. 7, Long announced the launch of Custodia’s Bitcoin custody platform after gaining approval from the Wyoming Division of Banking.

Rodriguez and Hill accusing them of aiding illegal transactions through Samourai. Per the indictment, Rodriguez faces up to 20 years in prison, while Hill could face up to five years if convicted.

The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that Samourai’s creators allowed over $2 billion in unlawful transactions through the platform, collecting more than $4.5 million in fees since 2015. It also claims that Samourai was marketed as a tool for censorship resistance and facilitating illicit activities.

The arrest of Rodriguez was accompanied by a warning from the FBI to users about ‘operations’ on unregistered crypto firms believed to be money services businesses. This crackdown follows a pattern of U.S. authorities targeting wallets and mixers involved in what they deem to be questionable activities.

The indictments have provoked an outcry from the crypto community, with CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju coming to the defense of Rodriguez and Hill, arguing that privacy protection is a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin.

The borrower can use these funds as needed and normally pays interest only on the amount borrowed.

According to Kryptowaluty, the use of cryptocurrency ETFs for lending and as collateral in brokerage activities would likely continue unaffected, dependent on the risk tolerance of individual brokers.

“I am hellbent on transforming Yuga and getting us back to our roots, and that means making hard decisions.” Greg Solano, Yuga Labs Co-Founder and CEO

In a message to the team, Solano noted that Yuga Labs had lost its way and that it intends to create a smaller, more flexible, and crypto-focused team with the restructuring.

“The creative-first spirit that dove this company from inception has been getting muddied by labyrinthine corporate processes. We work hard and we care but somehow end up with groups and committees. We plan more than we ship.” Greg Solano, Yuga Labs Co-Founder and CEO

Solano noted that some of the company’s plans have already begun to be implemented. Yuga’s CEO stated that Farawaygg, the web3 game development firm that Yuga used to develop its Dookey Dash game and which recently acquired web3 games HV-MTL and Legends of the Mara, will allow Yuga to focus on creating 3D Otherside games.

On Feb. 21, Solano thanked former Yuga CEO Daniel Alegre and announced that he would take over his post. In the message, he added that he is “reinvigorated to be taking the reins for our next chapter” in the startup’s story.

In October 2023, Yuga Labs announced it was laying off employees from its U.S. team as part of a broader restructuring. The company decided to focus its force on developing Otherside, a gaming metaverse."

According to a Dune Analytics dashboard, the Runes protocol on Bitcoin (BTC) has raked in $135 million in transaction fees on the cryptocurrency’s largest blockchain. On-chain data showed that tokens issued under the standard generated more than 2,100 BTC costs within a week.

Casey Rodarmor, the same mind behind the Ordinals protocol, developed Bitcoin Runes to improve the BRC-20 standard, which is touted to bootstrap defi on BTC’s network.

Runes allows users to execute more efficient transactions and mint better-optimized tokens on BTC by tapping BTC’s UTXO format. The concept launched during the halving and has become a source of on-chain BTC activity ever since.

Per Bitcoin Wallet Unisat, users have minted nearly 11,000 Runes, a flurry of blockchain participation that skyrocketed BTC gas fees shortly after the halving. However, fees have retraced in the days after Bitcoin’s quadrennial code switch, which cut block mining rewards by 50%.

Analysts: Bitcoin Runes may benefit network long-term

Shipped at a block height of 840,000, Bitcoin Runes initially caused a surge in BTC transaction costs, but analysts do not expect this effect to remain in the long run. Bitcoin researcher Jade ARdinals shared with crypto.news that the additional load on BTC’s network was only caused by the token creation aspect, otherwise known as minting.

The researcher explained that speculation around Runes triggered mass minting, adding an “artificial” burden on BTC block space. Analysts believe this pressure will subside but maintain that the Runes standard will attract more developers to Bitcoin.

“Speaking broadly, the adoption of Runes has a generally positive long-term impact on the network, and the hype around their minting through airdrops will fade as the most sought-after tokens launched during the halving are minted out.” Jade ARdinals on Runes

Runes have already captured a chunk of BTC’s on-chain activity. Crypto Koryo’s Dune dashboard reported that Runes tokens accounted for 45% of all Bitcoin transactions on April 25."

In the review, Deaton highlights the urgent need for legal clarity regarding digital assets, highlighting the U.S. SEC’s inconsistent approach to regulation and its detrimental impact on industry participants.

As evidence, the lawyer cites court cases such as Ripple, LBRY, and Telegram, as well as previous SEC statements on cryptocurrency and letters from various regulators and legislators expressing concerns about the regulator’s actions, Terrett noted.

Deaton criticized the SEC’s lack of consistency, including its changing stance on whether crypto tokens are themselves securities.

“Bitcoin is certainly distinguishable from other cryptocurrencies but claiming it’s not a security unlike other tokens because it doesn’t have an ecosystem, is just plain dumb.” John Deaton, pro-crypto lawyer and Massachusetts Senate candidate

Deaton has been involved in cryptocurrency-related lawsuits, including filing a 2021 petition challenging the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, a security. Deaton announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate earlier this year and criticized SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s handling of the crypto industry.

Coinbase filed an appeal in two courts in April to challenge part of its ongoing litigation with the SEC. The company asked a higher court to consider whether a digital asset transaction that does not impose any obligations to the original issuer of the asset should be considered an investment contract, which would be regulated by the SEC."

In the realm of institutional investments, the concept of real-world assets (RWAs) has been gaining traction, prompting discussions on its future trajectory during influential market events like the recent Bitcoin halving.

Regarding the impact of the halving on RWA investments, Recuero emphasized that while there might not be a direct effect, historical patterns suggest an indirect correlation.

“The halving has traditionally preceded the hype season of every cycle, increasing focus, attention, and capital directed at the space,” he said.

Recuero highlighted Maker DAO as a notable player, attributing its longevity and prominence in the space. Additionally, he mentioned other successful assets such as Backed, Centrifuge, Mountain Protocol, and the BUIDL fund by Blackrock, signifying a diverse landscape of winning ventures within the RWA sphere.

Recuero expressed a cautious outlook regarding a timeline for mainstream adoption of RWAs, estimating a timeframe spanning years to a decade. The Kinto CEO elaborated on the current predominant use case around access to tokenized U.S. treasuries, citing products like the BUIDL fund, Mountain USDM, and Maker as facilitators of on-chain access to short-term treasury bills.

However, Recuero noted that broader applications like home equity loans or tokenized equities may necessitate a more protracted adoption period.

Recuero anticipated short-term attention and flowed towards ETFs by institutional entities because of the recent halving, with a more substantial impact over the medium-to-long term.

“The halving affects supply at the margin, and it should create the base for the next bull market,” he said, indicating a structural shift in market dynamics with potential ramifications for various investment vehicles.

Recuero’s insights provide a nuanced perspective on the evolving landscape of RWAs, navigating the intersections of market cycles, institutional interests, and technological innovation.

As RWAs continue to garner attention and investment, the journey toward mainstream adoption remains a dynamic narrative shaped by diverse factors and stakeholders."

Since its genesis block in July 2015, crypto’s second-largest blockchain, Ethereum, adopted a PoW consensus mechanism similar to Bitcoin (BTC). Miners were key players under this model, contributing to network security and ETH emissions to allow new tokens to enter circulation.

This changed after “The Merge” in September 2022 when Ethereum moved to a proof-of-stake (PoS) infrastructure, replacing miners with stakers in a massive technological overhaul.

Due to the PoS transition, proponents were divided. Some decried a switch in ETH’s fundamental ethos, while a group led by Chinese miner Chandler Guo even banded together to maintain a version of Ethereum’s PoW chain.

The initiative dissolved its core team to adopt complete autonomy, but the project struggled to gain traction. As of April 26, the ETHW native cryptocurrency changed hands under $4 per CoinMarketCap.

Additionally, internal communications revealed that Ripple has introduced minimum asset requirements for ODL clients with a threshold of $5 million to ensure financial sustainability. Exceptions are made for sophisticated organizations, reflecting Ripple’s commitment to protecting end customers in the face of regulatory challenges.

Moon Lambo also suggests that ODL transactions can continue unimpeded as long as they do not involve U.S. jurisdiction.

Following the SEC order in 2021, Ripple has taken steps to transition every ODL customer in the U.S. from using XRP to an intermediary currency, in this case, USDT.

In a letter of grave concern to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, the US senators have specifically requested the DOJ and DHS to transparently disclose their technical capacity to counter the use of cryptocurrencies in the CSAM market.

“Existing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules and law enforcement methods face challenges in effectively detecting and preventing these crimes,” the letter read.

The senators cited research from analytics firm Chainalysis as a foundation for their concern. The 2024 report indicated an increase in cryptocurrency use for CSAM trades. Bad actors allegedly use cryptocurrency “mixers” and “privacy coins” like Monero to launder funds while making it hard for law enforcement to track.

“The pseudonymity provided by cryptocurrency has allowed the payments for CSAM to “move quickly into the crypto world,” and we are committed to ensuring that Congress and the Administration have the full suite of tools needed to end CSAM and punish sellers of this Material.”

The letter comprised of six questions. Three questions were aimed at considering the findings of the said federal agencies regarding crypto and its connection to CSAM. The other questions sought new tools that would allow law enforcement to identify and crack down on buyers and sellers in this market.

The federal agencies have until May 10 to respond to the senators.

As per a report by security firm Slowmist on April 26, the scam is designed to deceive unsuspecting users. It involves convincing them to download the legitimate imToken wallet and sending them 1 USDT and small amounts of ETH as bait.

The victim is then instructed to change their ETH RPC URL to a node that has been maliciously modified and is under the control of the scammer.

A RPC allows applications to run code on a computer to communicate with a blockchain and is, as such, essential for the development of decentralized applications (dApps). In this instance, Ethereum RPC interacts with nodes, querying balances, sending transactions, or interacting with smart contracts.

After the user modifies the RPC URL, a falsified wallet balance is displayed on the victim’s end, leading them to believe that they have received a substantial amount of funds. When the user attempts to transfer the miner’s fees to cash out the USDT, they spot the deceit. By then, the scammer had removed all his traces and disappeared with the transferred fees.

“Users often focus only on whether funds have been credited to their wallets, overlooking potential risks. Scammers take advantage of this trust and negligence, using believable tactics such as transferring small amounts of money to deceive users,” researchers at Slowmist wrote.

Slowmist added that an investigation into one of the victim’s wallets revealed that it received 1 USDT and 0.002 ETH from the scammers’ address. Tracking that address showed that the scammer had sent 1 USDT to three other wallets.

The scammer’s address was associated with multiple trading platforms and was also flagged as “Pig Butchering Scammers” by the on-chain tracking tool MistTrack.

As such, Slowmist urged users to “remain vigilant during transactions,” adding that users should be “skeptical of others” to avoid being defrauded.

According to an official statement on Apr. 26, the U.K. government has updated proceeds of crime and terror legislation, facilitating more effective investigation, seizure, and recovery of illicit crypto by law enforcement agencies, marking a significant shift in the country’s approach to tackling illicit activities involving crypto.

The changes include allowing police to seize crypto without an arrest, enabling the seizure of items aiding investigations, and transferring illicit crypto into a controlled digital wallet inaccessible to criminals. Additionally, law enforcement officials can now seize “items that could be used to give information to help an investigation, such as written passwords or memory sticks.”

In an April 25 X thread, Ju said, “The US DOJ has arrested pioneers in Bitcoin privacy technology. Privacy stands as a core value of Bitcoin. Mixing itself is not a crime. Even crypto exchanges use mixing to safeguard user privacy.”

Furthermore, Ju highlighted that the way a feature is used and the intent behind deems it as lawful or illicit. He compared the Samourai wallet case the to usage of a knife, which can both be lawful and illegal. The CryptoQuant founder noted, “It’s like punishing the inventor of the knife instead of the one who uses it.

The DoJ has accused the Samourai Wallet founders, Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, of designing and operating a service that allegedly facilitated over $100 million in transactions tied to illicit activities.

Since its inception in 2015, the service is alleged to have handled about $2 billion in illicit transactions, generating around $4.5 million in fees.

Rodriguez was arrested and is scheduled for arraignment in Pennsylvania, while Hill was detained in Portugal and is awaiting extradition to the U.S. The crackdown extended to seizing the Samourai Wallet website hosted in Iceland and issuing a warrant to remove its mobile application from the Google Play Store.

Evidence from tweets and private messages indicates that the founders actively marketed their service to users looking to launder criminal proceeds. The application, which has amassed over 100,000 downloads, was reportedly targeted towards participants in the black and grey markets, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Edward Snowden, a noted whistleblower and advocate for digital privacy, also weighed in on the matter, criticizing the DoJ’s actions. On X, Snowden remarked, “The Department of ‘Justice’ has once again criminalized the developers of an app that restores financial privacy. The way to fix this is to make money private by default. Privacy must never be ‘exceptional,’ or they will make it criminal.”

What's the implied threat here?



Why does an average, law-abiding user seeking privacy need a PSA about something that literally no one properly understands (what is an MSB and what isn't) at this point.



There is zero reason for me to have considered Samourai Wallet an MSB. pic.twitter.com/763Ycy9Xw1 — Seth For Privacy | Activate LNHANCE (@sethforprivacy) April 25, 2024

Lyudmyla Kozlovska, a human rights advocate, also weighed in on the issue, outlining the capabilities of U.S. law enforcement to detect financial crimes involving cryptocurrencies.

“Since US law enforcement agencies have been able to identify a money laundering offense involving this particular wallet, then they are well equipped to detect such crimes,” Kozlovska stated.

Kozlovska also argued against the criminalization of mixing technologies and the developers behind them, adding, “This is exactly what we talk about in our meetings with regulators: we understand that US law enforcement has all the tools to track Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain.”

Meanwhile, The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently warned Americans against using unregistered cryptocurrency money-transmitting services, which might be aimed at smart-contract-driven privacy tools.

In an April 25 public service announcement, the FBI urged Americans only to use registered Cryptocurrency Money Services Businesses that comply with existing Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws.

In its announcement, the FBI wrote that it had recently conducted law enforcement operations against cryptocurrency services that were not licensed in “accordance with federal law,” adding that anyone using unlicensed services could “encounter financial disruptions” during law enforcement actions, particularly if the money is intermingled with illegally obtained funds."

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a lawsuit against Geosyn Mining, a Texas-registered Bitcoin mining firm, alongside its founders Caleb Joseph Ward and Jeremy George McNutt, alleging their involvement in an unregistered and fraudulent securities offering.

According to the lawsuit, between November 2021 and December 2022, the defendants raised more than $5.6 million from about 64 investors “through the sale of investment contracts.”

“[…] while soliciting investors, Defendants falsely claimed that Geosyn had favorable contracts with electricity providers which enabled Geosyn to operate the crypto asset mining machines profitably […].” The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

Additionally, the SEC claims that the defendants allegedly failed to disclose critical information to new investors, including the fact that they had never purchased or activated mining machines for some previous investors.

Furthermore, the financial regulator believes that Geosyn “failed to disclose” that it was not providing the services that it claimed in its offering documents, such as offering personalized crypto mining strategies or providing round-the-clock monitoring of mining machines.

The lawsuit further alleges that Ward and McNutt misappropriated approximately $1.2 million for personal use and made payments totaling about $354,500 to investors, purportedly as distributions from its mining activity. However, internal messages between the defendants purportedly indicate the need “to buy” Bitcoin to fully fund these distributions, the SEC added.

The SEC has accused Geosyn and its founders of violating federal securities laws concerning antifraud and registration provisions. The regulator seeks “permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties,” and any other equitable relief deemed necessary by the court."

The highly anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving is expected to have a less significant impact on the cryptocurrency’s trajectory over the next 12-18 months, according to analysts at Kaiko. Contrary to earlier expectations, the decrease in miners’ rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC may not serve as the primary catalyst for Bitcoin‘s growth, according to a recent research report from the Paris-based blockchain firm.

“It [Bitcoin] may have enjoyed massive returns following its previous halvings, but the latest event comes as the asset class matures and macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain.” Kaiko

This time, the analysts say Bitcoin’s future price depends on attracting new investors, especially through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. and soon in Hong Kong, showing the cryptocurrency’s growing acceptance in mainstream finance.

Given that this is the first time a halving has taken place in a high-interest rate environment, the analysts say “there is no precedent to how Bitcoin will trade in the long-run.” As per Kaiko, robust liquidity and increasing demand “will play a crucial role in improving Bitcoin’s value proposition in the coming months.”

As crypto.news detailed earlier, the traditional post-halving price surge pattern may see deviation this time due to various factors, including the condensed nature of the price cycle surrounding this halving event. Unlike past cycles, Bitcoin has already witnessed significant price increases, reaching new record highs before the halving, including a peak at $73,750 in mid-March."

During the final keynote session, titled The Future of Payments, Stripe’s president, John Collison, highlighted the company’s previous involvement with cryptocurrency, noting that their experience with crypto dates back a long time. Collison referenced the company’s earlier venture into Bitcoin (BTC) support in 2018, which was discontinued due to underutilization.

Collison expressed enthusiasm about the reintroduction, stating that Stripe is excited to bring back crypto to accept payments but only wanted Circle’s USDC stablecoin and a much better experience.

The decision to reintegrate crypto payments stems from its increasing utility, as emphasized in Collison’s presentation. Collison pointed out the improvements in transaction speeds and decreasing costs that make crypto a more viable medium of exchange.

This feature’s rollout is anticipated later this summer, marking Stripe’s reentry into the crypto sphere after a period of relative quiet. Collison had previously indicated the company’s interest in crypto’s potential despite some earlier products facing low demand.

Last May, Stripe introduced a fiat-to-crypto onramp, providing options for both customizable embeddable onramps for web3 companies and a Stripe-hosted option for user convenience.

Consensys filed a lawsuit against the U.S. SEC over what it describes as the agency’s illegal attempt to reframe its constitutional authority to include oversight on Ethereum (ETH), crypto’s second-largest decentralized network.

According to the blockchain developer, the SEC has wrongly labeled ETH as a security and adopted a “reckless approach” that will stifle innovation if left unchecked.

“We have time and time again witnessed the current SEC contradict itself with ever-changing views on the blockchain, consistently mischaracterizing this technology and what is built on it as a shallow and doomed investment scheme, rather than as the breakthrough technology it is.” Consensys announcement on SEC lawsuit

Consensys stated that this “aggressive SEC regulatory overreach” extends beyond U.S. capital markets and is counterproductive to the watchdog’s original remit.

Consensys fights back

The complaint from MetaMask’s creator comes as the SEC has increased its litigation efforts against the crypto industry and asked for an additional $158 million to muzzle the “wild west” digital asset ecosystem.

Furthermore, the lawsuit is a response to a Wells Notice issued against Consensys earlier this month, which suggested that MetaMask may be accused of operating as an unregistered broker-dealer entity.

The industry is also banding together to fight an investigation into the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to improvements within ETH’s ecosystem. As crypto.news reported last month, several companies and businesses received a voluntary inquiry from an unnamed state authority.

After being accused of federal violations, stakeholders like Coinbase and Kraken are battling the Wall Street securities regulator in court.

On April 24, United States District Judge Frederic Block pronounced Igbara guilty of orchestrating money laundering and wire fraud through his Instagram page and other social media profiles under the alias Jay Mazini.

“Igbara was a crypto con man. He not only created a fake online presence to purport that he was a wealthy crypto investor, but he also used his Instagram persona as proof of success when convincing his unsuspecting victims to invest in his schemes. He conned a New York Muslim community out of millions then simply spent it and gambled it away.” Thomas M. Fattorusso, IRS-CI Special Agent-in-Charge

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Igbara operated his Ponzi scheme via a sham venture dubbed Halal-Capital LLC. Using the company and his social media influence, the crypto fraudster collected capital from unsuspecting victims by offering attractive rates and falsified bank transfers as supposed payments for digital assets.

In addition to Igbara’s 84-month prison sentence, Judge Frederic Block ordered that he forfeit $10 million for his crimes.

Igbara’s conviction underscores a global effort to eradicate crypto fraud and bad actors from the digital asset ecosystem. FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years for defrauding customers of billions in cash and crypto.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to reject applications for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the price of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market value. According to a Reuters report, U.S. financial firms don’t expect spot Ethereum ETF approval to happen in May, citing discouraging meetings with the watchdog in recent weeks.

Thus far, VanEck, ARK Investment Management, and seven other issuers have submitted filings with the SEC to list spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC is required to make decisions on VanEck’s and ARK’s filings, which are the first in line, by May 23 and May 24 respectively, the report notes.

However, according to Reuters, the recent meetings between issuers and the SEC have been described as one-sided, with agency staff not engaging in substantive discussions about the proposed products. The people say the lack of engagement contrasts sharply with the extensive and detailed discussions that took place before the SEC gave the green light to spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in January.

The lack of engagement has led many to believe that the SEC is likely to reject the filings, as its staff didn’t articulate specific concerns or ask questions during the meetings, the sources say. It’s worth noting that the SEC’s rejection of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past was due to concerns about market manipulation. Nonetheless, the agency was still forced to approve them after Grayscale Investments won a court challenge, demonstrating that its proposed spot Bitcoin ETF closely resembled the previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs."

As a part of the policy change, the bank is establishing a groundwork for solicited purchases. This will be accompanied by risk tolerance requirements, alongside limits placed on allocation and trading frequency.

“We are going to make sure everybody has access to it. We just want to do it in a controlled way,” one source added, signaling the bank’s cautious approach.

Since the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in January, major brokerage players like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and Wells Fargo have all dipped their toes in this market. However, much like Morgan Stanley, they limited purchases to a non-advisory basis.

The recent move from Morgan Stanley is another testament to the growing demand for Bitcoin ETFs among institutional players. According to the second Morgan Stanley executive, this trend has also been seen among their clientele, but Bitcoin is still perceived as a speculative asset.

“For most of those people, it’s quite interesting, so they put in a little bit of money.”

Bitcoin ETFs have brought massive inflows to the cryptocurrency market over the past months. However, the movement seems to be slowing down, with ETF issuer BalckRock registering Zero Daily inflow for the first time on April 24.

Memecoins are more akin to a “risky casino” than to a useful product, as they badly affect the crypto market by making a series of “false promises,” according to a16z crypto’s CTO, Eddy Lazzarin, who shared his thoughts on the sector in X posts.

https://twitter.com/eddylazzarin/status/1783179299085856934

Lazzarin highlighted the transformative impact of memecoins on the public, saying memecoins “alter how the public, regulators, and entrepreneurs see crypto.”

“At best, it looks like a risky casino. Or a series of false promises masking a casino.” Eddy Lazzarin

Additionally, Lazzarin expressed concerns about the detrimental impact of memecoins on the industry, stating, “I see the damage every day.”

In a separate post, Lazzarin addressed the fluctuating interest in memecoins, expressing optimism about the development of real products and protocols in the crypto space. However, he cautioned against dismissing the negative consequences of memecoins, stating “we shouldn’t pretend that the casino doesn’t set us back.”

Lazzarin’s statements coincide with reports indicating increased hedge fund interest in memecoins as vehicles for quick profits. According to a Bloomberg report, California-based hedge fund Stratos introduced a fund that includes Dogifwhat, a memecoin featuring a dog mascot, which contributed to a 137% return for the fund in Q1. Additionally, sources reported that Brevan Howard, a New York-based alternative investment manager, has made a “tiny” investment in the memecoin market, although specific details weren’t disclosed."

The Bank of Russia alongside Rosfinmonitoring, the country’s main body for financial intelligence, is working on a platform to detect connections between fiat operations and crypto transactions amid efforts to evaluate the size of the local crypto market.

According to a report from RBC, Ilya Bushmelev, director of project portfolio management at “Innotech,” speaking at a forum organized by Rosfinmonitoring revealed that the platform is currently undergoing pilot testing by five lenders without naming them though.

“Based on the results of the pilot, a basic understanding of the necessary actions and tools for financial lenders in terms of conducting crypto-compliance should be formed.” Ilya Bushmelev

As per Bushmelev, the pilot, scheduled until the end of May, may be extended based on outcomes. The objective is to establish a foundational understanding of necessary actions and tools for financial institutions concerning crypto compliance, including the “know-your-crypto-client” and “know-your-crypto-transaction” procedures. As of press time, it’s unclear whether the pilot provided positive insights on the matter.

Specifically, 92,298 traders have witnessed liquidations worth $210.26 million in long and short positions.

With long positions comprising 84.7% of the liquidated trades, sentiment has swiftly transitioned from bullish to bearish, as the market flips red.

Moreover, the current market instability stems from Bitcoin’s retreat from its recent high of $67,183 on April 23. Following this peak, BTC experienced a notable correction, culminating in a 3.2% decline by the end of yesterday’s trading session.

This bearish momentum has persisted, leading Bitcoin to relinquish the psychologically significant $64,000 threshold earlier today. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization has declined by 3.87% over the past 24 hours, now standing at $2.47 trillion, as altcoins venture into bearish territory.

Being the premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has witnessed the largest liquidated positions among all crypto assets, totaling $44.6 million within 24 hours.

The liquidation trend was noticeable across the market on April 18 before the most recent Bitcoin halving, resulting in a loss of $247 million. The Bitcoin halving, taking place on April 20, sparked renewed optimism after this downturn, prompting a resurgence of long positions amid the market’s recovery.

Despite the recent increase in liquidations, the derivatives market has witnessed a surge in volume, with trade volume jumping by 30% in the last 24 hours to reach $159 billion at the reporting time. This is due to an increase in short positions, with the long/short ratio now sitting at 0.7832."

Approved on April 24, the new law aims to improve “due diligence measures and identity checks” for consumers. The framework encompasses all entities operating in the jurisdiction and extends to CASPs.

Affected entities, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, will be required to flag and report suspicious activities to the government. The framework falls under the broader Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation.

MiCA was developed by the European Commission last year and approved in June 2023 to govern cryptocurrency assets within the European Union. The goal is to protect investors and maintain financial stability.

The new law also requires the creation of a new entity called the Authority for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMLA). The supervising body, headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany, will oversee the implementation of the new regulations.

EU strategy and policy director at Circle, Patrick Hansen, provided more clarity on the matter on X. He mentioned that CASPSs will be required to adhere to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures.

If CASPs abide by the above regulations, crypto users in the nation would be able to use these platforms “for buying goods & services with crypto,” Hansen wrote. He added that this would only apply if the transaction value exceeds EUR 1000 (approx $1072).

This move could boost crypto-powered microtransactions in the EU, benefitting crypto payment companies like Strike, which recently expanded its services for European customers.

However, the circle executive clarified that this requirement was already in place via existing regulations. All wallet providers and cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the nation are required to comply with these regulations.

“Previous versions of the proposed AMLR, proposed a way stricter approach that would have meant a KYC on the self-custody originator/beneficiary, but also thanks to industry efforts a risk-based approach with various options was finally agreed on,” he added.

He noted that the law would be officially adopted by the Council of the EU and will be enforced three years later. According to Hansen, the final version of the law is a “positive result” for the cryptocurrency sector, which largely operates in a gray area."

Most other Bitcoin ETF participants experienced a dry spell as well. Out of the 11 Bitcoin ETFs registered in the U.S., only Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) saw inflows of $5.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively.

Meanwhile, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) continued to suffer losses. On April 24, GBTC reported $130.4 million in outflows, bringing the net outflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs to $120.6 million for the day.

Although IBIT has never experienced a dearth of inflows previously, something similar has transpired frequently among ETF participants. Fidelity’s FBTC, for example, has seen three days of $0 inflows in the last two weeks.

To date, the Bitcoin ETF market in the U.S. has collected a net of $12.3 billion in Bitcoin. However, GBTC outflows have countered some of the inflows recorded by the remaining ten Bitcoin ETFs. As of Jan. 11, outflows from GBTC have surpassed $17 billion.

Earlier, on April 24, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst, took to X to commend the 71-day streak of continuous inflows to the IBIT ETF.

The fund has surpassed the Global Jets ETF, as well as Vanguard’s bond market ETF and developed-markets ETF, which Balchunas referred to as “one-hit wonders” and “cash vacuum cleaners.”

The streak places BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF among the top ten funds of all time by yet another metric. However, Balchunas stated that there is “a lot of mountain still left to climb” to reach the top rank.

JPMorgan’s Equity Premium Income ETF had the longest inflow streak of any ETF, lasting 160 days. With $18.27 billion in assets, BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund ranks in the top 3% of all ETFs ever created.

The success of the ETF can be ascribed to institutions gradually increasing their exposure to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a significant part of these companies’ strategies. Instead, Balchunas described it as “hot sauce” on top of larger portfolios.

“Shows that most of the bites are nibbles but there are a lot of fish,” he said.

However, not all of BlackRock’s cryptocurrency efforts have met with immediate success. BlackRock’s tokenized fund, BUIDL, which debuted on the Ethereum blockchain on March 20, has attracted only a few investors thus far.

Despite the fact that BUIDL increased by 200% in just a few weeks, on-chain data shows that the majority of the fund’s assets are spread over 11 wallets."

The analysts emphasized that transaction fees in the Bitcoin network increased to record-highs relative to the total miner revenue right on halving day, suggesting that miners “seem to be running operations at the same rate as before the halving.” CryptoQuant noted that despite the network’s upgrade, the total network hashrate has “remained flat to slightly higher at a rate of 617 EH/s.”

“Although it is still too early to see any long-term effects of the halving on the network hashrate, miners seem to be running operations at the same rate as before the halving.” CryptoQuant

The analysts attributed the increase in fees to the launch of the RUNES protocol, a fungible token standard on the Bitcoin network, which allows the issuance and transfer of fungible tokens by storing data in OP RETURN codes.

Bitcoin’s fourth halving event, which occurred on Apr. 20, has sparked significant interest, particularly in its comparison to gold in terms of scarcity.

If approved, the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act proposed on April 17 seems positioned to introduce regulatory clarity for the $157 billion-strong stablecoin market currently dominated by Tether (USDT).

Stablecoins are fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies that offer stability in an otherwise volatile financial market. Such assets are typically tied to sovereign currencies like the U.S. dollar, such as Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), serving as gateways to on-and-off ramp liquidity.

The bill would permit U.S. banks to issue fiat-pegged tokens with no threshold, but require service providers without a banking license to maintain a market cap under $10 billion.

According to Andrew O’Neil, Managing Director and Co-Chair of S&P Global’s Digital Assets Research Labs, the regulatory framework will give banks an edge over other market participants and incentivize blockchain adoption in the financial sector through asset tokenization and digital bond issuance.

O’Neil said on-chain payment rails offer real-time and efficient settlement, citing BlackRock Ethereum-based fund as an example.

“Investment group Blackrock’s BUIDL fund provides a recent use case. The tokenized fund, which uses the Ethereum blockchain and invests in U.S. treasuries, has a liquidity pool denominated in the USDC stablecoin, for which investors can redeem share tokens via a smart contract, instantaneously and 24/7.” Andrew O’Neil, Managing Director and Co-Chair of S&P Global’s Digital Assets Research Labs

Although the Lummis-Gillibrand bill will not impact existing U.S.-based products like PayPal USD, the framework does not authorize offshore entities like Tether. The terms could shake USDT’s presence in the market, but O’Neil noted that Tether’s activities and volume are predominantly out of the United States.

Additionally, decentralized stablecoins are not included in the regulations, so offerings like Maker’s DAI and Frax Finance’s FRAX fall out of the proposal’s purview. Policymakers likely prefer centralized systems like USDC as they mirror existing financial operations, O’Neil explained.

Finally, the S&P report predicted an influx of new providers in the digital asset custody industry, especially with an update to SEC rules which no longer require custodians to report crypto-assets on their balance sheet. crypto.news reached out to O’Neil and the S&P for further comment on the bill and its impacts."

Starting on April 16, transactions with USDT have and will continue to receive a special discount of 0.02 TON instead of 0.032 TON for the first transaction and 0.0145 TON for subsequent transactions.

In the next node update, the developers plan to introduce the ability to pre-compile smart contracts.

“This means that the most popular smart contracts, written in C++, will be embedded directly in the node, bypassing the need for TVM execution. This adjustment reduces resource consumption and, consequently, the fees associated with these contracts.” TON announcement

Following the announcement, the price of TON fell by 2.4% to $5.55 at the time of writing. Toncoin has continued to decline in price shortly after updating its all-time high of $7.65 on April 11.

Over the past week, the coin has lost nearly 10% of its value despite recent announcements by Telegram founder Pavel Durov at the Token2049 conference in Dubai. Reports of support for the USDT stablecoin on the TON blockchain have also been announced.

On April 16, rumors appeared that the TON team was planning to reduce user transaction costs. This year, TON is also expected to introduce gas-free transactions, update the Wallet 5.0, and develop new Teleport cross-chain technology."

On April 24, Strike CEO Jack Mallers shared plans to power Bitcoin (BTC) adoption in Europe by allowing users to buy, sell, and send the leading crypto token across the continent.

An official announcement said eligible European customers could buy BTC via bank accounts using uncapped Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) deposits. As of this writing, SEPA’s area consists of 36 countries, including all European Union member states, four countries in the European Free Trade Association, and the United Kingdom.

Mallers also explained that Strike users can withdraw Bitcoin into self-custody or via the Lightning network to any supported wallet.

Furthermore, the BTC-focused app will enable P2P transfers, allowing customers to engage in cross-border payments denominated in Bitcoin, euros within Europe, U.S. dollars in America, or Tether’s USDT in supported regions.

“Today marks another milestone in our global journey, but our work is far from over. We will continue to enter new markets, support more currencies, add payment methods, expand our services, and iterate on the experience.” Jack Mallers, Strike CEO

Strike’s Bitcoin expansion spree

Strike’s foray into European markets coincides with heightened interest in BTC and crypto-related services from the region’s populace. As crypto.news reported earlier this month, the continent is a leader for Google searches regarding BTC technological upgrades and dominates the crypto-banking sector with over 60 banks offering digital asset services.

However, Europe is only the latest destination for Strike. Last year, the firm moved its global headquarters to El Salvador, where it was looking to tap the Latin American market. The BTC platform also has a presence in the U.S. and across Africa, servicing more than 100 countries worldwide.

Mallers, a vocal BTC maxi, has said that the cryptocurrency will hit $1 million due to its fundamental design and global hyperinflation. The founder backed up his belief by going all in BTC, supposedly holding zero USD."

As reported, the halving event on Saturday reduced block subsidies, with the issuance dropping from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This translates to an issuance of approximately 450 bitcoin per day, further underlining the event’s impact on Bitcoin’s supply dynamics.

Yassine Elmandjra from ARK Investment Management echoed similar sentiments, noting that Bitcoin’s issuance rate post-halving is now lower than gold’s long-term supply growth.

Elmandjra’s analysis, as shared in the ARK Disrupt newsletter, emphasized the significant decrease in Bitcoin’s supply growth following the halving event, reinforcing its comparison with gold.

This agreement, unveiled on April 23, aims to improve the identification of assets that may be taxed in either country. It also aims to promote a more effective interchange of cryptocurrency-related data and information across tax authorities. Additionally, it discusses compliance with tax obligations.

According to Mekar Satria Utama, a director of the Indonesian Directorate General of Taxes (DGT), the MoU emphasizes the importance of innovation and collaboration among tax authorities. The strategy is critical for keeping up with the rapid advances in the worldwide landscape of financial technologies, he stressed.

“While crypto assets are relatively new, the need to ensure equitable taxation remains essential to promote economic growth and provide revenue for crucial public investments in areas like infrastructure, education and healthcare,” Utama said in a statement.

Australian tax authorities and their Indonesian counterparts have worked together in the past. This collaboration has encompassed several DGT priorities. It contains features such as the digitization of taxpayer services through the implementation of a virtual tax assistant.

Furthermore, the two organizations collaborated on the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) for digital goods and services.

Indonesia has been engaged in developing laws for the crypto sector. It has also encouraged partnership with foreign countries and international groups to develop a solid crypto framework.

Leading these activities is Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK), which has been working with financial regulators in Malaysia, Singapore, and Dubai to create the basis for crypto regulation.

According to a recent ruling, crypto companies wishing to operate in Indonesia must first go through a regulatory sandbox before obtaining a license, which will take effect in January 2025. This regulation change coincides with the Financial Services Authority’s (OJK) move to oversee the cryptocurrency sector.

Entities that provide cryptocurrency services in Indonesia without first completing a sandbox evaluation would be deemed illegal.

Meanwhile, Australia is one of many countries working with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to create the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), which allows for the automatic exchange of information about crypto-assets. The aim is to institute a standardized approach for the worldwide taxation of cryptocurrencies. While not explicitly a bilateral tax treaty, the objective of this collaboration is to streamline tax procedures and reduce instances of tax evasion concerning crypto earnings."

The Eurosystem wouldn’t be able to identify people based on their payments with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), as it would see “only a minimal set of data necessary to fulfill Eurosystem tasks, such as settlement,” Deutsche Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel said during his speech at the DZ Bank Capital Markets Conference 2024.

Addressing privacy concerns, Nagel noted that financial institutions and other payment service providers processing digital euro payments “would not be allowed to use personal and transaction-related data for commercial purposes.” He noted though that this restriction would only be lifted if users explicitly granted consent.

“They [banks] would, however, have limited access to these data to the extent necessary in order for them to comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations. Offline payments would therefore be limited to low-value transactions.” Joachim Nagel

In addition to privacy concerns, Nagel also acknowledged that banks “have their share of concerns when it comes to the digital euro,” saying the lenders are afraid that the digital euro “might become an attractive substitute to bank deposits.”

“Banks could lose an important source of funding. This could cause structural disintermediation and reduce banks’ ability to provide credit.” Joachim Nagel

He assured that the Eurosystem is aware of these risks and will implement necessary precautions, including setting low maximum amounts for CBDC holdings to ensure that “banks will be able to cope with an additional demand for liquidity.”

Although Nagel admitted that some people “doubt whether we need a digital euro at all,” he emphasized his confidence in the economy digitization, saying that both consumers and retailers “would appreciate the benefits of having a single payment instrument that ticks all the boxes.”

Meanwhile, the United States is taking a cautious approach regarding the launch of a CBDC, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicating that the country is far from making a recommendation or implementing a CBDC. During his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in early March, Powell assured the public that there is no immediate need to be concerned about a central bank digital currency, emphasizing that such developments are not on the horizon in the near future."

He went on to criticize the HBAR Foundation for framing the announcement in a misleading way, likening it to an individual buying a luxury item and claiming a partnership with the brand:

“What did happen was a HBAR project through the secondary market tokenized shares of a BlackRock fund. Much like I can buy a Rolex take a pic and post it on my X account. Doesn’t mean Rolex ‘partnered’ with me.”

Crypto.news reached out to Chris O’Connor regarding the matter but did not hear back at the time of writing.

At the time of writing, the Hedera token was trading at $0.1415, still up 60% in the last 24 hours. HBAR also had a trading volume of $2.76 billion in the same period.

PEPE is up by 18.5% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $0.0000080 at the time of writing. The meme coin’s market cap increased to $3.31 billion, making it the 37th-largest digital asset at the reporting time.

Moreover, the PEPE daily trading volume rallied by 62%, reaching $1.64 billion. Data shows that 46.8% of the meme coin’s trading activity, over $768 million, comes from the Binance crypto exchange.

On April 11, Coinbase announced to list the Pepe perpetual futures contract on its platform, but had to delay the operation due to “technical reasons” on April 18. After a five-day pause on April 23, the exchange announced the 1000PEPE-PERP contract was available for non-U.S. residents.

According to data provided by Santiment, the number of whale transactions consisting of at least $100,000 worth of PEPE increased by 11% over the past day — rising from 246 to 273 unique transactions.

The meme coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also increased from 46 to 56 in the past 24 hours, per Santiment. This movement shows that PEPE is slightly overheated and overvalued at this price point and a moderately higher price volatility would be expected.

An RSI of lower than 50 could potentially mean that PEPE might be in good condition for a further price rally.

Data from the market intelligence platform shows that Pepe’s exchange activity has also increased. Per Santiment, 5.65 trillion PEPE tokens entered the exchanges in the past 24 hours while 4.87 trillion coins flowed out of the exchange in the same timeframe.

The 780 billion PEPE net inflow into the exchanges shows that some investors might be looking for short-term profits until further market movements."

Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao might be facing 36 months in prison after pleading guilty to violating laws against money laundering, as U.S. prosecutors said in a recent court filing that such a sentence would provide “adequate deterrence to Zhao and to others who may also be tempted to put profits above compliance with U.S. laws.”

“Zhao committed serious crimes in a deliberate scheme to grow Binance as quickly as possible and then to maintain its dominance as the largest cryptocurrency exchange. His crimes warrant meaningful prison time.” U.S. prosecutors

According to security experts, Telegram’s support for The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the Toncoin (TON) token has led to scammers targeting unsuspecting token holders.

Since November 2023, scams against Toncoin holders have increased as interest and TON investments have ramped up. The attackers promote a complex referral scheme to steal TON tokens from users.

Potential victims are invited to join a Telegram bot supposedly designed to store cryptocurrency and link a web3 wallet to the bot’s system. Victims are then forced to buy “boosters” using a bot. Scammers claim that users must complete this action to start earning money. However, purchasing a booster makes the user irrevocably lose control over his cryptocurrency.

The scammers promise earnings from two sources: a flat payment of 25 TON for each friend the user refers to and a commission based on the booster rate purchased by referrals. Kaspersky estimates that users lose between $2 and $2,700 to scams.

Meanwhile, Toncoin’s price has fallen by more than 5% over the past 24 hours to $5.72, according to CoinMarketCap data. By month, TON’s prices have risen 10%, largely thanks to several initiatives involving the Telegram messenger.

According to Udi Wertheimer on X, an advocate for OP_CAT, the proposal aims to enable covenants on Bitcoin, opening avenues for smart contracts, secure bridges, on-chain trading, zk proof verification, and more. However, it’s worth noting that the proposal hasn’t yet gained official status as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP).

Covenants on Bitcoin (BTC), in essence, are sophisticated scripting features dictating specific conditions on how bitcoins can be spent in future transactions.

Covenants have the potential for various use cases, from creating secure vaults that facilitate reversible transactions to enabling automated recurring payments, time-locked transfers for inheritance purposes, and even complex financial instruments like escrows and bonds.

Originally, OP_CAT was part of Bitcoin’s early opcodes but was disabled by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010 due to concerns about potential vulnerabilities. An opcode, a command within the Bitcoin scripting language, is crucial in executing operations within Bitcoin scripts.

The proposal, spearheaded by Ethan Heilman and Armin Sabouri, proposes reintroducing OP_CAT through a backward-compatible soft fork, specifically by redefining the opcode OP_SUCCESS126, which aims to mitigate confusion by retaining the original opcode value.

The proponents argue that reintroducing OP_CAT would enhance Bitcoin’s capabilities, simplify decentralized protocols, support advanced multi-sig setups, and expand Bitcoin’s scripting power and flexibility.

However, realizing an OP_CAT soft fork hinges on technical feasibility, security considerations, and achieving consensus within the community.

Besides OP_CAT, several other covenant proposals are under consideration within the Bitcoin ecosystem, each with its unique approach and potential trade-offs. These include Check Template Verify (CTV), OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK (CSFS), and LNHANCE, each offering different functionalities and levels of formalization in their proposals."

El Salvador Chivo debacle

Chivo is the official Bitcoin storage solution provided by the government of El Salvador. The wallet became a national tool after President Nayib Bukele officially adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021, becoming the first country to do so worldwide.

Salvadorans can use Chivo to buy or sell Bitcoin. Chivo also allows citizens to withdraw cryptocurrency from BTC ATMs across El Salvador. Shortly after its launch, users reported issues with the wallet, such as slow execution, app crashes, and other bugs.

The government partnered with U.S. white-label software firm AlphaPoint to address technical glitches, as crypto.news reported in 2022.

Matters escalated earlier this month after the personal info of some five million Salvadorans was exposed online. Per DataBreaches, the 144GB leak was extracted from a former national security advisor named Alejandro Muyshondt. The hackers reportedly accessed the files from a cloud backup.

Initially, the source was unclear and mistaken for a vaccination database since it features details like full names, dates of birth, individual profile photos, and addresses.

https://crypto.news/lava-network-founder-discusses-rpc-protocols-and-current-challenges/,Lava network founder discusses RPC protocols and current challenges,2024-04-23 11:46:56+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","In an exclusive sitting with crypto.news, Yair Cleper, CEO and founder of Lava network, discussed the intricacies of the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocols and their role in the evolution of blockchain tech.

RPCs are protocols that allow applications to communicate with a blockchain and are, as such, essential for the development of decentralized applications (dApps). Recent challenges with RPC reliability have been a major topic of discussion in the crypto industry.

Lately, RPC disruptions have affected the functioning of major networks like Solana and Manta, resulting in industry-wide calls for better RPC infrastructure.

Cleper’s Lava network has created a platform that connects dapps to the best RPC providers in an effort to address the challenges faced by blockchain networks, uniquely positioning him to offer insights on the subject.

What are some of the key factors contributing to RPC unreliability in various blockchain ecosystems?

The reasons for RPC unreliability depend on which ecosystem you are looking at. On Ethereum, it’s down to centralization, where a couple of major providers support most of the traffic, and if they become unavailable, dapp users cannot connect with Ethereum. However, on most other chains, especially newly launched chains, unreliability is due to the fact that RPC support primarily comes from community members who voluntarily spin up nodes.

Is there a way to address these?

Some basic measures to improve reliability would be to make it easy and obvious for users to switch to another provider if one becomes unavailable. Another option is to promote a diversity of providers so the ecosystem does not become overly reliant on a small handful.

And from your perspective, what are the broader consequences of RPC downtime for dApp developers and their users across the blockchain ecosystem?

If RPC goes down, for a user, this is the same as the blockchain itself going down. We’ve already seen many past outages or congestion issues which have resulted in users not being able to connect to chains. This was particularly obvious on Ethereum during DeFi and NFT summer, where one huge NFT mint would be enough to bring down multiple RPC providers.

Can developers mitigate such risks?

Developers can mitigate these risks by using a decentralized and highly redundant service like Lava, which aggregates multiple RPC providers into one network and has automatic fall-backs in case of provider downtime. Some developers are already using solutions like load-balancers, which can also help.

Recent high-profile RPC outages have highlighted vulnerabilities in the current dapp infrastructure. How does Lava plan to mitigate such risks, ensuring reliability and continuity for users and developers?

Lava is building a network for chains and rollups to easily bootstrap their RPC and API infrastructure through a mechanism called Incentivized Public RPC. We are building Lava with many considerations in mind. The network must be agnostic to support any chain and API. It must be permissionless and can quickly support any in-demand chain and API. It must offer low latency and geolocation-based routing, with requests sent to servers closest to the user. It must be super reliable and highly available. Finally, it should be decentralized, with no single point of control that can prevent someone from accessing the blockchain. This would defeat the point of web3.

Are any chains already implementing this?

Lava already actively works with different chains, including NEAR, Evmos, and Axelar, to bootstrap, optimize and decentralize their infrastructure.

How did you envision the evolution of decentralized data access layers in terms of technology and adoption?

Lava was designed to be highly flexible as a data access layer, and RPC is only the start of the many potential use cases for the network. As blockchains increase in adoption, Lava will support more complex and specialized APIs which can retrieve indexed data specific to a dapp or set of smart contracts. Additionally, today, data access layers are primarily designed for chains to onboard more dapps. However, in the future, dapps will become app-specific rollups; they will become blockchains themselves. This means Lava’s ability to permissionlessly and dynamically support new chains, faster than centralized providers, will become increasingly important.

So will RPC providers play a key role in the evolution of blockchain tech?

Whether you’re a dapp or you’re a rollup developer, RPC is the fundamental infrastructure you need, and only Lava has solutions for both."

A legal pad bearing the phrase “Buy Bitcoin” is attracting bids nearing $140,000 in an online auction, gaining attention after being displayed behind former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen during Congressional testimony nearly seven years ago.

Made by Christian Langalis, then a 22-year-old intern at the Cato Institute and a Bitcoin enthusiast, the written message sparked both controversy and admiration.

Despite Langalis being escorted out of the hearing for his act, his artifact is now attracting bids nearing $140,000 (2.2 BTC as of press time) in an online auction described as an “Ink Drawing on Legal Pad” on Scarce City, a marketplace that uses BTC to sell crypto-related goods for the crypto. At the time of writing, the largest bid (2.2 BTC) has been placed by an X user under alias @BITPAINTCLUB.

“Bitcoin was massively rupturing into the halls of institutional finance in 2017. Any Bitcoiner worth their sats would have told you so. It’s good to finally liberate this number from my sock drawer and offer it back to the Bitcoin public. The message was subversive then, but now merely obvious: Bitcoin is flowing. Control is dead.” Christian Langalis

Set to conclude on Apr. 24, the winner of the auction will be announced at a Bitcoin-themed eatery in New York, where Langalis is employed. According to the lot’s description, the sign is “one of few widely-recognized physical Bitcoin artifacts, given Bitcoin’s virtual nature.”"

Binance‘s dominance in Bitcoin trading outside the U.S. market appears to be shrinking, as its share dropped from 81.3% to 55.3% over the past year as the exchange faced increased competition following the removal of its large-scale Bitcoin zero-fee promotion. According to data from Kaiko, the same trend can also be observed with smaller altcoins, where Binance’s share declined from 58% to 50.5%.

Analysts at the Paris-headquartered firm attributed the shifts to the growing competition in the market, as smaller exchanges are gaining traction as trading volumes recover. For example, platforms like Bybit and OKX are expanding their presence, especially in regions like Asia, with Bybit’s share of non-U.S. Bitcoin trading surging from 2% to 9.3%, while OKX’s gaining from 3% to 7.3%. Bullish, MEXC, and Bithumb also saw significant increases, the analysts added.

In the meantime, Binance is facing challenges, as its $4.3 billion deal with U.S. regulators imposed certain restrictions on the exchange. Binance COO Noah Perlman earlier noted that the monitoring agreement with U.S. regulators is now posing challenges for the exchange despite viewing the deal as an opportunity for improvement. Perlman says the U.S. now acts as an “authorized referee,” and even though the exchange is “not thrilled to have it,” Binance still considers it “as an opportunity to continue to enhance the programs, procedures we have.”"

Anticipation surrounding Riot‘s financial performance, particularly in the wake of recent analyst predictions, has fueled significant investor interest. The bullish sentiment was evident as Riot Platform’s stock (RIOT) on Nasdaq surged by 23% to $11.24 as of April 23, according to data from Google Finance.

On April 22, Analyst Mike Colonnese from H.C. Wainwright reaffirmed a Buy rating on Riot Platforms and set a target price of $20.00. He noted the company’s clear growth trajectory and strong financial position as key factors for his positive outlook.

Colonnese highlighted Riot’s plans to significantly enhance its hash rate from 12.4 EH/s to 31.5 EH/s by the end of 2024 and to 41 EH/s by the end of 2025. This strategic increase in capacity is supported by the operational commencement of the first 400 MW substation at the new Corsicana facility in Texas.

Furthermore, the firm’s financial robustness is underscored by its liquidity of over $1.2 billion, positioning it well for future expansions.

Riot’s current low-cost production strategy and the underperformance of its stock year-to-date were identified by Colonnese as an attractive opportunity for investment. He also mentioned the reduced shipment times for necessary mining rigs due to the manufacturing presence of MicroBT in Pennsylvania, which aids Riot’s near-term expansion strategies.

While Colonnese acknowledges some past challenges in deployment timelines, he remains confident in Riot’s capacity for the effective execution of its expansion plans.

Separately, on the same day, Roth MKM analyst Darren Aftahi expressed a similarly bullish stance on Riot Platforms following his attendance at the company’s Analyst Day in New York.

Aftahi maintained a Buy rating with a price target of $25.50, expecting the company to achieve an EBITDA of $54.7 million on revenue of $391.5 million in fiscal 2024, with further improvements to $144.5 million EBITDA on $516.4 million revenue in fiscal 2025.

The analyst’s optimism is rooted in Riot’s strong financial structure, highlighted by approximately $1.3 billion in cash and Bitcoin holdings as of the end of March.

“Following the halving, we believe RIOT is one of a few miners that has a line of sight to a significantly higher hash rate in the next 6-12 months,” he wrote.

Furthermore, as per the analyst, the partial energization of Corsicana’s first building is a key factor that could drive major growth in Riot’s hash rate and, consequently, its stock valuation in the near term."
https://crypto.news/philippines-sec-to-ban-binance-app-from-google-and-apple-store/,Philippines SEC to ban Binance app from Google and Apple store,2024-04-23 10:15:16+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking to remove the Binance app from Google Play store and Apple’s app stores nationwide.

On April 9, the commission sent separate letters to Google and Apple requesting the removal of the applications that allow users to access Binance’s trading platform. The recent move came after the Philippine National Telecommunications Commission blocked access to the prominent cryptocurrency exchanges’ website in March 2024.

“The SEC has identified [Binance] and concluded that the public’s continued access to these websites/apps poses a threat to the security of the funds of investing Filipinos,” SEC Chairperson Emilio B. Aquino wrote in the letter.

According to Aquino, Binance has been found guilty of offering unregistered securities to Philippine residents. The regulators have labeled Binance as an unregistered broker, currently in violation of the Securities Regulation Code.

Data from GWI research claims that the Philippines hosts more than 9.3 million cryptocurrency holders and is the seventh-largest nation in terms of cryptocurrency ownership. Considering the popularity of Binance across the globe, Binance likely handles a significant chunk of this market share.

According to Aquino, banning the Binance app will “prevent the further proliferation of its illegal activities in the country” and will help protect the public from its “detrimental effects” on the nation’s economy.

The SEC initially cracked down on the premiere cryptocurrency exchange in November 2023, citing a lack of a license to operate in the nation. Investors using Binance were given a three-month window to liquidate their positions on the platform.

As part of this effort, the commission also contacted Google and Meta, requesting a pause of advertisements from Binance targeting Philippine residents.

The recent move closely mirrors that of the Indian government, which blocked access to Binance using a similar strategy. First, the regulators urged tech giants Apple and Google to remove the Binance app and then completely revoked access to the platform by placing a geoblock on the exchange’s trading platform.

As previously reported by crypto.news, Binance is expected to return to India as a fully compliant platform after paying a hefty fine. It is yet to be seen if the firm will take up a similar route in the case of the Philippines."

Data from Etherscan reveals that the attack occurred on April 23 in nearly one hour, lasting from 05:39 to 06:29 UTC.

Transaction data confirms that the perpetrators executed a multi-call phishing attack, essentially combining multiple function calls into a single transaction. While these calls might look benign when viewed separately, together, they tell the tale of a malicious action.

Moreover, the multiple calls triggered outflows from the victim’s address to several wallets belonging to the hackers, with some of these addresses already identified as phishing wallets by Etherscan. In all, the victim lost over 1.6 billion ANDY tokens, worth $162,400, and 17,913 USDC.

This attack emptied the victim’s account, with its balance currently sitting at $32 worth of Ethereum (ETH) and Arbitrum (ARB). While one of the attacker’s addresses has held onto the loot, the second, which received all the ANDY tokens, immediately swapped them for WETH on Uniswap and then moved the WETH to a new address.

The attack likely exploited the victim’s interactions with smart contracts. Often, these malicious actors create contracts that look like they are performing a standard defi operation — such as swapping tokens — but embedded in the transactions are calls that, for instance, approve the transfer of the user’s tokens to the attacker.

Crypto.news spotted a similar attack last month, which led to the loss of $674,000 in USDC. The perpetrators immediately funneled the assets to the Ox protocol for liquidation. Amid the growing prevalence of these schemes, a report revealed that over 57,000 crypto users lost $46 million to phishing attacks in February."

The downtrend comes as the average transaction fee on the network plunges.

According to data provided by YCharts, the average transaction fee on the Bitcoin network declined by 28% in the past 24 hours, hovering around $24.99 at the time of writing.

Data shows that the average Bitcoin transaction fee surged from $19.76 to $128.45 between April 19 and 20. It’s important to note the transaction fee was sitting at $5 a month ago and dropped to as low as $2.8 on April 6.

Moreover, the daily Bitcoin miners’ revenue has also been declining after the network’s block reward was cut in half. Per data from YCharts, the miners’ earnings fell by 5.1% on April 22, reaching $48.17 million per day.

PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group, in partnership with Energy Web and DMG Blockchain Solutions, has proposed utilizing “cryptoeconomic incentives” to encourage Bitcoin miners to use low-carbon energy sources, according to a blog post from April 22.

The company expects that the experimental incentive will spark greater discussion and innovation around Bitcoin, and it is soliciting industry feedback on potential improvements.

Bitcoin mining is the process by which individuals known as “miners” solve cryptographic puzzles to generate new blocks of transactions on a cryptocurrency’s blockchain, with the fastest miners earning bitcoins for their efforts. Miners utilize big, energy-hungry computers to break through such puzzles fast.

According to the plan, “green miners” who use sustainable energy sources would be granted unique “green keys,” which are linked to their public keys.

Bitcoin transactions would be preferentially directed to environmentally friendly miners by attaching lower fees, along with an additional BTC reward locked in a multisig payout address that only these green miners can access.

“Green miners will be incentivized to mine these transactions since they will be the only ones eligible for the additional “locked” BTC reward,” the proposal explained.

This incentivizes sensible, profit-driven miners to use low-carbon energy sources in order to earn more Bitcoin. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, utilizing low-carbon mining technologies reduces carbon emissions and slows global warming.

According to the paper, the proposed solution will use Energy Web’s “Green Proofs for Bitcoin” platform to help miners obtain certification based on their clean energy and grid impact scores. Green miners can participate in the incentive scheme by registering and sharing their green keys on the platform.

“The solution outlined here aims to achieve a good degree of decentralization, ease of implementation and trust independence while distributing incentives,” the company said.

According to critics, the solution is being developed at a time when Bitcoin creation places an enormous burden on local power systems and taxpayers in the US.

Critics have attempted to prohibit Bitcoin mining, claiming that it causes air, water, and noise pollution, among other environmental hazards. According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, the process requires an estimated 127 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy every year, which is more than Argentina’s total energy consumption.

Meanwhile, a New York Times article revealed that Bitcoin miners utilize about seven times the energy Google uses for its global operations each year."

According to Business Insider, “Bitcoin’s price could still more than double this year,” said Kendrick.

Speaking on BNN Bloomberg, Kendrick pointed out that Bitcoin (BTC) has recently faced a downturn, sliding 11% from its peak at about $73,000 in March.

He noted that “this pullback stems primarily from slowing inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and rising tensions in the Middle East,” which have temporarily overshadowed the market.

Despite these challenges, Kendrick remains confident about the market’s capacity to recover by reiterating Standard Chartered’s statement from last month with a price prediction of $150,000 by year’s end.

“From where we are now, it’s starting to look like we can push higher again,” Kendrick said, citing the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s past performance, especially after halving events. Previous halving events have historically triggered price surges by reducing the new Bitcoin supply.

Days after the Bitcoin (BTC) halving, on-chain analytics provider Mempool.space reported BTC gas fees of around $9.51 for low-priority transactions and $10.07 for medium-priority actions on crypto’s largest decentralized network.

High-priority transactions cost as much as $10.44 per data seen at press time. The figures represented a massive drop compared to fees after last week’s halving. At the time, participants had to pay more than $146 for medium-priority transactions and over $170 for high-priority sends.

According to CoinMarketCap, the price of BTC was relatively unchanged after the asset’s much-anticipated code change designed by Satoshi Nakamoto to bolster scarcity and kneecap token inflation. In the past seven days, BTC gained around 2.4% to trade at around $66,000.

Bitcoin Runes meet lackluster post-halving results

A primary concern during the BTC pre-halving was reduced revenue for miners due to block rewards being cut by 50%. Casey Rodarmor’s Runes protocol was touted as a solution and was slated to launch simultaneously with the halving to bootstrap on-chain activity.

Rodarmor’s Runes enables users to create UTXO-based fungible assets on BTC’s blockchain, promising another avenue to kickstart decentralized finance (defi) on the world’s biggest blockchain.

Bitcoin Runes is said to improve on the BRC-2O token standard designed by the pseudonymous developer Domo. Domo’s idea was an offshoot of the Ordinal protocol released by Rodarmor.

Days after the halving, the Runestone NFT collection has nearly 50% of its floor price value. Per MagicEden, the average cost of a so-called Runestole fell from 0.073 BTC to 0.035 as of writing, signaling reduced interest in the concept after the initial hype."

The new offering, RWA (Real-World Assets) Earn Vaults, was developed in collaboration with the London-based OpenTrade. It is designed to combine the stability of traditional financial instruments with the innovative features of the cryptocurrency market.

“For the first time, retail users on a centralized exchange can instantly access an interest-bearing account backed by U.S. Treasury Bills,” said Willy Chuang, Woo X’s Chief Operating Officer, in an email.

The move comes as the tokenization of high-quality assets like U.S. Treasuries gains popularity, driven by recent hikes in interest rates and a concurrent crypto bull run.

It’s time to get real.

Global ETP trading volumes declined to $18 billion from $21 billion last week, although total BTC trading activity continued on the uptick. A month ago, ETFs constituted about 55% of all Bitcoin trading, but this number dwindled to around 28% because of macroeconomic factors.

While U.S. ETFs lost $244 million and BTC saw outflows of over $192 million, partly due to Grayscale GBTC liquidations, bearish investors did not anticipate lower market prices by deploying substantial capital to short positions and products. Investment vehicles offering short-Bitcoin funds noted around $300,000 in outflows.

OP Labs, which contributes to the Optimism ecosystem, provides the OP Stack to help developers create custom Layer 2 blockchains.

Celo’s migration to the Optimism ecosystem is intended to integrate it into the Superchain network, including chains like OP Mainnet and Base, enhancing scalability and performance.

Adopting optimistic rollups within this ecosystem aims to facilitate more efficient processing of Ethereum transactions, addressing scalability concerns by compiling transactions on a secondary layer.

According to a study received by crypto.news, in 2024, an average of 500,000 crypto traders are active in the Middle East, 166% more than last year. The number of traders is anticipated to reach 700,000 by the end of the year.

The growth is attributed to favorable local cryptocurrency regulations, approval of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs, and the growing appeal of digital assets amid a market rally. The UAE leads the region in implementing cryptocurrencies, as 72% of local users invest in Bitcoin.

“Users in the UAE have also expressed the highest willingness to invest in BTC and ETH, BTC being referred to as “digital gold” by UAE users.” Bitget Research

Additionally, Middle Eastern countries rely heavily on centralized global exchanges. Local exchange platforms such as Rain and M2 are not in the top 10 in terms of absolute traffic due to the lower variety and liquidity of tradable assets on local exchanges compared to global exchanges and the convenience of deposit and withdrawal channels in local currencies.

Notably, the Middle East caused a sharp collapse in the cryptocurrency market in mid-April. Against the backdrop of the worsening situation in the Middle East, all cryptocurrencies sharply sank in price between April 13 and April 14.

Kennedy Jr. has proposed to put the nation’s 2024 budget on a public blockchain.

During his April 21 rally in Michigan, Kennedy said that putting the U.S. budget on the blockchain would allow Americans to access any budget item at any time.

According to Kennedy, integrating the budget with blockchain technology will significantly increase transparency. He exemplified this by stating, “If somebody is spending $16,000 for a toilet seat, everybody’s going to know about it.”

If the proposal comes to fruition, American taxpayers will be able to track where funds are being spent. The idea was well-received by some corners of the cryptocurrency community, with some claiming it would end corruption.

“Putting the entire US budget on blockchain would be transformative. I don’t believe in silver bullets, but this is as close as one gets to one,” wrote one X user.

Another user pointed out that “public accounting might be the best use case for blockchain tech,” in addition to supply-chain implementations.

However, some critics of the notion claim that Kennedy is using this proposal to promote his central bank digital currency (CBDC) agenda. According to X user Jeremiah Harding, it isn’t possible for a government to track all budget transactions without implementing a “different unit of currency” like a CBDC.

Interestingly, Kennedy, who is a prominent advocate for decentralization, has previously expressed concerns regarding the launch of a CBDC in the U.S. Back in Jan. 2024, he described a CBDC as “a calamity for human rights and for civil rights.”

Kennedy is also one of the few presidential candidates who has publicly endorsed Bitcoin. Last year, during the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, he announced that his campaign would accept Bitcoin (BTC) donations. The presidential hopeful also revealed that he purchased Bitcoin during the same year.

Despite being endorsed by some regulators, cryptocurrencies have remained a highly debated topic globally. Blockchain technology, on the other hand, has seen implementations across several avenues in the public sector, and regulators have been open-minded in their approach."

Shivaprasad is a professional artist whose work has been featured in several local exhibitions and posted on Instagram and Facebook. In October 2023, the scammers, claiming to be an “NFT art dealer,” introduced the artist to a platform dubbed nfttradeplace.com.

The scammer told the victim that they would like to purchase his paintings for 42 ETH, or INR 1.09 crore, a significant sum in India. The negotiations were all held virtually, via email and Facebook.

The digital artist took up the offer and listed three of his artworks for 10 ETH and another one for 12 ETH. On February 1, 2024, the victim was asked to pay 0.115 ETH to the scammer’s platform as a “gas fee.”

“The victim made the payment from his crypto wallet, which he set up at the scammer’s behest,” a cybercrime investigator was quoted saying.

Following the completion of his first sale, the artist requested a withdrawal of 6 ETH from his earnings. However, despite waiting for days, no transaction was initiated. Upon checking again, Shivaprasad was asked to pay a “delay fee” for supposedly holding up the withdrawal of his cryptocurrency.

“This delay fee was never discussed nor was it exhibited on the website,” the victim said in a statement.

He added that since he wasn’t in possession of any ETH, he had requested the scammers to accept the delay fees in fiat currency. The scammers agreed to this request, and the victim went on to make four payments to the accounts of Mohammed Ekramul Haque and Mohammad Farooq. It has not been confirmed whether these people are the masterminds behind this scam.

Shivaprasad made the last payment to the scammers on March 15. He noted that the platform “kept asking [him] for further payments” to be able to withdraw his 6 ETH.

On April 17, the victim contacted the cyber police and filed charges under 66C (punishment for identity theft) and 66D (punishment for cheating by personation by using computer resources) of the Information Technology (IT) Act and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

“It is highly difficult to trace cryptocurrency trails. As of now, bank details and domain details of the email address used by the scammers have been sought,” an officer familiar with the matter said.

Cryptocurrency scams have seen a significant uptick in India, despite crackdowns from local authorities. Last week, the nation’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) launched an investigation into a $800 million Ponzi scheme involving a Bollywood celebrity.

Yves Bennaïm, who leads the non-profit think tank 2B4CH driving this initiative, argued that integrating Bitcoin into the national bank’s reserves is critical for maintaining Switzerland’s “sovereignty and neutrality” growing global instability.

Speaking to a Swiss news outlet, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, on April 20, Bennaïm mentioned that they are finalizing the organizational setup and drafting necessary documents to be submitted to the State Chancellery in order to kick off the referendum.

Achieving the referendum’s signature requirement entails securing 100,000 signatures from Swiss citizens within 18 months, a hurdle that hampered 2B4CH’s initial bid in October 2021.

At that time, the “Bitcoin Initiative” initially aimed to incorporate Bitcoin as a reserve currency into Article 99-3 of the Swiss Federal Constitution.

Given Switzerland has a population of 8.77 million, this means about 1.15% of the populace must support the petition.

Luzius Meisser, who leads the Bitcoin-centric trading platform Bitcoin Suisse and collaborates with Bennaïm, stated that including Bitcoin would confirm Switzerland’s financial independence from the European Central Bank and reinforce its neutral position.

Meisser is prepared to discuss the advantages of adding Bitcoin to the central bank’s assets in a meeting with the Swiss National Bank on April 26, where he will be allotted three minutes to present his arguments.

His previous proposal in March 2022 for the bank to buy $1.1 billion in Bitcoin monthly instead of German government bonds was not accepted by Thomas Jordan, Chair of the Swiss National Bank, who in April 2022 declared that Bitcoin did not meet the necessary criteria to be considered a reserve currency.

Meisser believes that if the central bank had adopted his recommendation in 2022, it would now benefit from an additional $32.9 billion. He also cautioned that delays might lead to higher acquisition costs as other central banks might start buying Bitcoin.

Only 1 month has passed and 12 of the Solana presale meme coins have been completely abandoned after raising >180,650 SOL ($26.7M).

According to recent calculations done by blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, the identified set of pre-sale memecoins allocated over 180,650 SOL tokens, equivalent to approximately $28 million at the time of reporting.

Among the identified pre-sales, one user, going by the alias @pokeepandaa, raised over 52,000 SOL for the LIKE token, representing nearly 30% of the total identified memecoin pre-sales that were abandoned post-fundraising, according to ZachXBT’s calculations.

Starting from mid-March, it’s understood that more than 35 memecoin pre-sales have taken place in the Solana ecosystem, amassing over $150 million worth of SOL. However, not all of these projects followed the trajectory of the latest identified cohort, ZachXBT added. In a follow-up X post, the blockchain sleuth also noted that the same trend can now be observed on Base, a layer-2 solution developed by Coinbase.

As crypto.news reported earlier, the surge in memecoin prices has prompted the deployment of trading bots on the Solana network, aiming for arbitrage trades, which, when unavailable, result in failed transactions. Eventually, those failed transactions, labeled as “bot spam,” constituted the vast majority of the failed transactions on Solana, as per Helis CEO Mert Mumtaz."

Among the notable moves was ARK’s addition of 139,152 units of its in-house spot Bitcoin ETF — the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF — valued at $8.96 million.

The purchase followed another substantial buy of $31.19 million worth of the ETF the day before.

Not content with just Bitcoin, ARK doubled down on diversification by purchasing 41,068 shares of ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), totaling approximately $2.78 million.

This buy was also in addition to another $2.9 million worth of EETH shares the investment giant bought on April 18.

However, not all moves were about acquisitions. ARK also shed some weight in its portfolio, selling 28,936 shares of ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), amounting to approximately $803,552.

Analysts considered the transactions significant, particularly since they came just hours before the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event.

However, while the halving brought a sense of subdued sentiment to the crypto market after an earlier surge in anticipation, Wood said she remains undeterred in her confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, possibly indicated by her company’s gazumping of the BTC ETFs.

In a recent interview, she shared insights into ARK’s investment strategies, emphasizing her positive outlook on transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and, of course, the cryptocurrency sector.

Her firm has also made headlines in Europe with the launch of its first three European UCITS ETFs, expanding its global footprint and catering to the growing demand for its investment strategies.

The ETFs were listed on Deutsche Borse Xetra on April 18 and are slated for listing on additional European exchanges in the coming weeks."

Bankman-Fried, who founded FTX in 2019 and caused its bankruptcy in 2022, has agreed to cooperate in the class action lawsuit, according to Bloomberg.

High-profile celebrities helped market the crypto exchange in its heyday.

Adam Moskowitz, a class action attorney, filed the suit accusing the celebrity endorsers of deception and making false claims about the safety of crypto assets.

A group of FTX investors and customers has agreed to drop their claims against co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried in exchange for his cooperation against other defendants in lawsuits over the cryptocurrency exchange’s collapse. https://t.co/9xmQo0rgpi — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) April 19, 2024

The crypto exchange once boasted significant popularity and influence, with Bankman-Fried showing adeptness at leveraging celebrity endorsements to facilitate the platform’s meteoric rise.

It resulted in a staggering $32 billion fortune for Bankman-Fried and placed FTX among the top three largest crypto exchanges in the world before everything came crumbling down.

The FTX collapse led to a cascade of legal actions, culminating in the sentencing of Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison for his role in defrauding customers of the exchange.

The former CEO has appealed against his conviction and sentence and is currently held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, pending transfer to prison.

These figures stand accused of promoting unregistered securities on FTX, a charge that, if proven, could have profound implications for their legal standing.

Celebrities and FTX

Shaquille O’Neal was formally served with the FTX class-action lawsuit during an NBA game in March 2023.

The lawsuit alleges that the “FTX: I Am All In” marketing campaign, prominently featuring O’Neal, deceitfully influenced consumers to engage with FTX, culminating in financial losses following the exchange’s collapse.

Tom Brady is reported to have lost a staggering $30 million in the collapse of FTX, mostly made up of now-worthless shares that were part of his arrangement with the exchange in 2021 when he served as an “ambassador.”

Bundchen, his former spouse, also reportedly suffered losses of $18 million on defunct stock investments tied to FTX.

Larry David told The Associated Press that he had lost “a lot of money” after things went south for FTX. He also called himself an “idiot” for seeking advice from his friends who were supposedly knowledgeable about crypto and who assured him that the company was legitimate.

The investors embroiled in the litigation harbor hopes of getting back a portion of their losses incurred from the collapse of FTX. Bankman-Fried could be in a position to bolster their case against the celebrity endorsers.

If approved by a judge, their agreement will lead to the dropping of civil liabilities against Bankman-Fried now and in the future. In exchange, the ex-CEO will provide non-privileged documents detailing his assets and investments, as well as information on defendants in the civil case."

Crypto Valley Exchange

The $7-million funding round consisted of pre-seed and seed rounds. Fabric Ventures and Kyber Capital Crypto Fund co-led the effort.

Crypto Valley Exchange also drew support from notable backers like AMDAX, Wave Digital, Funfair Ventures, and the Seier Capital Family Office, among others.

CVEX is set to offer a decentralized exchange (DEX) catering to crypto enthusiasts, aiming to provide transparent and cost-effective futures and options trading. One of its features includes specialized bid-offer dynamics that the company hopes will work better than existing trading platforms.

Regarding its upcoming mainnet launch, scheduled for this summer on Arbitrum (ARB), CVEX stated it will include enhanced trading features compatible with user wallets across Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), and Solana (SOL).

With nearly 160,000 users already signed up for early access during its testnet phase, the team behind CVEX hopes it could disrupt the derivatives market landscape.

We’re bringing established risk approaches on-chain, allowing proper risk management and real hedging strategies to be applied, which will open up defi derivatives to everyone from degens to big institutions and facilitate much greater volumes of trading liquidity. James Davies, Chief Product Officer, CVEX

Centrifuge

In other funding news, Centrifuge, a leading platform for on-chain finance, also announced a substantial $15 million Series A funding round.

The round, which was oversubscribed and supported by a diverse array of investors, is considered a pivotal moment for Centrifuge’s journey toward establishing itself as the go-to platform for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.

Centrifuge plans to launch an institutional-grade lending market for RWAs on the Base layer-2 network, which it also plans to integrate with Coinbase Verification.

According to the company, the initiative is meant to enable swift and secure onboarding for institutions seeking exposure to real-world assets, and it will also provide instant liquidity and lending options against asset holdings.

According to Nebra, the funding round included participation from several angel investors, including Tim Beiko, Kartik Talwar, and Nick White, among others.

The organization said it hopes the infusion of capital will help it create a “shared settlement layer” for web3. The layer could help reduce proof settlement costs on major blockchains, including Ethereum.

Nascent co-founder Dan Elitzer likened Nebra’s approach to advancing blockchain ZKP settlements to how major technology companies like Google and Uber aggregated resources in their respective fields to change how those sectors work.

This decision by HashKey adds to the challenges faced by Binance on a global scale. In February, the Nigerian government banned Binance due to concerns about currency speculation in the country.

Teng addressed Gambaryan’s predicament, assuring that the company was actively engaging with the Nigerian government to resolve the matter.

He also emphasized Binance’s dedication to collaborating with global law enforcement agencies to combat financial crimes.

On his part, COO Perlman spoke about the hurdles posed by the monitoring agreement with U.S. regulators, which came as a result of Binance’s plea agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, after the exchange admitted guilt to money laundering charges brought against it and agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement to resolve the case.

Adding to the uncertainty, ZKasino’s official Telegram channel was rumored to have been banned, but crypto.news confirmed that the account is still active.

ZKasino hasn’t responded to requests for comment.

A significant concern also arose from the revelation that ZKasino’s deposit wallet holds a substantial amount of 10,500 Ether (ETH), valued at around $32 million. It has led to questions about the platform’s financial activities and management practices.

The issue has become especially pertinent given previous accusations of fraud against the ZKasino team. These allegations — highlighted in an X post by ZigZag founder Kedar Iyer — have contributed to a growing sense of distrust around ZKasino.

Speaking with CNBC on April 19, Hougan regarded this year’s Bitcoin (BTC) halving as a “buy the news” opportunity for investors interested in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency asset class.

“If you look historically at halvings, the price action within a week or two after the Bitcoin halving is relatively muted. But if you look out at a year, BTC prices have rallied substantially after each of the past three halvings and I think it will do so again.” Matt Hougan, Bitwise CIO

The halving is a pre-installed code change designed by anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto to throttle BTC inflation and maintain supply scarcity. Nakamoto built the system to slash mining rewards by 50% every 210,000 blocks or four years.

As block mining rewards are halved, so is the amount of new BTC entering circulation. Many believe this reduced supply, combined with increasing demand through spot Bitcoin ETFs, will result in higher prices by next year. Hougan, whose company is a BTC ETF issuer, sides with this sentiment.

“The amount of new supply of Bitcoin coming into the market is being cut in half. We’re removing $11 billion of annual supply. I think big picture, that has to be good for price and that’s what I would expect over the next year.” Matt Hougan, Bitwise CIO

Bitcoin halving to solidify spot BTC ETF demand

Coinpass CEO Jeff Hancock told crypto.news that Bitcoin has matured from a hobby and speculative market into a real asset with institutional interest. It is bound to make this cycle different, especially in a high inflation, high-interest rate economy, Hancock said.

“A historic market opportunity could present itself this Bitcoin cycle, after the 4th halving event. Bitcoin ETFs have already successfully launched in the US, we now have pending ETFs in Hong Kong, ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, and Bitcoin prices are already pushing all-time highs before the halving, something that has never happened before.

In an amended complaint against Sun, the SEC claimed that his frequent visits to the United States gave rise to legal action. The Commission said in its updated complaint that Sun spent more than 380 days in the United States between 2017 and 2019. The department also believes Sun manipulated the TRX secondary market through wash trading.

Sun’s business trips included major cities such as New York, Boston, and San Francisco. According to the SEC, entrepreneurs with controlled companies purposefully took actions in the United States directed against them.

“During Sun’s business trips to the United States in 2019, he spent time in various cities, including New York City, Boston, Massachusetts, and San Francisco. Rainberry also rented an apartment where Sun stayed during some of his business trips to the United States in 2019.” SEC statement

The original lawsuit regarding TRX token wash trading allegations involved an unnamed platform. This time, the Commission clarified that it was a Bittrex exchange.

According to the SEC, Sun personally communicated with the platform team regarding TRX’s listing in 2018. The entrepreneur also personally signed many documents related to the company’s attributes.

The department considered that the fact that Bittrex is based in the United States also confirms the right of jurisdiction over the defendants. The exchange and its head settled the SEC’s claims in August 2023, agreeing to pay $24 million. Before this, Bittrex unsuccessfully challenged the agency’s authority to regulate cryptocurrencies.

At the Token2049 conference in Dubai, Durov explained how ordinary Telegram users can use Toncoin (TON). Starting on April 19, the first payments in TON for advertising to Telegram channel administrators will begin. In addition, starting next week, users will be able to leave tips to administrators in TON, with content makers receiving a portion of the income.

Buying and selling stickers in TON as NFTs will also be possible, and sticker artists will receive 95% of the proceeds. Telegram will also have mini-applications where users can buy content for crypto. Telegram users can also share TON with other contacts in correspondence.

“Imagine if someone owned this sticker as an NFT when it came out a few years ago. I think the price increases with the challenge. What we’ve experienced with again, stickers are very, very popular.” Pavel Durov, Telegram Founder

The founder of Telegram noted that messenger users will also be able to log into their accounts using cryptocurrency wallets. In addition, it will soon be possible to register the rights to an account’s name so users can sell it if they wish.

Per the Telegram founder, all innovations will be available to all users, and no programming skills will be required to use the new functions.

“For the first time in social media history, you can directly own your username, sell it, put it up for auction, buy multiple usernames, and attach them to your account. “ Pavel Durov, Telegram Founder

TON recently appeared on the list of blockchain networks on which the largest stablecoin operates by capitalization. The first rumors about the launch of USDT in TON appeared in early April when a joint speech by Telegram founder Durov and Tether head Paolo Ardoino was announced at a crypto conference in Dubai."

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is probing Raj Kundra, a prominent businessman and husband of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, concerning a money laundering case linked to a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme dubbed ‘Gain Bitcoin.’ Notably, Kundra is not the main suspect in this investigation.

In the ongoing probe, the ED has confiscated assets worth roughly $12 million, including a Mumbai flat owned by Shilpa Shetty.

Launched in 2017 by Ajay Bhardwaj and Mahendra Bhardwaj, ‘Gain Bitcoin’ promised investors a return of 10% per month, payable in Bitcoin, and quickly amassed about $800 million.

The scheme initially operated by distributing returns to early investors using the funds from new participants. However, as recruiting new investors became challenging, the payouts stopped. The organizers then converted the remaining funds into Bitcoins and hid them in anonymous digital wallets.

Investigations have revealed that Kundra received 285 Bitcoins, now worth over $18 million, from Amit Bhardwaj, the promoter behind the scheme. The tokens were purportedly intended for a Bitcoin mining project in Ukraine that never materialized, and reports suggest Kundra still holds them.

Kundra and Shetty have denied any links to the scheme and remain confident they will be cleared of all charges once the investigation is completed.

The emergence of the ‘Gain Bitcoin’ scam coincides with increased scrutiny by Indian regulators over illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies.

Last month, the Enforcement Directorate escalated its efforts by filing a charge sheet against 299 entities under India’s stringent anti-money laundering laws. The legal action was a response to a series of frauds where investors were misled by promises related to crypto mining ventures.

Furthermore, the landscape of cryptocurrency scams in India is evolving, with a new pattern emerging among fraudsters. Recently, there has been a rise in scams where perpetrators pose as job recruiters. These malicious actors target unsuspecting job seekers, offering them roles that purportedly involve dealings in cryptocurrencies or related projects, only to defraud them."

The Bitcoin halving is almost here, and all eyes are on the flagship cryptocurrency. This key event will slash block rewards in half, affecting the premiere cryptocurrency’s supply and availability.

Investors and market observers are currently divided on how such an event might impact Bitcoin’s future trajectory. Some claim that Bitcoin will follow past trends, while others believe this market cycle is different.

Kadan Stadelmann, who has been leading Komodo since 2016, shared a number of insights on the what the future may hold for Bitcoin.

What are your thoughts on this Bitcoin halving? Do you think the halving will drive public interest in crypto?

Each Bitcoin halving is important because it reduces the amount of new BTC mined each block, leading to supply shock. Because Bitcoin halvings have historically kicked off new bull market cycles, there is a lot of optimism surrounding them within the crypto community. As a result of price increases, mainstream media outlets have started to talk about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more positively and more often, which leads to greater interest from retail investors and institutional investors alike.

What about the risks? Will the halving impact the number of miners since the costs per token will double? What effect would that have, if any?

There is a definite possibility that the 2024 halving or future halvings will reduce mining profitability, leading to fewer miners. However, if the price per Bitcoin continues to increase over time, it should at least partially offset the potential losses from the reduced mining reward. We’re also likely to see more large-scale corporate enterprises begin to mine Bitcoin.

Institutional demand has been touted as a key propellent for sparking the 2024 bull run. Do you think the demand is big enough to create a supply shock?

There is enough institutional demand to create a supply shock. From the demand side, the inflow of capital into Bitcoin ETFs has been massive. It took just seven weeks to reach the same inflow level that took gold ETFs three years to achieve. MicroStrategy is also ramping up its purchases. On March 11, Michael Saylor announced the purchase of 12,000 BTC for $821.7 million and days later announced plans to raise an additional $500 million to acquire more. From the supply side, April’s Bitcoin halving will reduce new supply issued by one-half. Combined, these events are enough to create a major sense of FOMO among investors.

Do you mean the demand is already priced, or is it yet to kick in?

During the early part of the current market cycle, it appears that retail demand is lagging behind institutional demand. However, it’s also possible that a large percentage of retail demand from this cycle is being met by spot Bitcoin ETFs. In other words, there is potentially a cohort of first-time crypto investors who have chosen to purchase Bitcoin indirectly via ETFs, rather than via crypto exchanges.

And do you think the halving will inspire confidence among retail investors?

Generally speaking, the halving inspires market confidence for a couple of reasons. First, it’s a counter-narrative to fiat currency. Investors know that Bitcoin is becoming more deflationary, consistently every four years. Meanwhile, fiat currency is becoming more inflationary on a regular basis, as demonstrated by this week’s disappointing US economic numbers (CPI and PPI). Second, the entire crypto market is usually propelled by the success of Bitcoin. Bitcoin typically gains more market value post-halving, leading to a lot of media attention. As a result, so do numerous other cryptocurrencies.

We have seen in the past that altcoins always tend to follow Bitcoin. Do you see any particular altcoin benefiting from the halving?

It’s difficult to pinpoint one specific cryptocurrency that is likely to benefit the most from the Bitcoin halving. Rather, the vast majority of cryptocurrencies will likely go up in value sometime during the second half of 2024 and through early 2025. When deciding which cryptocurrency to buy, it’s crucial to look at whether it offers long-term value — independent of crypto market trends — by considering factors such as tokenomics, technology, and use cases.

Coming to the most anticipated question, how do you estimate the price of Bitcoin to respond after halving? Let’s say after a 3-month or a 6-month period.

BTC may trade sideways for 3 months after the halving, due to sell-offs from miners. However, across the longer term (i.e. 6 to 12 months), BTC price should increase if the historical post-halving trend repeats itself this cycle. I expect this bull cycle to go strong through 2025, and would not be surprised to see it continue up from there with the institutional demand being seen so early.

And what about the more immediate implications of halving the Bitcoin price?

The price of Bitcoin is highly volatile, leading up to the halving. Although the market looks very bearish at the moment, this has been the norm around previous halvings. During the post-halving period, just when people think Bitcoin will remain dormant or even bearish, the market historically wakes up extremely quickly.

So, are you bullish on Bitcoin?

I am bullish on the mid to long-term future of Bitcoin. Based on the current amount of new adoption among institutional investors and the proliferation of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin may reach $100k by the end of the year. After a major Bitcoin rally starts, we are likely to see a market-wide rally for most altcoins later this year or early 2025."

Spectra Chain, which recently launched its Layer 2 solutions on April 16, is known for its Proof of Stake consensus mechanism designed to improve scalability, lower transaction costs, and enable the development of complex smart contracts. The ecosystem also comprises a Chain Explorer for enhanced transparency and security, a Decentralized Exchange (DEX), and an NFT Marketplace for digital asset trading.

However, the community’s confidence was shaken when several SPCT token holders reported on social media platform X that the official Telegram channel of Spectra Chain had been abruptly closed.

The user found apparent connections between the founders of Spectra Chain and those involved in VC Spectra, a project previously identified as a rug pull.

He went on to suggest that the project might soon face a collapse, particularly if the team’s promised transparency or “team dox” is proven to be deceptive or indefinitely delayed.

Per a Dec. 21 Medium post by a private investigator, Michael Gugliotti, VC Spectra has been evading multiple launch dates and adjusting their token goals on their website, which further compounds the mistrust.

Gugliotti mentioned, “After an interaction with someone claiming to be the accounts manager, a client of mine found their account suspended and all forms of communication cut off. We have since reported this as a fraud to agencies including the FBI, FTC, and SEC.”

This situation is not isolated within the crypto industry. For instance, on April 15, Grand Base’s token value dropped nearly 100% following an incident where the protocol’s deployer minted millions of new tokens.

The sudden increase in token supply led to suspicions of a rug pull, which were later attributed to an exploit by the project’s spokesperson via a Telegram channel statement."

https://crypto.news/jeremy-allaire-offers-new-insights-into-usdc-expansion-at-token2049/,Jeremy Allaire offers new insights into USDC expansion at Token2049,2024-04-19 10:45:15+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, recently discussed USDC’s operations and the growing importance of stablecoins within the global economy.

“We’re now seeing essentially stablecoin rules coming into place all around the world. And alongside that, that’s enabling us to really expand the market infrastructure that supports USDC,” Allaire said during a fireside chat at Token2049 in Dubai on April 19.

In 2024, regulators worldwide moved to create a regulated environment for stablecoins. While the U.S. saw politicians calling for outright bans, authorities in the EU seemed eager to regular the asset class. According to Allaire, such regulatory frameworks have been advantageous for expanding USDC’s market infrastructure.

Highlighting Circle’s global initiatives, Allaire shared details about Cricle’s plans to set up local banking infrastructures in key financial centers, including Singapore, Hong Kong, and the European Union.

Further, the CEO revealed that the stablecoin issuer has already started rolling out natively in Brazil and Mexico.

Circle is “working with dozens of banks and advancing the technology of the protocols.” Circle currently exists on 16 different blockchain networks and protocols, Allaire stated, stressing the technological strides being made. These efforts are significantly enhancing USDC’s adaptability and reach as a stable digital currency.

The Circle CEO also touched upon the evolving role of money as a tool for business and banking efficiencies.

Money as a utility “is going to be hugely valuable for the biggest corporations in the world in developed markets, and it’s going to be hugely valuable in international markets,” Allaire noted, suggesting a shift towards digital currencies that serve broader, more strategic roles than traditional fiat currencies.

Furthermore, Allaire also pointed out the importance of stablecoins in cross-border finance, noting that the role of stablecoins in this area is “very significant.” He went on to tout stablecoins as a means to facilitate a smoother and cost-effective payment channel.

The Circle CEO considers this a crucial feature in a globalized economy where financial transactions often span multiple countries.

Per Allaire, Circle’s commitment to technological innovation was evident in its development of new protocols, such as the “cross-chain transfer protocol.” Allaire initially announced this protocol in January 2023 and claims that it enhances USDC’s fluidity across different blockchain ecosystems.

“We’re making that infrastructure faster and easier to use, and then working with developers in hundreds of countries now who are building on top of those protocols and building applications, utilities, and other things to help grow the stablecoin network,” the Circle CEO added.

The fireside chat concluded with a forward-looking discussion about the future challenges and opportunities within the stablecoin ecosystem, prompted by Arslanian’s inquiries about recent market fluctuations and the outlook for digital currencies.

“I think if we’re talking about what’s going to be used for real economic activity that is going to be used by households in terms of financial institutions, you’re going to need to have legal forms of digital currency money, and those are going to be regulated issuers. And those are going to be fully reserved,” Allaire concluded."

JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG don’t expect big changes for Bitcoin’s price after the halving, saying the market has already mostly priced in this software update, which occurs once every four years. According to a Bloomberg report, the focus will now shift toward the implications for Bitcoin mining, with expectations of consolidation among publicly-traded firms gaining market share as unprofitable miners exit the network.

“Publicly-listed Bitcoin miners are well positioned to take advantage of the new environment, mainly due to greater access to funding and in particular equity financing. This helps them to scale their operations and invest into more efficient equipment.” JPMorgan analysts

Similarly, analysts at German financial giant Deutsche Bank also foresee no significant increase in Bitcoin prices post-halving, saying the network’s algorithm has already accounted for the update.

The halving, which reduces the mining reward every four years by half, is anticipated to arrive on Apr. 19 at 22:07 (UTC), according to data from NiceHash. Historically, shortly after Bitcoin halvings, the crypto industry witnessed a decline in the hashrate, indicating a reduction in mining capacity as less profitable miners exit the market, according to Deutsche Bank analysts.

In December 2022, Eisenberg was arrested in Puerto Rico, facing charges of commodities fraud, market manipulation, and wire fraud linked to the Mango Markets exploit. The incident occurred in October 2022 when Eisenberg injected $5 million of USDC stablecoin into Mango Markets.

According to court findings, Eisenberg manipulated the price of MNGO, the platform’s token, causing it to surge approximately 1,000% in one hour. The artificial increase allowed him to borrow and withdraw additional tokens, creating a significant negative debt position for the platform.

A few days after the exploit, Eisenberg claimed that his actions were part of a legal, highly profitable trading strategy, utilizing the platform’s features as intended. He later returned $67 million to Mango Markets, retaining $47 million as per a community governance vote.

Wood is a blockchain developer with a decade of experience who is credited with co-founding multiple major decentralized networks, including Ethereum (ETH), Polkadot (DOT), and Kusama (KSM).

The University of York alumni is also particularly known as the original author of Ethereum’s Yellow Paper, the formal definition of crypto’s second-largest blockchain after Bitcoin (BTC).

Gavin Wood: Polkadot JAM chain is a protocol, not software

Gavin Wood’s presentation at the Token2024 blockchain conference in Dubai introduced the Joint-Accumulate Machine or JAM chain as a protocol first and foremost rather than software. According to the Polkadot co-creator, JAM is designed to be faster and more decentralized in architecture and development expertise.

“JAM is permissionless in nature, allowing anyone to deploy code as a service on it for a fee commensurate with the resources this code utilizes and to induce execution of this code through the procurement and allocation of core-time, a metric of resilient and ubiquitous computation, somewhat similar to the purchasing of gas in Ethereum. We already envision a Polkadot-compatible CoreChains service.” JAM Gray Paper

Wood explained that Polkadot’s JAM Chain will deliver smart contract functionality through a decentralized hybrid system. Wood’s thesis revealed similarities with Ethereum’s EVM but pivoted to a new PMB paradigm driven by Polkadot’s underlying infrastructure.

Wood implored interested participants and contributors to study JAM’s Gray Paper.

Furthermore, the Polkadot co-creator pointed to the JAM prize initiative backed by the Web3 Foundation to incentivize interactions. The fund will reward developers across various tiers of JAM implementations. Builders will also have access to a full-scale replica of the chain called the JAM toaster, which is built to help with debugging and optimization.

Wood said the Polkadot Fellowship, the technical body in charge of Polkadot upgrades, will finalize all tooling and software specifications needed to run the JAM chain once a proposal is published in the coming months."

Ali highlighted a notable shift in the challenges faced by Stacks within the Bitcoin ecosystem, with an increased focus on creativity and solution diversity at a panel during Dubai’s Token2049 event

“The biggest problem with Bitcoin right now is that there’s so many different, like L2s and protocols,” Ali began, referencing a recent tweet by Kyle Smani of Multicoin. The Stacks co-founder emphasized this as a positive shift from previous perceptions that nobody ever wanted to build on Bitcoin (BTC).

Ali described the current phase as Bitcoin season two, indicative of a mature, bustling free market where developers actively engage with the platform.

Ali conveyed optimism for the Bitcoin ecosystem, noting that multiple solutions — potentially over 2,000 — are proposed when developers are encouraged to innovate. Although not all will succeed, the diversity of approaches is a positive sign of the ecosystem’s vitality and creativity.

He pointed out the low percentage of capital currently deployed in the market because investors don’t want to spend Layer 1 Bitcoin, seeing it as an indicator of the nascent stage of Layer 2 development.

“Depending on the market price of $1.2 trillion in capital, less than 1% of L2s right now are actually deployed. So we are at a very, very early stage and I would like to see that number move to 1%, 5%, 10% at some point.” Muneeb Ali

Furthermore, Ali addressed the technical and infrastructural hurdles Bitcoin faces, particularly in terms of transaction mechanics. He expressed how the Lightning network did not accomplish what it meant to do and had hope for improvements that would simplify Bitcoin transactions, making them as easy and efficient as modern payment systems.

Ali questioned the possibility of achieving extremely fast and cost-effective Bitcoin transactions on Layer 2 networks, highlighting this as a vital area for development to improve user experience and extend Bitcoin’s appeal."

Experts from the blockchain industry discussed the latest innovations and development opportunities during a panel discussion at the Token2049 conference in Dubai.

The discussion participants also touched upon the Ethereum blockchain, which is considered the dominant smart contract platform. According to the panelists, Ethereum has scalability problems due to low transaction throughput, leading to high gas fees and network congestion. New blockchains are designed to become more scalable by increasing transaction speeds.

Experts recognized developers’ interest in developing Ethereum due to its first-mover advantage and brand recognition. However, some argue that many layer 1 alternatives can better serve different use cases than Ethereum in its current form.

Raj Gokal, co-founder of Solana, noted that developers and most Ethereum users also have Solana wallets. In addition, he said the growth of transaction volume on Solana exceeded Ethereum indicators.

“We’re doing well, but Ethereum is not.” Raj Gokal, Solana Co-Founder

Emin Gun Sirer, founder and CEO of Ava Labs, noted that the Avalanche blockchain was never positioned as an ‘Ethereum killer.’ Despite these concerns, Ethereum has several advantages, including creating blockchains according to the developers’ rules.

“We allow other people to launch their own blockchains according to their own rules. This is something that Ethereum is just fundamentally incapable of.” Emin Gun Sirer, founder and CEO of Ava Labs

In conclusion, Monad’s Keone Hon noted that Ethereum ultimately needs much better performance to reach hundreds of millions of users.

Last November, Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin announced his intention to redesign the network. Buterin outlined a general strategy that he will use to improve Ethereum (ETH) staking and solve performance problems arising about addresses.

During the Emerging Trends in Consumer web3 Apps panel at Token2049 in Dubai, speakers discussed tokenizing user attention and the role of meme coins in this development.

Imran Khan from AllianceDAO noted that a new direction is emerging in the blockchain industry today —attention tokenization, which also applies to the meme coin industry. Many projects launched over the past few years are using memes to increase their audience, with Khan adding that people are incentivized based on a token similar to what they think.

Backpack founder Tristan Yver also expressed that all the attention is now focused on meme coins. With this token type, new user onboarding is happening in the crypto industry.

Investor Santiago Roel Santos agreed, noting that attention tokenization also applies to meme coins, which have taken over the crypto industry in recent months despite having a short half-life. According to him, the crypto industry may underestimate the power of meme coins, calling them “not real”. In reality, meme coins are very “powerful”.

“They’ve been around since humans have walked on Earth, so they’re very important instruments.” Santiago Roel Santos, investor

However, the panelists disagreed on whether meme coins are vital in consumer web3 applications and attention tokenization. At the same time, the speakers noted their critical role in the cryptocurrency industry.

Meanwhile, meme coins continue to set records. As noted in a CoinGecko report, the tokens significantly outperformed all other sectors of the crypto market in the first quarter of 2024, delivering an average return of 1,313% across the top ten tokens.

Compared to other sectors, such as real-world assets (RWA) and AI-based tokens, meme coins have maintained a dominant lead in profitability and highlighted the dynamic and speculative nature of the current cryptocurrency market landscape."

Two sources familiar with the development claim that the exchange has agreed to pay a $2 million penalty to the regulator for non-compliance. However, they did not confirm how the fine has been calculated.

India, according to a Chainalysis report, is one of the fastest-growing crypto economies, with the highest adoption rate as of 2023. With its re-entry, Binance will become the second FIU-compliant foreign cryptocurrency exchange to tap into this market, closely following KuCoin.

Prior to being banned in January, Binance reportedly accounted for more than 90% of the Indian crypto trading volume. The surge in popularity was primarily driven by traders trying to bypass tax implications imposed by the Indian government.

Global cryptocurrency exchanges not registered in India were reportedly causing INR 3000 crores (approx. USD 361.45 million) in tax leakage annually. This was one of the key motivators for the FIU to ban unregistered foreign exchanges in the nation.

One of the sources familiar with the matter was quoted saying that it is “unfortunate that it took (Binance) more than two years to realize there is no room for negotiations, and (that) no global powerhouse can command special treatment, especially at the cost of exposing the country’s financial system to vulnerabilities.”

As part of the FIU registration, Binance will now be bound to the same rules as the local cryptocurrency exchanges. This includes a 1% tax deduction at source (TDS), which has already been implemented by KuCoin along with the Indian crypto exchanges.

The FIU had banned nine foreign exchanges from the nation. While KuCoin and Binance have complied with the regulators, OKX, another prominent exchange on the list, has ceased all operations in India. In an email to its customers, the platform cited regulatory burden as the cause.

“These developments aim to ensure that crypto exchanges operate in compliance with regulations like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), laying the groundwork for a more compliant ecosystem,” Sumit Gupta, CEO of CoinDCX, told crypto.news in a statement.

He added that the “focus on regulatory compliance” will play a key role in building a sustainable crypto environment in India."

Announced on April 18, Megadrop is primarily a token launch platform that will host airdrops and Web3 quests by integrating the Binance Simple Earn program and the Binance Web3 Wallet. The goal, per Binance, is to make the airdrop experience more engaging for users.

The platform exclusively allows access to select web3 projects before they are officially listed on the global exchange. Users can do this either by locking their BNB holdings for a certain period of time under its Locked product program or by completing Web3 quests and earning points in their Binance Web3 wallet.

The scores accumulated from this will be based on the amount of BNB locked and the duration for which it has been locked. For Web3 quests, the score will calculated based on the number of quests users complete. It must be noted that certain multipliers will also be applied when calculating the total scores

Users will earn rewards based on their total score. The rewards will be made available under the Megadrop section on the Binance app.

“This unique combination of engagement, education and rewards positions Megadrop as an unparalleled interactive experience within both Binance and the broader crypto ecosystem,” the exchange wrote in a blogpost.

Binance unveiled BounceBit (BB), a Bitcoin restaking chain, as the first project to launch on the new platform. Megadrop users will be entitled to earn up to 8% of the token supply, accounting for 168,000,000 BB tokens.

The launch closely follows Binance securing a full virtual-asset services provider (VASP) license by Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). The approval came a year after the exchange entered the third stage of the nation’s four-stage process.

“As we secure the esteemed full market VASP Licence, it notably amplifies our unwavering commitment to advancing the financial landscape through compliance and innovation,” said Binance CEO Richard Teng.

According to a Bloomberg report, the approval came after Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao agreed to relinquish his voting rights for the local entity. Zhao is currently awaiting sentencing following his settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice."
https://crypto.news/arkansas-state-house-passes-bills-to-limit-cryptocurrency-mining/,Arkansas State House passes bills to limit cryptocurrency mining,2024-04-18 10:59:27+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","The Arkansas State House has approved two bills that could see a ban on crypto mining activities within the state.

At present, the bills are still under consideration and have yet to progress to full-fledged legislation; they establish the framework for further discussions leading to potential legislation.

On April 17, senators held a Senate hearing to discuss general concerns such as noise reduction, foreign ownership, and the closeness of cryptocurrency mining to residential areas.

Two of the eight bills that were introduced to the House on April 17 were successfully enacted, whereas the Senate approved only one bill pertaining to cryptocurrencies last week.

There is a lot of disagreement over whether Act 851 should be revised and how much detail those revisions should include. The committees will discuss the issue before potentially approving legislation during the current fiscal session or the following one.

According to the bill, the Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023 aims to regulate the Bitcoin mining business in the American state by defining rules for miners and safeguarding them from discriminatory restrictions and taxes.

Bitcoin mining’s lengthy and energy-intensive operation is being criticized for the waste it generates. According to Investopedia, bitcoin mining generates more than 77 kilotons of electrical waste per year.

Crypto mining also poses legal issues outside of the U.S. Paraguay senators submitted a bill to temporarily outlaw crypto mining and associated activities in the South American country, claiming that illegal crypto mines are stealing power and disrupting the electrical supply.

The proposed legislation seeks to restrict the installation of crypto mining facilities as well as operations involving the creation, preservation, storage, and trading of cryptocurrency.

However, Paraguayan senators have stalled work on the mining prohibition, and officials are now evaluating the advantages of selling excess energy from its Itaipu hydroelectric project to miners.

Miners are under pressure due to this week’s scheduled Bitcoin halving. According to Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, miners may liquidate $5 billion worth of Bitcoin in the months following the halving.

“The overhang from this selling could last four to six months, explaining why Bitcoin might go sideways for the next few months — as it has done following past halvings,” he said in a statement.

Thielen went on to say that this might happen again, with crypto markets facing “a significant challenge in a six-month ‘summer’ lull.”

Despite these challenges, the CEOs of leading crypto mining companies Marathon Digital Holdings, Riot Platforms, and CleanSpark remain optimistic, as earlier reported by crypto.news.

The mining companies’ cost-efficient operations, advanced mining technology, and increased demand for cryptocurrencies are potential compensatory factors for an anticipated $10 billion annual revenue loss due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving.

The mining firms remain hopeful that the surge in demand driven by new spot ETFs will bolster Bitcoin’s price sufficiently to offset the adverse effects of the update. Since their introduction by traditional asset management firms in January, these ETFs have attracted a total cumulative net inflow of $12.27 billion, as per data by crypto finance research platform SoSo Value."

The head of Ava Labs, Emin Gün Sirer, says Avalanche “was never ever” designed to be an “Ethereum killer,” adding that the definition was developed by marketing managers at Consensys, a blockchain tech firm founded by Joseph Lubin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum. Addressing the misconception at the Token2049 conference, Sirer noted that Avalanche “has always been complimentary to Ethereum.”

“We never ever marketed Avalanche as an Ethereum killer. That is a phrase that some marketing people at Consensys actually use to elevate Ethereum. We’ve always been complimentary to Ethereum.” Emin Gün Sirer

While acknowledging Ethereum’s role in the blockchain ecosystem, Sirer highlighted Avalanche’s unique capability to deploy independent blockchains with different rules, a feature he added Ethereum “fundamentally is incapable of.”

“Ethereum is a single-chain system [and] Avalanche is a multi-chain system. We can do many more things that they can’t do. And one of the most important ones is we allow other people to launch their own blockchains according to their own rules. This is something that Ethereum just fundamentally is incapable of.” Emin Gün Sirer

Addressing competition, Sirer emphasized Avalanche’s consensus protocols, noting their superior speed compared to Ethereum’s, noting that Avalanche’s protocol “puts us in a different game.”

“My competition is with the Wall Street. My competition is not with my good friends in the Ethereum community, of which I’m a part still.” Emin Gün Sirer

Reiterating Avalanche’s mission, Sirer underscored the platform’s commitment to advancing blockchain technology by “bringing new tokens, new assets into the blockchain space.”

In August 2022, the whistleblower website Crypto Leaks published an extensive expose alleging that Ava Labs paid the crypto-focused law firm Freedman Roche in tokens and equity to file a series of class-action lawsuits against competitors. At the time, Sirer dismissed the claims as “conspiracy theory nonsense,” emphasizing that the firm “would never engage in the unlawful, unethical and just plain wrong behavior claimed in these self-serving videos and inflammatory article.”"

“I expect more and more of the on-chain governments as well as some of the other off-chaining decisions to be made by AI, where the population, the token holder shareholders or the kind population of, of the unit of governments are really serve as a veto.” Illia Polosukhin

The NEAR Protocol co-founder added that AI models could potentially be responsible for things like gathering information and making decisions based on various criteria, while the human members within DAOs would act as checks and balances.

He also emphasized that AI-powered governance could help DAOs maximize token value, a task that might be challenging for human participants alone as coordinating the number of stakeholders is “extremely complex and it requires pretty much summarizing information, providing context.”

The integration of AI into DAO governance emerges as a pivotal topic in the crypto community, underscoring its potential to revolutionize decision-making processes in the rapidly evolving industry.

Teng provided an in-depth analysis of the evolving regulatory landscape. “Stablecoins are an important conduit into crypto. We have seen it in Europe now […] In the UK. I’ve seen a lot of chatter, I’ve seen a lot of different discussions about the same business like the US and other jurisdictions,” he remarked.

Matthew Roszak, co-founder and chairman of Bloq, contributed to the discussion by questioning the future of stablecoins and their impact on traditional banking. “It’s kind of like a competitive advantage to be able to do those types of things. But it’s interesting the nature of stablecoins today and just the concentration in US bonds is top ten holder, right?”

Roszak further speculated on the next generation of stablecoins, which might rely more on algorithmic processes or different assets to maintain stability without depending on traditional financial systems.

Boring then addressed the elephant in the room, asking Teng about the case of the detained Binance executive Tigran Gambarayan. Teng said, “we are working very closely with the Nigerian government to try to resolve the matter,” adding that [Gambarayan] “made it his mission to work with global law enforcement agencies to fight financial crimes.”"

“There are large swaths of threat intel hidden away in private messages and group chats, intel that might help in recovering funds, tracking down a threat actor, or identifying future victims.” Samczsun, Paradigm researcher and SEAL 911 member

Today, we're launching the latest @_SEAL_Org initiative, and it's going to change crypto security forever. It's called SEAL-ISAC, and this is why we need it pic.twitter.com/Ra6Vl3jfd3 — samczsun (@samczsun) April 17, 2024

Samczsun, also known as Sam, explained that while this trove of data exists, a means to organize, correlate, and distribute the info was previously unavailable. SEAL-ISAC solves this problem, the researcher wrote in an X thread on April 17.

The ISAC idea is not exclusive to blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Any organization that fosters threat intel sharing may qualify under this category. Most Web2 financial firms leverage the FS-ISAC, and Samczsun believes SEAL-ISAC could serve all of Web3 in the same manner.

SEAL 911 assembled after defi hack onslaught

SEAL 911 comprises dozens of auditors, crypto whitehats, and security experts to stem defi hacks. The idea was launched in August last year after bad actors stole over $70 million from Ethereum-based stablecoin exchange Curve.

Curve Finance was only one of several attacks at the time, as criminals like North Korea’s Lazarus group stole hundreds of millions in crypto from blockchain users. Peckshiled analysts estimated that hackers stole over $2 billion from 600 incidents last year."

The service, called OpsChain Contract Manager, allows clients to place contracts on a public blockchain while ensuring the confidentiality of business information through zero-knowledge circuits. OpsChain is marketed as operating on Ethereum but uses Polygon’s proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain.

According to Paul Brody, who leads EY’s blockchain efforts, the distinction is important as Ernst & Young (EY) plans to eventually transition the underlying technology to Ethereum’s mainnet and further to layer 3 in an upcoming upgrade.

“Nightfall was developed on Ethereum and is deployed to Ethereum’s test network, but so far, EY’s industrial users have been drawn to Polygon for its low transaction costs,” revealed Brody, further explaining how Polygon’s network would be more beneficial compared to Ethereum’s.

Polygon’s lower transaction costs attract EY’s industrial clients. However, Brody, who previously helped develop IBM’s first blockchain initiative, asserts that the future of blockchain for business lies in public blockchains like Ethereum.

The concept of employing blockchain technology for business purposes is not anything new. During the initial phases of Bitcoin and blockchain development, organizations such as the Distributed Ledger Group emerged to explore how businesses could benefit from distributed ledger technology, frequently opting for private blockchains.

Brody criticizes private blockchains for their inability to offer true privacy, noting that all participants can still view all transactions, which could inadvertently reveal sensitive business data.

EY also developed Starlight, a zero-knowledge compiler that uses hashing techniques to enhance privacy for existing smart contracts. This approach allows businesses to manage contracts more securely and transparently, leveraging the infrastructure on public blockchains to reduce deployment costs."

According to a press release, the bill was developed jointly with the Federal Reserve and the New York State Department of Financial Services. Stablecoin issuers must have reserves of cash or cash equivalents at a 1:1 ratio to back their tokens.

In addition, the bill introduces a ban on unbacked algorithmic stablecoins. The bill’s authors argue that neither the issuer nor the users can use stablecoins for illegal or unauthorized purposes, such as money laundering.

“To meet the growing demand for our ever-evolving financial industry, we need to craft legislation that strikes the careful balance of establishing a clear and workable framework for stablecoins while protecting consumers.” Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.)

The explanatory note states that the bill aims to create a framework that encourages “responsible” innovation. The piece of legislation envisions using stablecoins for faster cross-border transactions, lower fees, and unlocking the potential of the digital asset industry.

The preparation of an alternative bill on stablecoins became known in early April 2024. It became a response to the bill presented in the spring of 2023. The latter provides for the subordination of issuing companies to the Fed and a temporary ban on algorithmic stablecoins.

Gillibrand called her bill a reasonable compromise since it puts oversight responsibilities in the hands of state regulators. After publication, the head of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown, stated that he was ready to vote for the bill’s passage under certain conditions."

Announced on April 16, the budget plans to enforce the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), a system approved by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in August 2022.

The move came in response to the G20’s mandate in 2021, which required the OECD to develop a framework supporting the automatic exchange of tax information involving crypto assets.

Cryptoasset service providers, including exchanges, brokers, dealers, and ATM operators, will have to comply with the new reporting requirements and disclose complete transaction details to the government every year.

The reporting criteria require service providers to report transactions between different cryptocurrencies, between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, and transfers of cryptocurrencies. However, transactions initiated using central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are exempt from these requirements.

On top of these, cryptocurrency service providers will also be reporting client-specific information such as full names, residential addresses, dates of birth, jurisdictions of residence, and taxpayer identification numbers. Further, these requirements will apply to both Canadian residents and non-residents.

As the implementation of the CARF will require significant funding, the budget suggested allocating CA$51.6 million ($37.3 million) to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) over five years starting from 2024-25. Further, an annual budget of CA$7.3 million ($5.2 million) has been allocated to sustain the ongoing administration and operational costs.

The Canadian government plans to implement these mandates in 2026. The initial exchange of information from service providers is slated for 2027.

The budget also introduced provisions that aim to mitigate crypto tax evasion in the nation. These include penalties for taxpayers who fail to meet the disclosure requirements.

“Just as crypto-assets pose financial risks to middle class Canadians, the rapid growth of crypto-asset markets poses significant risks of tax evasion. Regulation and the international exchange of tax information must keep pace with tax evasion threats in order to ensure a fair tax system,” an excerpt from the budget reads.

Regulators in Canada have recently shifted their attention towards the growing crypto economy in the nation. Earlier in Jan. 2024, the nation’s securities regulators proposed new rules for public investment funds dealing with crypto assets. Under the new regulations, only alternative investment funds and non-redeemable investment funds would be allowed to trade or have crypto assets in custody directly.

In a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, Durov suggested there will be new hardware communication devices created, as the matter of online privacy becomes more evident. Commenting on the matter, the Telegram CEO noted that the crypto market has already solved that problem, referring to hardware crypto wallets.

“I’m an optimist. I think some new secure hardware communication devices will be created in a similar way that now we have hardware wallets to store your cryptocurrency. Maybe we’ll have secure communication devices to send messages or do voice calls.” Pavel Durov

Speaking on other crypto-related ventures, Durov mentioned Telegram’s brainchild The Open Network, which faced opposition from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2019.

“To be completely fair, Telegram did take outside money, we issued bonds three years ago… and before that, we had a a cryptocurrency project that also raised funds. There were instances where we raised outside funding. But when it comes to the company’s equity, we didn’t give anyone ownership or voting control or anything like that.” Pavel Durov

In October 2019, the SEC issued a restraining order against Telegram, preventing the company from launching its planned token dubbed Gram. The SEC alleged that the company’s initial coin offering (ICO) violated securities laws by offering unregistered securities to investors.

In early 2018, Telegram raised approximately $1.7 billion through the sale of its Gram tokens to private investors. However, the SEC alleged that the company had failed to register to sell 2.9 billion digital tokens to initial investors worldwide, including $1 billion to U.S. buyers.

Despite the ban, Telegram’s blockchain venture survived, initially driven by blockchain enthusiasts who supported its principles. Later, however, Telegram’s ties to the TON ecosystem deepened, with the addition of Toncoin, the project’s native cryptocurrency, as a payment method in its advertising revenue-sharing system for channel owners.

According to a report from local media VG, the new framework will mandate that data centers register officially and provide information about those involved, like owners and leaders, and the type of services they offer. The legislation will be the first of its kind, making Norway the first European nation to regulate the data center industry.

“The purpose is to regulate the industry in such a way that we can close the door on the projects we do not want,” said Digitalization Minister Karianne Tung.

The new legislation is designed to enhance local government officials’ oversight of data centers, enabling them to make more informed decisions about approving or rejecting their operations. Regulators believe that this law will significantly improve the management of local data infrastructure.

Further, the regulators also clarified that they aren’t in favor of crypto-mining operations. Minister for Energy Terje Aasland expressed concerns regarding the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the cryptocurrency mining process.

“It is associated with large greenhouse-gas emissions and is an example of a type of business we do not want in Norway,” Aasland said, adding that they are not interested in businesses that are looking to extract cheap electricity.

Norway is Europe’s largest hydropower producer, with renewable energy sources accounting for the majority of the country’s electricity. As such, the nation has become a budding hub for cryptocurrency miners in recent years due to the low electricity costs in the region. Per a 2023 report, mining firms in Northern Norway, where electricity is the cheapest, cumulatively used as much electricity as the district of Lofoten.

At the moment, the number of Bitcoin mining firms operating within the nation is unknown to the regulators. However, the new law will offer more clarity on the matter and help carry out Norway’s border digitalization plans, according to Tung.

The increased scrutiny from Norway comes as the broader crypto-mining economy has seen dwindling performance. Stocks of some major Bitcoin mining firms, like Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms, have continued to drop over the past few weeks.

The developments come as the crypto industry is set to witness the fourth Bitcoin halving this week. According to 10x Research Head Markus Thielen, Bitcoin miners could liquidate $5 billion worth of the flagship asset to remain profitable post-halving."

Like regular stablecoins, USDP is designed to maintain a stable value equivalent to a U.S. dollar, providing a safe haven for traders against the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. However, the recent unexpected increase in price, spotlighted by PeckShield, has raised concerns.

The stablecoin uncharacteristically spiked to $1.2848 yesterday at 16:10 UTC before eventually witnessing a subsequent drop to its usual price of $1 four hours later. While the depeg went unnoticed by most, it had far-reaching effects on a trader’s loan position, triggering liquidations.

The liquidation occurred on the decentralized finance (defi) platform Aave, where the trader had used USDP as collateral to secure a loan in USDC. Notably, in the defi ecosystem, loans are backed by other assets, with mechanisms in place to manage sudden shifts in market dynamics.

On-chain data confirms that the trader lost the 529,000 USDC across sixteen uneven transactions from 16:16 to 20:09 UTC, coinciding with the period USDP lost its peg. The transaction label indicates that the liquidation process was automatically initiated by Aave’s built-in risk management algorithms.

While the USDP value spiked, the platform likely predicted a possible correction or a return to its normal pegged rate. Such a forecast can prompt preemptive liquidation to mitigate potential losses, especially if the borrower’s loan-to-value (LTV) ratio becomes unfavorable.

Issued by Paxos, USDP has faced certain setbacks in recent times, marked by occasional depegs. A 2023 research from SP Global suggested that USDP records the highest deviations from the U.S. dollar among the top stablecoins, having witnessed 7,581 mild depeg events in the 24 months leading to June 2023."

The compromised account also attached a link to a sham website, urging users to get early access to the fraudulent SPIDER cryptocurrency as well as Spiderverse NFTs.

With all signs pointing towards a potential hack, some early-captured screenshots also showed a mysterious man’s selfie emerging on the actor’s X profile subsequently.

The now-deleted post displayed an inverted face reveal of the presumed hacker in a mask, which was pulled down to his chin. The curly-haired individual, potentially the hacker himself, captioned the post, “would u kiss me while i hang from my web xxx,” referencing the iconic upside-down kiss from the original Tobey Maguire-led Spider-Man flick.

The post, which was initially pinned on his profile, has already been taken down.

This hack’s timing also crazily coincides with Sam Raimi’s 2002 directorial’s return to select movie theatres on April 15.

As always, fans took this chance to meme the situation as tweets stating, “How do you hack Tom Holland’s Twitter account and make the stupidest tweets ever instead of having ur chance to fake tease Spider-Man 4 and go crazy?” surfaced online.

On the flip side, others were just relieved to find out they hadn’t lost their much-loved web-slinger to the crypto scheme. Someone wrote online: “okay nvm tom holland was hacked he is redeemed really thought we lost another man to disappointment!”

While Holland’s “Spiderverse” post is certainly fake, Marvel has already dipped its toes into web3.

In late 2021, American movie theater giant AMC joined forces with Sony Pictures to offer thousands of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to some people who purchased tickets for Holland’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home” in advance. The movie managed to gross more than $1.9 billion, becoming a major hit. The NFT gimmick contributed to the second-biggest one-day ticket sales of all time for AMC.

Prior to that, New Zealand-based NFT company VeVe also teamed up with Marvel to offer Spider-Man NFTs. One of the NFTs included the very first Marvel book that was released all the way back in 1939.

Earlier this year, Ethereum-powered digital collectibles platform VeVe also released NFT comics with such Marvel heroes as Spider-Man, X-Men, and so on."

Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT uncovered an alleged attacker behind the PrismaFi hack, which left the protocol without $11.1 million worth of crypto. In a series of X posts, ZachXBT revealed that the exploiter, known as 0x77 (or Trung) might be linked to multiple other exploits.

The Prisma team detected a series of transactions on the MigrateTroveZap contract earlier in March, which eventually resulted in a loss of 3,257 ETH (equivalent to $11.1 million at the time). Initially, the attacker communicated with the Prisma deployer, claiming the attack was just a whitehat initiative. However, all the funds were later deposited to Tornado Cash, a sanctioned crypto mixer.

The exploiter proceeded to make audacious demands, including a $3.8 million (34%) whitehat bounty, significantly higher than the industry standard of 10%, ZachXBT noted, adding that the demand was “essentially extorting the team as the treasury does not have sufficient assets to reimburse users.”

Further investigation revealed that the exploiter’s address received funds via FixedFloat and was subsequently located on Arbitrum, a layer-2 solution on Ethereum. By analyzing timing, ZachXBT found that the exploiter’s address was connected to withdrawals on TRON, including those from the Bybit crypto exchange.

The investigation also uncovered connections to previous exploits, such as the Arcade_xyz exploit from March 2023 and the Pine Protocol exploit from February this year. The exploiter, using the alias 0x77 on Telegram, remained active, with ties to the deployer of @modulusprotocol, further solidifying the link between each incident.

The investigator also disclosed conducting an analysis of the exploiter’s personal information, gathering phone numbers and emails, which suggested a proficient technical background. Currently, all gathered personal data has been forwarded to the Prisma team, who are pursuing legal action against the hacker in Vietnam and Australia, ZachXBT added."

On April 17, EY announced the launch of the EY OpsChain Contract Manager (OCM), a blockchain-enabled solution designed to overcome barriers like managing multiple business agreements across internal and external operational and technology silos.

The blockchain solution also allows multiple parties to synchronize data among business partners. It also uses smart contracts to enforce key agreements such as standardized pricing, volume discounts, rebates, and strike prices.

The Big Four firm cited statistics from Zion Market Research, which projects that the global smart contracts market will reach $1 billion by 2030. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is expected to be around 24% between 2023 and 2030.

EY OCM, which debuted at the annual EY Global Blockchain Summit, runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures that it operates in a decentralized manner within a stable environment.

“Deploying on a public blockchain is not only cheaper, but also much more scalable, helping enable many-to-many integrations on an open platform with no one company having an unfair advantage by controlling the network.” Paul Brody, EY global blockchain leader

EY OCM uses an API to manage smart contract providers. This allows firms to create personalized user interfaces and enable the configuration of standard pre-built contracting models. The initial set of pre-built models includes Power Purchase Agreements for renewables.

Furthermore, EY stated that the solution can automatically validate contract terms using real-time checks. It also analyzes policy compliance and instantly alerts users to any inconsistencies. As a result, transactions that do not comply with the contract requirements are blocked from proceeding.

This helps to avoid a strategic advantage for either a buyer or a seller. Additionally, it helps to reduce the high costs associated with launching and managing a private network. It also tackles the concerns of exchanging sensitive company information through a consolidated industry portal.

The latest development marks another instance of EY’s involvement with the blockchain sector. In October 2023, EY announced the rollout of the fourth generation of its EY blockchain analytics tool.

At that time, EY said that the Reconciler tool would assist Fidelity in improving its internal risk management for digital assets.

In September 2021, EY said it would use Polygon with EY’s flagship blockchain services, including EY OpsChain and EY Blockchain Analyzer."

Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the average fees on the Ethereum network plunged by 70.6% since April 13’s local high of $6.93 — currently sitting at $2.03, marking its 11-week low.

The declining fees show that the network activity on Ethereum has also dropped significantly as the market weathers mixed sentiment.

Moreover, the ETH total open interest (OI) has recorded its third daily consecutive decline. Per Santiment, the asset’s total OI fell from $5.02 billion on April 14 to $4.83 billion at the reporting time.

The downward momentum of the ETH OI could potentially mean lower volatility for the token since a smaller volume of liquidations would be expected.

On the other hand, the ETH Relative Strength Index (RSI) rose from 38 to 43 over the past 24 hours, according to Santiment.

The indicator shows that the ETH price is still in good condition while slowly moving toward the overvalued zone. For ETH to remain in the bullish zone, its RSI would need to stay below the 50 mark."

The emergence of the EigenLayer and LRT staking protocols increased ETH’s share of staking to 26% of the total supply. Analysts also recorded an increase in the overall growth in coins staked to 31.4 million Ethereum (ETH) as of April 13.

Even though more ETH reduces non-validator rewards, the total amount of rewards paid could still contribute to inflation if there are a significant number of locked assets, Glassnode suggests.

After The Merge, the share of new coins in the total Ethereum supply reached 1.01%. During this period, about 3.55% of ETH was withdrawn from circulation.

As a result of the metric increase, the remuneration level for ensuring network security per each validator dropped to 3.2% per annum.

In addition, innovations like MEV, liquid staking, restaking, and liquid restaking have led to increased staking needs beyond the original intent, according to experts. Liquid restaking protocols account for 27% of the coins sent to the deposit contract.

As more ETH is staked, the effects of inflation begin to affect fewer and fewer holders of the asset. In other words, there is a transfer of wealth to participants who generate additional income from maintaining the network’s security.

Experts pointed out that over time, the real yield component could make ownership of ETH less attractive and negate Ethereum’s function as a monetary asset in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Restaking allows users to stake their assets multiple times on the main blockchain and additional protocols. Since the beginning of the year, the restaking sector has been actively growing.

At the beginning of April, the total value locked (TVL) in the restaking protocols exceeded $8 billion. The leader was the ether.fi project with $3.2 billion."

The transition to Runes is scheduled for later this month, coinciding with the Bitcoin halving event and the launch of the new Runes protocol.

Negative price movement comes as the PUPS token skyrocketed by 1,056% last week in anticipation of these events. Despite claims by its supporters and the official Pups website branding it as the first meme coin on Bitcoin (BTC), there has been some controversy, with others pointing to earlier projects like MEME as pioneers.

As described by Xverse Wallet in its recent guide, Runes are designed as a fungible token alternative to the BRC-20 standard. Runes aims to minimize network congestion by discouraging the accumulation of unnecessary UTXOs. The initiative is gaining traction, with platforms like Magic Eden and BitX facilitating the trading and launching of Rune-related tokens.

Runes protocol, praised for its minimal on-chain footprint, is set to enhance Bitcoin’s functionality by integrating its UTXO model directly into Bitcoin layer 1, contrasting sharply with the more congestive BRC-20 tokens derived from Ordinal Theory."

She argued that such digital currencies could enable unprecedented access to individual financial transactions, thereby increasing the potential for governmental control over personal freedoms.

In contrast, Blackburn praised cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) for their decentralized nature and role in promoting financial autonomy.

“One of the things that we look at is the freedom aspect, the privacy aspect of Bitcoin. That’s a very good thing,” she said.

The senator’s comments stem from many governments exploring or implementing digital currencies. Proponents argue that CBDCs can make financial systems more efficient and inclusive. However, critics like Blackburn warn that they could also increase government surveillance and threaten individual liberties.

Back in February, former President Donald Trump, historically critical of cryptocurrencies, showcased a notable shift, endorsing Bitcoin’s rising popularity, particularly among youth and African American communities. On Fox News’s The Ingraham Angle, Trump acknowledged Bitcoin’s momentum, suggesting it might necessitate some regulatory oversight.

Sharing his insights in an April 16 investor note, Thielen wrote that the cryptocurrency market is moving towards a “crucial tipping point,” which could lead to a notable correction in prices. The analyst revealed that his firm has sold all tech stocks in anticipation of this bearish event.

“We sold everything last night,” wrote Thielen.

The founder cited decreasing rate cuts, rising bond yields, and persistent inflation as the deterrents behind his bearish outlook.



The analysis follows Bitcoin’s 11% drop over the past week. The flagship cryptocurrency is down 6.7% in just the past 24 hours. At the time of publication, it was trading at $61,988.93. Thielen attributed Bitcoin’s drop to waning expectations of a cut in U.S. interest rates.

“Most of this 2023/2024 bitcoin rally is driven by expectations that interest rates would be cut, and this narrative is being seriously challenged now,” he added.

Despite Upbit‘s longstanding dominance in the South Korean crypto scene, boasting an average market share of 82% over the past three years, the recent changes in the landscape appear to have brought more competition to the market, with Bithumb and Korbit launching zero-fee campaigns toward the end of 2023.

Although Korbit’s market share has seen minimal growth, hovering around 1% in 2024, Bithumb experienced a significant surge, tripling its market share in the months following the implementation of its zero-fee policy in October 2023, analysts at Kaiko say. Despite the success of the zero-fee strategy in driving trade volume, the analysts noted that Bithumb faced a substantial revenue decline of 60% in 2023, prompting the exchange to discontinue the initiative.

“The significant decline in revenue may have prompted the exchange to discontinue its zero-fee campaign on Feb. 5, just five months after its launch.” Kaiko

Although there has been a slight decrease in KRW volumes in early April, Kaiko says market sentiment across the Asia-Pacific region could receive a boost given the recent approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong.

According to an April 15 indictment from the United States Attorney’s office in Brooklyn, Charles O. Parks III, also known as “CP3O,” has been charged with defrauding two prominent cloud service providers.

Cryptojacking is a cyberattack in which attackers illegally “hijack” the victim’s system and mine cryptocurrency using its resources, such as processing power or electricity. The attack is executed in various forms and, in most cases, is undetected by the victim’s system until it is too late.

Parks allegedly stole $3.5 worth of computational resources offered by the service providers. The resources were then utilized to mine $970,000 worth of cryptocurrencies. The complete list of charges includes “wire fraud, money laundering, and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions in connection with the scheme.”

The accused was apprehended on April 13, 2024, and the case is being led by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Park is set to appear before the federal court in Omaha on April 16.

“Criminals are becoming more adept at manipulating digital tools and hiding behind advanced technology, which often causes significant financial damage to their victims. The FBI is committed to the steadfast pursuit of those who attempt to develop innovative techniques to commit crimes,” said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Smith.

Park’s scheme was active from January 2021 to August 2021. During that period, he set up multiple accounts with the cloud service providers (plaintiffs) using various business names he created, such as “MultiMillionaire LLC” and “CP3O LLC.” He then used these accounts to access significant amounts of computer processing power and storage space, which he never paid for.

Further, Park managed to trick the plaintiffs into offering him elevated access to their services. Using the resources, he mined multiple cryptocurrencies, including Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Monero (XMR). He was also accused of deflecting inquiries about questionable data usage and deferring bills.

Prosecutors added that Park laundered the funds via multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, an NFT marketplace, and traditional bank accounts. The transactions were also structured in a way that avoids exceeding the federal reporting threshold of $10,000.

He used the illicit funds for personal gains, including buying a “Mercedes Benz luxury car, jewelry and first-class hotel and travel expenses.” If found guilty, he is expected to face a maximum of 20 years in prison for wire fraud and 10 years for illegal transaction charges.

Another notable case of cryptojacking in 2024 is that of a 29-year-old who illicitly mined cryptocurrencies via one million virtual servers. The accused was arrested in Jan. 2024 by the National Police of Ukraine, claiming that over $2 million in cryptocurrencies was mined."

As earlier reported by crypto.news, Hong Kong approved several Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs on Monday. While the Bitcoin community viewed this as a very positive development, Balchunas was quick to dismiss these products as having little significance.

“Don’t expect a lot of flows (I saw one estimate of $25b that’s insane). We think they’ll be lucky to get $500m,” he said.

He cited the modest size of the local ETF market, the lack of well-known issuers, relatively low liquidity, and expensive fees as the primary reasons why these products are unlikely to draw considerable inflows.

Meanwhile, a significant outflow of Bitcoin from miners could be expected in the months following the upcoming halving.

In a recent report, Markus Thielen, the head of research at 10x Research, estimated that Bitcoin miners might liquidate around $5 billion in BTC following the halving.

Thielen also stated that the selling pressure from miners might last for four to six months, resulting in a potential sideways fluctuation in Bitcoin’s price during that time, similar to what has occurred in previous halving cycles."

However, following the $66,867 high yesterday, BTC witnessed a subsequent collapse, dropping to the higher spectrum of the $61,000 threshold before staging a recovery from this floor. Despite the push above this level, Bitcoin witnessed a 4% decline in the past 24 hours, trading at $63,250 at the time of writing.

Consequently, the crypto market has lost over $79 billion in valuation over the past day, with the global crypto market cap currently sitting at $2.243 trillion. One of the primary factors responsible for this sudden pullback is a surge in selloffs, as market participants rushed to exit the market at breakeven upon the rebound.

In addition, Coinglass data confirms that Bitcoin derivatives volume has increased by 10.31% in the last 24 hours to $98.1 billion as of press time, with the long/short ratio sitting at 0.9573. This figure indicates a confluence of increased derivatives trades and a predominant bearish sentiment.

The prevailing bearish pressure has persisted despite the upcoming halving event, expected to bolster Bitcoin’s price action by reducing the daily inflation rate. Interestingly, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek warned that this downturn would persist before the halving, slated for the next three days.

Exchanges have also witnessed increased Bitcoin inflows, signaling a rise in selling pressure. Moreover, the tension around the looming Iran-Israel conflict has not fully subsided, with reports suggesting that Israel plans to retaliate to the attack from Iran.

At its current price point, Bitcoin needs to break above the 50-day EMA at $64,735 to record a shift in short-term sentiments from bearish to bullish. However, the asset would face stern resistance at $64,200, aligning with Fibonacci 0.236."

As crypto.news noted earlier, various crypto industry figures hold differing views on the halving’s effects. Tezos co-founder Arthur Breitman views it as a “reduction in security budget,” suggesting potential benefits in addressing overpayment for security. However, Arthur Hayes, former head of BitMEX, anticipates BTC price declines due to limited dollar liquidity during the period. Marathon CEO Fred Thiel suggests that the halving’s impact may already be priced in, citing successful spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals."

The role was part of an agreement with both the Justice Department and the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

According to a guide from Xverse Wallet, Runes are fungible tokens issued on Bitcoin (BTC) using the Runes protocol. Casey Rodarmor introduced Runes last year as a streamlined alternative to the BRC-20 standard.

The protocol aims to avoid network congestion by preventing junk UTXOs. Supported robustly by the community, the first Rune token, RUNE, was issued immediately after the announcement, with further developments, including a significant grant and a new issuance tool.

As the halving approaches, the anticipation surrounding the Runes ecosystem intensifies.

The guide states, “Bitcoin builders are already gearing up for the launch by building the supporting infrastructure for Runes tokens,” highlighting the growing interest and development within the sector.

Runes marketplaces and launchpads, such as Magic Eden and BitX, allow users to trade and launch various Rune-related tokens. Platforms like Fluid Tokens are also developing decentralized applications for lending runes, underscoring the ecosystem’s expanding functionality and utility.

“Runes has a minimal on-chain footprint and improves overall efficiency,” the guide explained, contrasting the BRC-20 tokens derived from Ordinal Theory, not native to Bitcoin, which increase network congestion due to UTXO proliferation.

Integrating Bitcoin’s UTXO model, the Runes protocol operates on Bitcoin Layer 1, enhancing base blockchain interaction without excessive UTXO production. Unlike BRC-20, Runes also penalizes errors by burning tokens, ensuring careful UTXO management.

Many Ordinal and BRC-20 projects allow investors and holders to accumulate Runes by a runic miner, giving them the power to invest in this new technology before its launch. Runestone, a BRC-20 project, airdropped 100,000 tokens to the Ordinals community which currently sits at 0.078 BTC floor, the equivalent of $5,100, and will allow its holders to accumulate Runes."

Historically, halvings have been catalysts for bullish cycles. However, this year, external factors such as growing institutional demand and Bitcoin hitting an all-time high before halving for the first time have led many to believe that the current market cycle is different.

Patel discussed this evolving nature of market cycles, noting that “we are currently in Bitcoin’s fifth market cycle.” Highlighting historical trends in Bitcoin’s market behavior, he observed that each cycle typically extends beyond the duration of its predecessor. Based on this trend, he anticipates that the ongoing cycle will further propel Bitcoin prices upward as the extended market activity aligns with enhanced price trajectories over time.

“There’s a strong likelihood that the bull market will persist after the halving, possibly pushing Bitcoin’s price to $100,000 by year-end,” Patel added.

2024 is the year of Bitcoin ETFs, with the U.S. approving multiple spot ETF products for Bitcoin. This approval has been touted as a key propellent for Bitcoin’s recent surge. According to Patel, these instruments make Bitcoin investment more accessible and thereby expand the investor base.

The Indian market’s response to the Bitcoin halving is also projected to mirror the global trend but with local nuances. The reduction in supply and the prospect of increased scarcity are expected to enhance Bitcoin’s appeal to Indian investors, potentially catalyzing further adoption.

“Historically, Bitcoin halving events have been associated with bullish sentiment and upward price movements globally, driven by the anticipation of reduced supply and increased scarcity. This could translate to a similar trend in the Indian crypto market, with investors viewing the halving as a bullish signal and increasing their exposure to Bitcoin,” Patel added.

Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX, voiced similar opinions regarding the role of Bitcoin ETFs when it comes to boosting adoption.

“The long-awaited arrival of Bitcoin ETFs has garnered immense attention, particularly from institutional investors in the US. Their entry, considered a major endorsement, has propelled the industry forward by providing a level of legitimacy many investors have been waiting for. This, in turn, could encourage further investment and broader market participation,” Gupta told crypto.news.

He predicted that these financial instruments would catalyze a substantial increase in market activity within India, leading to heightened “transactions and volumes” as the sector continues to evolve.

This surge, propelled by the optimism around the halving, will be backed by the “availability of reliable exchanges in the Indian market and widespread knowledge dissemination,” Zepay CEO Rahul Pagidipati told crypto.news.



Pagidipati remained optimistic about the growth of the retail sector in the cryptocurrency market following the halving. He attributes this potential increase to anticipated reforms in the taxation framework, which is currently touted as a “deterrent” to wider adoption in India

“The Indian retail market has shown incredible resilience despite the high capital gains tax on Crypto, and it continues to grow. While we hope to see capital gains tax and tds reduced on Crypto, we anticipate an increase in participation from the retail market because of the Bitcoin halving event.”"

The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) has issued a public warning, cautioning users from investing in crypto-related campaigns promoted in the region. In a press release on Apr. 15, the central bank emphasized, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are “not recognized as legal tender in Fiji” and can’t be used for payments of goods and services, in accordance with local rules.

Reserve Bank of Fiji Governor Ariff Ali also addressed the increasing promotion of crypto investment schemes in the region, highlighting that the RBF “has not licenced nor authorised any person or entity to offer cryptocurrency investments or trade in virtual assets in Fiji.”

“Therefore, the public is strongly advised to refrain from participating in cryptocurrency investment or trading schemes currently being promoted in Fiji.” Ariff Ali

The central bank of Fiji also reiterated that it is illegal for individuals or entities to purchase or invest in crypto using funds held in Fiji, emphasizing that such activities “may be subject to penalties.”

The RBF’s stance on crypto investments has evolved over time. In July 2023, reports surfaced indicating that the central bank was considering the use of digital currency in Fiji. However, no concrete decisions regarding crypto legalization have been made since then.

Additionally, in late December 2023, crypto.news reported on collaboration between the Reserve Bank of Fiji and the National Bank of Cambodia to improve the cross-border payment network using central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

In an interview with CNBC at the Chainalysis Links event in New York, IRS stagger Guy Ficco noted that there will be an uptick in “Title 26 crypto cases” in 2024. Ficco’s comments came days before April 15, the deadline for filing crypto taxes in the nation.

Title 26 of the United States Code includes specific provisions aimed at addressing tax evasion. Tax evasion typically involves the deliberate underpayment or non-payment of taxes due through illegal means, such as underreporting income, inflating deductions, or hiding money and income offshore.

The IRS exec said that cryptocurrencies had previously been used mostly as tools for various financial crimes, such as fraud, scams, and money laundering. He added that the IRS had recently observed a surge in “pure crypto tax crimes,” noting that such activities are expected to rise further into the year.

“This could be purely not reporting income generated from crypto sales, it could be hiding the true basis of crypto and that’s an area I anticipate an increase in,” Ficco remarked.

According to Ficco, the IRS has partnered with Chainalysis and other law enforcement agencies to enhance its efforts against crypto crimes. He went on to state that while IRS agents are “phenomenal” at following money, the cryptocurrency sector requires the use of special tools.

“That’s where the experts at Chainalysis come in,” he added.

Ficco added that the IRS has grown more hostile when investigating cases involving U.S. residents who have failed to report their crypto taxes or have lied on their crypto tax returns in the past.

The comments from Ficco follow a February 7 indictment from a federal grand jury in a similar case. Frank Richard Ahlgren III, a Texas citizen, was charged with filing false tax returns on over $4 million worth of his Bitcoin gains.

Concerns over cryptocurrency taxes aren’t limited to the United States alone. Regulators all across the globe have been actively working to refine taxation efforts for digital currencies. The latest development came from Japan’s ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party, which has recently urged the government to carry out “immediate” crypto tax reforms.

Meanwhile, per an earlier Crypto.news report, South Korea’s Gyeonggi province adopted a new system to combat crypto tax evasion in Feb. 2024. The regulators were able to recover $4.6 million in unpaid taxes from defaulters."
https://crypto.news/bitcoin-miners-could-liquidate-5b-in-btc-post-halving/,Bitcoin miners could liquidate $5b in BTC post-halving,2024-04-15 10:09:54+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","Market analysts predict that miners might sell off around $5 billion worth of Bitcoin in the months after the upcoming halving, a trend seen in past cycles.

According to estimations by Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, in an April 13 analyst note, bitcoin miners might liquidate $5 billion in BTC following the halving.

“The overhang from this selling could last four to six months, explaining why Bitcoin might go sideways for the next few months — as it has done following past halvings,” he said in a statement.

Thielen believes that this might happen again, with crypto markets facing “a significant challenge in a six-month’summer’ lull.”

Bitcoin prices remained in the range bound between $9,000 and $11,500 for the five months following the 2020 halving.

This year, the halving will take place around April 20, only six days away, therefore markets may not experience a big upward trend until around October, if history repeats.

Furthermore, miners prefer to stockpile BTC, “leading to a supply/demand imbalance and a subsequent rally in Bitcoin prices,” leading up to the halving, he stated.

This has already happened, with Bitcoin values rising 74% in 2024 to a record high of $73,734 on March 14 before falling below $63,000 in mid-April.

Thielen also pointed out the disproportionate impact on altcoins, which have significantly receded from their peak values in 2021. Despite speculation about a post-halving altcoin rally, Thielen referenced historical evidence suggesting such a rally would typically start around six months later.

Focusing on specific mining operations, Thielen mentioned that Marathon, the world’s largest Bitcoin miner, has accumulated an inventory likely to be gradually sold post-halving to avoid a sharp drop in revenue. Marathon currently mines approximately 28–30 BTC per day, and post-halving, this could add up to 133 days of additional supply to the market, with an ongoing production of 14–15 BTC per day.

Thielen concluded that if all miners adopt a similar strategy, the market could see up to $104 million worth of Bitcoin being sold each day post-halving, potentially reversing the supply-demand imbalance that has driven the recent price rally.

Around April 20, the halving will cut the amount of Bitcoin that “miners” can earn each day for validating transactions to 450 from 900 now. Bitcoin’s current price could spell revenue losses of around US$10 billion a year for the industry as a whole.

Marathon Digital Holdings, CleanSpark, and other miners, which compete for a fixed Bitcoin payout by solving mathematical puzzles using superfast computers, have invested in new equipment and sought to acquire smaller competitors in an effort to offset revenue declines.

“This is the final push for miners to squeeze out as much revenue as they can before their production takes a big hit,” said Matthew Kimmell, a digital asset analyst at CoinShares.

“With revenues across the board decreasing overnight, the strategic response of each miner, and how they adapt, could well determine who comes out ahead and who gets left behind.”

Last week, Marathon CEO Peter Thiel stated that the company’s break-even rate for being profitable after the halving would be around $46,000 per BTC, expecting that there would be no substantial price changes in the six months following the event.

“Traditionally, a larger bullish cycle has always followed the Bitcoin halving. Although we might see some volatility in the short term after the halving, it will likely translate into a prolonged bull market for Bitcoin,” Alvin Kan, COO at Bitget Wallet, told Crypto.news.

Kan said that ETFs will continue to be a major factor in the market’s dynamics. Since the SEC’s approval in January, spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded a total cumulative net inflow of $56.27 billion, marking the fastest growth in the history of the ETF market. The rapid influx has contributed to Bitcoin reaching its all-time high so early in the bull market.

“So, I think the ETF flow will remain largely positive after the halving. It might even increase, given that investors are aware of the positive impact that halving tends to have on Bitcoin’s price, and they will want to benefit from it,” he added."

Decentralized finance protocol on the Base network, Grand Base, is suspected of conducting a rug pull after the crypto community noticed a multi-million mint via the deployer’s address. As noted by a user @0xkinnif, Grand Base’s deployer minted on Apr. 15 an additional 22.5 million GB tokens (worth around $47 million), sending the token’s value plummeting by nearly 100% to $0.0049.

In response to the incident, a spokesperson for the project addressed concerns in a Telegram channel, attributing the minting to an exploit of the project’s deployer wallet. The spokesperson reassured users that the team is actively collaborating with the MEXC crypto exchange to halt trading activities associated with the exploited tokens.

Launched in early 2024, Grand Base aimed to provide a decentralized marketplace for spot synthetic real-world assets (RWAs), offering exposure to RWAs without the need to hold the underlying assets. The project gained significant traction, with its GB token generating millions of dollars in daily trading volumes, according to data from CoinGecko.

However, despite its initial success, the project also faced scrutiny due to a feature in its smart contract that allowed developers to mint new tokens without any limitations, as highlighted by CoinGecko on GB’s price page.

Solana experienced significant losses during the recent market-wide downturn, which also saw Bitcoin (BTC) fall to $61,514. Alongside the broader market, SOL plummeted to a six-week low of $116 on April 13, marking a three-day losing streak.

SOL price – April 15 | Source: Trading View

Despite rebounding from the $116 support level, Solana saw a decline of over 21% from April 11 to 13, marking one of its most significant three-day losses this year.

However, following this steep downturn, the cryptocurrency embarked on a recovery effort, capitalizing on Bitcoin’s rebound to regain the support levels it had lost.

Solana has maintained its upward trajectory, aiming to recover and hold the Fibonacci 0.5 level at $159.91. Surpassing this mark and reclaiming $170.35 could strengthen SOL’s position to target the April 5 peak of $185.21, which aligns with Fib. 0.786.

Currently trading at $154.60, the altcoin is poised to encounter a significant challenge at the 50-day EMA of $160.67. A breakthrough above this indicator would signal a shift in short-term momentum from bearish to bullish.

Solana looks to resolve congestion issues

As Solana continues its recovery journey, efforts are underway to resolve its unique congestion challenges. The surge in meme coin trading and increased adoption have led to heightened network activity, resulting in congestion and sporadic transaction failures.

Last week, Anza, a cohort of Solana developers, rolled out a network upgrade, version 1.18.11, on the devnet, urging validators to evaluate its reliability on the testnet. This marked one of the initial steps taken to tackle the congestion issues.

Most recently, Anza announced the deployment of version 1.17.31 on the mainnet, highlighting its availability for public use. They affirmed that the update includes improvements designed to tackle the existing congestion issues until the official release of version 1.18 on the mainnet.

.@Solana MainnetBeta validators: the v1.17.31 release is now recommended for general use. This patch contains enhancements which will help alleviate some of the ongoing network congestion, and will be followed by further enhancements in v1.18.



Please upgrade when there's less… — Anza (@anza_xyz) April 15, 2024

It’s worth noting that despite the ongoing congestion challenges, Solana has effectively mitigated any significant downtime. The network experienced its only major outage of the year on Feb. 6, lasting for over four hours."

While the initial focus is on institutional and corporate clients, the possibility of extending the offering to retail clients remains unclear.

The latest uptick in investment comes after a challenging year for the sector and just as the market anticipates the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in mid-April 2024.

The report, which surveyed approximately 2,400 private crypto investors across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, sheds light on changing investment behaviors and attitudes in the DACH region. The study indicates a surge in crypto investments, with 54% of respondents dedicating over 20% of their total investments to digital assets.

Notably, a dedicated segment of these investors, who commit more than half of their assets to cryptocurrencies, are prepared to support the industry for the next 3 to 5 years.

The report also points to a shift towards more cautious investment practices. New market entrants are now performing thorough evaluations before committing funds, a move that necessitates crypto service providers to enhance their efforts in converting registered interests into active investments. The gap between registration on platforms and active participation underscores this trend.

Security concerns continue to dominate the criteria for selecting crypto exchanges, with 82% of investors prioritizing this aspect. Deposit and withdrawal options and transaction costs are also key considerations for 65% and 62% of respondents, respectively.



Although 34% of those surveyed view their crypto investments as relatively safe, the majority still express concerns over market manipulation, regulatory changes, and financial crime.

Bitcoin remains the primary choice for investors, held by 91% of respondents, with Ethereum a close second at 78%. Solana has seen an increase in investor interest, rising by 9% compared to last year, reinforcing its position among the top digital assets in the region.

In the broader market context, the recent approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been a boon, attracting substantial capital inflows. Since their introduction, Bitcoin ETFs have amassed $56.2 billion.

However, spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen a net outflow of $55 million on Friday, April 12, with the last week alone seeing a total outflow of $298.4 million.

Analysts suggest these withdrawals could be investors taking profits ahead of the halving, a strategy often followed by a reinvestment after a market dip.

The upcoming Bitcoin halving, which reduces the new supply of Bitcoin, is typically viewed as a precursor to a bull market, heightening expectations of increased demand as the cryptocurrency sector continues to expand.

“With the new supply of Bitcoin decreasing, demand is expected to rise, especially as the crypto industry expands.

The calm before the storm

The crypto market started the week favorably, with the global crypto market cap surging 3.6% to a 3-month high of $2.62 trillion on April 8, with Bitcoin (BTC) reclaiming the $72,000 price threshold following a 3% spike.

BTC approached its all-time high on April 8 after rising 4% to offset the losses of the previous correction. However, the premier crypto asset recorded a price decline the next day, dropping 3.45% to $68,000 on April 9 as U.S. inflation data came out hotter than expected.

This downward spiral was short-lived, as Bitcoin eventually staged a comeback, rallying 2.15% on April 10 to recover the $70,000 territory. This recovery push persisted despite an observable drop in whale activity.

Reports from April 9 confirmed that BitMEX founder Author Hayes remained skeptical of Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim and hold above its recently set all-time high as the halving nears. Hayes predicted that BTC could drop immediately before and after the halving.

Iran-Israel conflict exacerbates market crash

The bears retook control of the scene as the week progressed. Bitcoin dropped to the $65,000 zone on April 12 for the first time in over a week. With the Bitcoin decline came a wider collapse in the market, causing the global crypto valuation to fall to $2.2 trillion on April 12.

The tension surrounding the looming Iran-Israel conflict exacerbated the market drop. This resulted in massive liquidations across the market, with over $860 million flushed from the derivatives market.

Iran eventually fired over 100 drones toward Israel on April 13, further escalating the tension. Following this unprecedented attack, the crypto market saw a steeper decline, with Bitcoin dropping to a 1-month low of $60,660 on April 13.

Despite the liquidations, renowned computer intelligence consultant and Bitcoin advocate Edward Snowden emphasized that there is no reason to panic.

Uniswap receives a Wells Notice

While the crypto community grappled with price volatility, the U.S. SEC explored the prospect of leveling charges against Ethereum-based decentralized exchange Uniswap, the largest DEX in the world.

Notably, Uniswap revealed on April 10 that it had received a Wells Notice from the SEC, with the securities regulator declaring its intentions to pursue legal action against the decentralized exchange.

Uniswap founder Hayden Adams expressed his disappointment in the move, but stressed that he and his team plan to fight. Following reports of the development, UNI, the exchange’s native token, dropped 17% to $9.27 as selloffs intensified.

US regulatory environment

The broader U.S. crypto regulatory environment took center stage this week. Reports surfaced, revealing that the Treasury is seeking greater authority to crack down on crypto use by sanctioned entities like North Korea, Russia and Iran.

U.S. lawmaker Senator Kirsten Gillibrand disclosed this week that Congress is already engaged in discussions about introducing a bipartisan bill to regulate stablecoins. This comes shortly after Ripple revealed intentions to launch a stablecoin this year.

While federal agencies and Congress push to regulate the crypto scene, former Ethereum advisor Steven Nerayoff initiated a lawsuit against the U.S. government, demanding $9.6 billion in damages for alleged harsh treatment by government agencies over the past four years.

Global regulatory efforts

Besides the U.S., regulatory efforts dominated the scene in other jurisdictions. This week, the central bank of Russia called on the country’s lawmakers to quicken the introduction of a bull that would regulate the use of cryptocurrencies, especially for international settlements amid sanctions from the U.S.

Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, reports from this week suggested that crypto exchanges are battling regulatory uncertainty. This prevailing environment is now prompting multiple firms to explore a move overseas.

In British Columbia, the government is looking for ways to address the high energy consumption associated with crypto mining operations. To do this, the region seeks to leverage a legislative amendment to regulate the crypto-mining industry.

Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argued in a letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan on April 8 that it would be more convenient to retain Bankman-Fried in the temporary detention in Brooklyn, where he has been since last August, until an appeal is done.

Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in jail. On April 10, Ryan Salame, a former FTX executive, will receive his sentencing on May 28 after pleading guilty. Other former FTX executives such as Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison also await sentencing.

In a rollercoaster ride, Terra founder Do Kwon’s extradition was again approved by a court in Montenegro. Recently, Andrej Milovic, Montenegro’s Minister of Justice, will determine whether the South Korean developer would be extradited to his home country or the U.S. to face charges.

Lemniscap, a seven-year-old firm that has backed multiple companies in the crypto blockchain space, led the effort. The firm previously led the $2.4-million funding round for web3 startup Safary in January.

Bankless Ventures and Paper Ventures are also backing Aligned Layer, along with StarkWare, O(1)Labs and Ingonyama CEO Omer Shlomovits.

Aligned Layer announced the capital raise via social media. See below.

1. We're excited to announce that we've raised $2.6M in our Seed Round, led by @Lemniscap , to enable developers to access affordable and fast proof verification for all proof systems.

Aligned Layer is touted as the first decentralized ZK Proof verification layer for Ethereum. It’s also powered by Eigen Layer — a restaking mechanism that allows ETH stakers to reallocate their staked ETH and Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to improve security for other protocols.

Aligned Layer goals

The company will put the proceeds of the capital raise toward expanding its operations and accelerating Aligned Layer’s mainnet launch, scheduled for the second quarter of 2024.

As an infrastructure provider, Aligned Layer aims to lower costs and improve speeds for developers that are building applications like L2s, or layer-2 networks.

“Today’s announcement is a testament to our team’s shared dedication to making Ethereum the most cost-effective and efficient platform for ZK verification by using Eigen Layer,” Aligned Layer co-founder Roberto José Catalán said in a prepared statement.

The seed round also included participation from several angel investors, including Sreeram Kannan, Brandon Kase, Daniel Lubarov, DCbuilder, Chainyoda, Weikeng Chen, Sam Benyakoub, Lucas Kozinski and Peter Fittin (SizeChad). See below.

“At Aligned Layer, we firmly believe that developers should be able to use the proof system that best suits their needs, without being constrained by the settlement layer,” Catalán added.

The funds are expected to give the company enough runway to execute near-term goals.

The Aligned Layer funding comes on the heels of a busy week for crypto venture capitalists. New York-based Monad Labs, for example, scored $225 million in funding as part of a round led by Paradigm. Monad is a layer-1 blockchain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine but can process transactions using the same set of rules faster.

There was also Bitcoin layer-2 network Mezo. The startup raised $21 million in a Pantera-led funding round.

During the first three months of 2024, global investors put $2.5 billion into crypto-related startups, according to PitchBook.

However, investors don’t appear to be warming up to blockchain-related gaming companies. According to data from DappRadar, the sector secured $288 million in funding for the first quarter of 2024. That’s a 57% decrease compared to the previous three-month period."

The latest correction marked the continuation of a trend that started on April 12 and worsened the next day.

Analysts estimate the crypto market liquidated more than $860 million in assets over two days; the price of Bitcoin initially fell from $71,000 to $65,000 and then dropped even more to the $61,000 level.

Market watchers have suggested the first drop was due to news from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which signaled it was not in a hurry to reduce interest rates.

This stance is driven by sticky inflation levels, which are causing unease domestically and influencing expectations regarding policy adjustments globally.

The second drop was due to the growing tension between Iran and Israel, with crypto traders being the first to react to the news since traditional financial markets were closed for the weekend.

Bitcoin, at last check, is trading at $64,123, which is still 5% lower than 24 hours ago. In the seven-day and 14-day timeframes, the loss is 7.5% and 8.6%, respectively. Over 30 days, the price dip amounts to slightly more than 6%.

The world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market cap is also down 13% from its highest price ever, which was $73,798 in March, but it’s still more than double what it was a year ago.

Experts from QCP said that Iran’s attack on Israel caused a lot of fear in the market. Ethereum (ETH) went down to $2,850, and other cryptocurrencies went down by 20–30% on average.

Per CoinGecko, among the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, only the Leo token (LEO), Bittensor (TAO), Celestia (TIA), and Wormhole (W) made gains in the last 24 hours.

The crypto data aggregator also indicated that the sector’s total market cap fell by 5.2% to $2.43 trillion following April 13.

The government is now hoping to bring him back to Nigeria.

Punchng.com, citing sources within the Nigerian presidency working on the case, confirmed that Anjarwalla’s whereabouts in Kenya are known.

Efforts are underway to coordinate with Kenyan authorities to return him to Nigeria.

Anjarwalla is believed to have reached Kenya and hid to evade the authorities.

He is alleged to have committed money laundering, tax evasion, and currency speculation to the tune of $35.4 million. The charges prompted collaborative efforts between Nigerian agencies like the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Nigeria Police, the Kenyan Police, and Interpol.

Furthermore, Punch highlighted the EFCC’s ongoing collaboration with international agencies, including the FBI and UK, Northern Ireland, and Kenyan authorities, to address the allegations.

This case dates back to February. Anjarwalla and another Binance executive, Tigran Gambaryan, were detained in Nigeria over claims of manipulating the Nigerian naira.

Subsequently, the EFCC took over the investigation, filing charges against Binance Holdings Limited, Gambaryan, and Anjarwalla.

While Gambaryan remains in EFCC custody, Anjarwalla managed to escape on March 22. He boarded a flight out of Abuja using his UK passport. He allegedly flew on a Middle Eastern airline.

It remains unclear how he managed to board the flight, as Nigerian authorities hold his UK passport, which was used to enter Nigeria.

Punch’s coverage also revealed ongoing interrogations of soldiers involved in monitoring Anjarwalla and the full-scale involvement of agencies like the military, the Department of State Services, the Police, and the National Intelligence Agency.

Binance announced on March 5 that it would halt all naira transactions, effectively leaving the market. The exchange also removed all naira trading pairs from its peer-to-peer platform.

The decision came on the heels of an intensified effort by the Nigerian government to combat suspected money laundering and target individuals allegedly using Binance for illicit activities.

The Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Olayemi Cardoso, previously expressed concerns about crypto exchanges in Nigeria handling illicit transactions exceeding $21.6 billion."

According to ZachXBT, an on-chain detective, the group has moved approximately $1 million in laundered funds to Base to fuel its new scam.

The unnamed group initially transferred the funds from an Ethereum (ETH) address linked to previous scams, from which they eventually found their way to another address on the Polygon network.

The alleged scammers then converted the assets into wrapped Ether (wETH) and moved them through multiple blockchain networks using bridging services such as Orbiter and Bungee.

Their strategy led them to the Blast network, where they allegedly funded an address possibly belonging to Leaper Finance, a decentralized over-collateralized lending protocol.

ZachXBT characterizes these transfers as a sudden surge in liquidity aimed at enticing unsuspecting individuals.

Concurrently, the blockchain investigator known for uncovering various scams in the crypto world pointed out that these same individuals are likely behind another Base project named ZebraLending, with a current total value locked (TVL) of about $311,000.

According to the investigator, the scammers often forge know-your-customer (KYC) documents and collaborate with dubious security auditing firms to appear legitimate.

History of scamming

The group has targeted other platforms, including Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum, Arbitrum (ARB), and Solana (SOL), showcasing their adaptability and widespread presence in blockchain.

According to ZachXBT, the scammers usually grow their honeypot projects to seven-figure values before executing a rug pull and making off with investors’ funds. The blockchain sleuth pointed to past projects, including Solfire Finance on Solana, Lendora Protocol on Scroll, and Magnate Finance on Base, as past handiworks of the group.

In the Magnate Finance incident, the group reportedly stole more than $6.5 million hours after ZachXBT, alongside other security experts, raised alarm over the project. In the Solfire scam, they made off with approximately $3 million.

Blast, a layer-2 (L2) network introduced by Blur founder Tieshun Roquerre, has recently been hit by several scams, exploits, and rug pulls. In February, a project on the platform, RiskOnBlast, suffered a rug pull, resulting in a loss of around 500 ETH.

In March, Super Sushi Samurai, a blockchain game native to the network, suffered a token exploit just before its gaming launch. The team confirmed an exploit of $4.6 million due to a smart contract bug, verified by on-chain security firm CertiK.

Deaton, a political upstart, made a name for himself last year for his support for Ripple (XRP) and involvement in several landmark crypto cases.

The lawyer, who founded CryptoLaw, has been vocal about his disagreements with Warren and Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), especially regarding their approach to crypto regulation.

In 2021, he sought to intervene in the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple on behalf of XRP holders, arguing their interests were not adequately represented. In early 2024, Deaton moved to Massachusetts and registered as a Republican to take on Warren.

However, despite his significant involvement in crypto, Deaton has repeatedly stated that he is not running on crypto. He also didn’t mention digital assets in his original campaign announcement on Feb. 20 (See below).

Deaton claims his decision to enter politics stems from a desire to address Warren’s policies directly.

Warren has been a vocal opponent of the crypto industry, advocating for stricter regulations, including measures against money laundering concerning digital assets.

Her stance has often sparked debates within the crypto community, with concerns that her policies could stifle innovation.

Poll says Warren vulnerable to Deaton

A recent Boston.com poll shows 57% of readers acknowledged that Deaton, or another Republican challenger, could beat Warren in this year’s upcoming election.

Some 39% said Warren was entrenched in her position.

Industry bigwigs and Warren critics — including Anthony Scaramucci, and the Winklevoss twins, as well as executives at Ripple — are reportedly determined to raise funds to defeat her.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also made significant contributions to Deaton’s campaign. Furthermore, billionaire Mark Cuban and Chamber of Digital Commerce founder Perianne Boring have also endorsed Deaton, highlighting growing support from within the crypto community.

Crypto industry flexing political muscle

The influx of donations underscores a concerted effort by crypto-focused PACs, which actively support candidates aligned with the industry’s interests.

Warren’s staunch opposition to crypto has made her a prime target.

The crypto super PACs reportedly donated substantially to candidates participating in the last Super Tuesday primary contests across Texas, California, and Alabama.

According to the reports, Fairshake, Protect Progress, and Defend American Jobs collectively spent at least $13 million on races held on March 5.

One notable target in those contests was Rep. Katie Porter, a progressive Democrat vying for California’s Senate seat. Fairshake reportedly allocated more than $10 million towards initiatives such as a statewide ad campaign urging Californians not to support Porter due to her previous criticisms of the industry.

Despite her popularity as a progressive figure known for her relatable persona, Porter lost in the primary election, trailing behind Republican Steve Garvey and fellow Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff.

The outcome was seen by many as a notable shift in the political landscape concerning digital asset-friendly candidates and their opponents."
https://crypto.news/coinbase-seeks-appeal-sec-case-crypto-classification/,Coinbase seeks appeal in SEC case over crypto classification,2024-04-13 19:28:49+00:00,"Julius Mutunkei, Anthony Patrick","Coinbase has filed a motion in federal court seeking permission to pursue an interlocutory appeal regarding a recent ruling concerning investment contracts.

The crypto exchange’s appeal focuses on whether a digital asset transaction, which does not involve any obligations to the original issuer of the asset, should be considered an investment contract regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

In March, Judge Katherine Failla denied Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s case against it. In her decision, she referenced an opinion from a judgment involving the defunct crypto company Terra, suggesting that certain digital assets could be deemed investment contracts under the Howey Test, especially if they are part of a broader ecosystem.

The Howey test is a legal standard used to determine whether certain transactions qualify as investment contracts. Coinbase views its application to digital assets as a pivotal legal question, especially given conflicting opinions from different judges. This disagreement, Coinbase argues, meets the criteria for a controlling question of law, a crucial factor in securing an interlocutory appeal.

As Fox journalist Eleanor Terrett noted on Friday, April 12, interlocutory appeals are typically challenging to obtain before a final judgment is rendered. See below.

🚨BREAKING: @coinbase has filed a motion seeking Judge Failla’s permission to seek an interlocutory appeal on her recent order involving investment contracts.

The SEC itself faced difficulties when it attempted a similar appeal in the Ripple case last July, disputing Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling on secondary market token sales.

However, despite the low likelihood of success for interlocutory appeals like the one Coinbase is filing, they can have significant implications if approved. If the appeals process moves forward, the industry could be closer to potential clarifications from higher courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court.

Coinbase responds

In a statement on social media, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, highlighted that the central question revolves around whether an investment contract necessitates “something contractual.”

Today @Coinbase filed a brief asking the Court’s permission to seek an interlocutory appeal in our @SECGov case on this controlling question: whether an “investment contract” requires something contractual – we think it does, the SEC disagrees. 1/5 https://t.co/M5HgMQxCLF — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) April 13, 2024

The exchange argues that an investment contract must involve contractual obligations after the sale, while the SEC maintains a different perspective.

The outcome of this legal dispute is important for the crypto sector in the U.S. The SEC’s classification of crypto transactions as investment contracts subjects them to regulatory oversight, including registration requirements.

However, industry players like Coinbase argue that once digital assets are traded on secondary markets and are no longer linked to their initial issuers, they should not fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction."

The brothers put $4.5 million worth of Bitcoin into the football club as part of a transaction facilitated through Winklevoss Capital, their investment firm.

This new partnership places them alongside cryptocurrency podcaster Peter McCormack, who acquired the club in 2022.

The Winklevoss twins’ financial infusion into Real Bedford is committed to several forward-looking projects. These include creating a new training facility, establishing a football academy and bolstering support for youth and girls’ football programs.

The twins became indirectly involved with the club in January 2022 after Gemini became one of its sponsors.

With this latest investment, Real Bedford also plans to establish a Bitcoin treasury.

Real Bedford’s connection to high-profile American investors echoes a similar trend seen with Wrexham AFC in Wales, which actors Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds purchased in February 2021 for £2 million ($2.5 million).

Like Reynolds and McElhenney, the Winklevoss twins are aligning their technological investment prowess with sports, expanding their influence beyond traditional business sectors into regional and community sports initiatives.

But the Winklevoss pair is just the latest in a long line of wealthy investors who see football clubs as a lucrative trophy asset.

According to a recent S&P Global report, “A couple of decades ago, sports teams were primarily viewed as risky vanity assets.”

Today, it’s a different scenario. The rising value of sports media rights and changes to players’ salaries have made sports an asset class that “combines market-beating returns with the defensiveness often seen in low-growth utilities.”

One team that’s reportedly seeking to sell a minority stake is Sporting Lisbon Football Club in Portugal.

Historically, geopolitical instability tends to drive investors away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, seeking safety in more stable investments.

This shift often results in sell-offs across risk asset classes, as observed in the recent downturn.

In the last 24 hours, 261,054 traders were affected, and $860.82 million in assets were liquidated as the overall crypto market cap plummeted nearly 5%.

Liquidation heatmap | Source: Coinglass

QCP Capital also observed the ETH risk reversal indicator played a significant role in the liquidation. The firm noted on Friday that there was a notable downside skew in the Ethereum risk reversal, which signaled a potential drop.

The risk reversal’s bearish skew indicates that traders were betting on ETH’s price dropping, a sentiment that likely stemmed from its use as a hedge.

This technical indicator proved accurate, as ETH’s value dropped over 5% to $3100. Typically, speculators holding long positions in altcoins use ETH puts to protect against downturns, making ETH prices particularly sensitive to shifts in market sentiment.

The fear permeating the crypto markets was palpable, further reflected in the negative swing of perpetual swap funding rates.

These rates plunged to over -40%, marking the deepest negative funding this year and signaling a strong bearish sentiment.

Additionally, this anxiety crushed the forward curve, with the front end falling below 10%, highlighting a bleak short-term outlook for cryptocurrency prices."

The continuous outflows from the ETF market could also be driven by a pre-halving pullback. There is a common anticipation that the Bitcoin halving generally leads to a larger bull market for the largest cryptocurrency. So, a pullback occurs when investors start taking profits in the short-term and tend to invest again when there is a dip.

However, it’s also likely that investors are cautious about the halving not producing substantial rallies like previous years, as Marathon Digital recently predicted that BTC has already reached its peak after the approval of ETFs earlier this year."

The breaches in 2022 resulted in the theft of over $12 million in different cryptocurrencies. The trial was the first-ever sentencing for a cyberattack on smart contracts.

Ahmed admitted in December 2023 to manipulating smart contracts. By inserting fraudulent pricing data into the platforms’ contracts, the engineer generated approximately $12 million in unearned profits, which he subsequently withdrew as cryptocurrency.

While the prosecutors chose not to disclose one of the affected platforms, evidence in the indictment suggests it was Crema Finance. The other platform involved was Nirvana Finance, which ceased operations following the hack in July 2022.

Before the incident, Ahmed had led Amazon’s bug bounty program, where he identified and fixed security loopholes in its software. The prosecution, highlighting the novelty of this case involving smart contract hacking, had recommended a four-year prison term.

They acknowledged Ahmed’s cooperation and his restitution of the majority of the stolen funds but emphasized the need for his imprisonment to serve as a deterrent and underscore the gravity of his offenses.

On the other hand, Ahmed’s defense argued for probation instead of prison time, citing his compromised mental health during the time of the hacks and the fact that the stolen funds were largely untouched except for covering a relative’s medical expenses.

The firm analyzed this year’s Google Trends data from across the globe and discovered that BTC halving interest scores increased from the previous cycle 51 to 100 days before the watershed event.

The first halving in November 2012 scored zero on the trends chart, as blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies were reasonably new to financial curiosity. The score rose to four by July 2016, and by the third halving in May 2020, it surged nearly 13 times.

Europe dominates BTC halving

European countries dominated Google search queries around the Bitcoin halving, despite the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and trading volumes of $200 billion. The top five countries included the Netherlands, Slovenia, Switzerland, Austria, and Singapore.

Excluding Singapore, the top 10 cities showing massive interest in Bitcoin’s halving were also found in Europe. According to CoinWire’s report, Zurich, the largest city in Switzerland, scored 100.

Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the Netherlands followed the Swiss giant with scores of 98 and 93, respectively. Austria’s Vienna and German Dusseldorf, Stuttgart, Munich, Frankfurt, and Cologne completed the list of 10 areas boasting the highest Bitcoin halving inquisitiveness.

While the U.S. came in at 22 among countries searching for Bitcoin halving information, states within America still showed high demand. CoinWire analysis showed that North and South Dakota scored 100, along with Zurich.

BTC halving could stir defi boom

Analysts posit that this year’s halving could differ regarding price impact and emerging narratives due to spot Bitcoin ETFs and a growing decentralized finance (defi) movement on Bitcoin’s blockchain.

Bitcoin defi emerged after developer Casey Rodarmor published the Ordinals protocol, allowing users to inscribe data on the smallest BTC unit known as Satoshi or SATS.

Pseudonymous builder Domo also expanded on the idea and created the BRC-20 standard, similar to Ethereum’s (ETH) ERC-20, the famous architecture employed for digital assets on crypto’s second-largest blockchain.

On April 12, a report revealed that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) initiated civil proceedings against the NGS companies and their directors, Brett Mendham, Ryan Brown, and Mark Ten Caten.

These companies are accused of persuading local investors to set up self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) and invest them in blockchain mining packages, promising fixed-rate returns.

The ASIC claims that around 450 investors placed approximately 62 million AUD ($40 million) with these firms, which lacked the necessary Australian financial license.

The commission was particularly concerned about the risk of losing the digital assets involved in blockchain mining and successfully obtained a Federal Court order to appoint liquidators to manage the digital currencies held by the NGS companies. Additionally, a travel ban was imposed on Mendham.

Furthermore, ASIC has taken steps to stop NGS companies from illegally providing financial services in Australia.

ASIC Chair Joe Longo warned Australians about the risks of investing SMSFs in cryptocurrencies and emphasized the commission’s dedication to monitoring crypto offerings to ensure they comply with regulations and protect investors.

Meanwhile, other Australian cryptocurrency organizations, such as DCA Capital, Digital Commodity Assets Pty Ltd, and the Digital Commodity Assets Fund, are undergoing liquidation and facing federal court actions.

Investor concerns about mismanagement, inadequate licensing, and possible violations of managed investment scheme regulations have triggered these proceedings.

KordaMentha, the liquidator, reported finding debts of 100 million AUD ($65 million) owed by these firms to 100 investors. The Federal Court has also frozen assets worth 55 million AUD ($36 million) belonging to Ashod Balanian, the director of DCA Capital, and ordered him to hand over his passport.

Following recent legal developments with the NGS companies, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is also appealing a Federal Court decision regarding Finder Wallet Pty Ltd. The court previously dismissed ASIC’s civil penalty lawsuit against Finder Wallet, a subsidiary of the digital currency exchange Finder.com.

Finder Wallet, which operated from late February to November 10, 2022, offered an investment product called Finder Earn. ASIC had accused the company of operating without an Australian Financial Services license and violating several regulatory obligations.

On March 14, 2024, Justice Brigitte Markovic ruled that the Finder Earn product did not qualify as a debenture under the Corporations Act, leading to the lawsuit’s dismissal.

In response to the appeal, a spokesperson for Finder Wallet told Crypto.news that it had been actively involved in proposing regulations and had engaged consistently with ASIC throughout the process.

Finder Wallet defended its product vigorously in court, emphasizing that the initial ruling was based on a detailed examination of all the evidence, which will remain unchanged in the appeal.

The firm also expressed respect for ASIC’s difficult position and highlighted their ongoing commitment to constructive dialogue. Additionally, they reiterated their dedication to innovation, emphasizing that their product was designed with the best interests of their customers in mind.

This appeal is part of ASIC’s new strategy to pursue riskier litigation cases, even at the risk of facing losses, to ensure stringent regulatory compliance in the complex cryptocurrency sector."

On April 11, Josie Osborne, Minister of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation, stated that the province is addressing the high energy consumption associated with cryptocurrency mining in the region, which, she noted, generates minimal job and economic opportunities.

According to the ministry, the legislative amendment would allow the government to prohibit or regulate the use of electricity by cryptocurrency miners. This is because the sector’s “unchecked growth” may make it expensive to supply electricity to homes and companies.

The province announced in December 2022 that new electricity connections for cryptocurrency mining would be suspended for 18 months.

Indeed, approximately twenty-one projects, which had collectively requested 11,700 gigawatt hours of power annually, were temporarily halted.

According to a local article, Minister Osborne stated that the province is collaborating with British Colombia Hydro, the provincial power utility, to secure adequate electricity for the province’s future.

“That includes regulating electricity service for energy-intensive cryptocurrency miners that create very few local jobs.”

A provincial Supreme Court concluded in February that BC Hydro’s embargo on crypto mining operations was ‘reasonable.’

Following Quebec and Manitoba, British Columbia became the third jurisdiction in Canada to put limitations on cryptocurrency mining in December 2022. BC has stated that it will not authorize new mining connections to its electricity system for 18 months.

Osborne stated at the time that the provision was intended to preserve electricity, mainly for “electric vehicles and heat pumps, and for businesses and industries that are undertaking electrification projects that reduce carbon emissions and generate jobs and economic opportunities.”

The move follows BlackRock’s foray into digital asset funds, listing a spot-based bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January, which amassed over $15 billion of assets under management. The company also filed for a spot ether (ETH) ETF last year.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a January interview with CNBC that BTC and ETH ETFs “are just stepping stones towards tokenization and I really do believe this is where we’re going to be going.”

Tokenization of real-world assets is a growing sector in the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance that involves placing traditional assets on blockchain rails in pursuit of faster settlements and increased efficiency."

The total volume of illicit crypto funds decreased by nearly one-third in 2023, according to research done by TRM Labs. The findings reveal that the volume fell from $49.5 billion in 2022 to $34.8 billion in 2023. The San Francisco-headquartered blockchain forensics firm noted that the decline outpaced the 22% reduction “seen in the overall cryptocurrency transaction volume during the same period.”

In addition to the overall decrease, the total value of funds sent to sanctioned addresses and entities also shrank: from $25.4 billion in 2022 to to $16.2 billion in 2023, TRM Labs says, adding that the decline was accompanied by “increased pressure from governments and law enforcement bodies.”

“Indeed, last year also saw a three-fold rise in sanctions against crypto-related businesses and individuals. Twelve ransomware groups, six high risk exchanges and a cryptocurrency mixing service featured among the 33 OFAC designations.” TRM Labs

Data gathered by btc.com showed that Bitcoin’s (BTC) mining difficulty achieved a record high of 86.4 trillion as companies generated massive amounts of computing capacity before the much-anticipated halving event later this month.

Mining difficulty refers to the computer-generated power needed to solve complex mathematical equations required for unlocking new Bitcoins. BTC is scheduled to undergo a code change by April 20, and the latest mining difficulty report is the final update before this halving.

According to btc.com, mining difficulty has increased by some 600% since 2020, when the last halving occurred. Also, it has been in a continuous uptrend since May 2021.

BTC miners are churning more computing power than ever as these entities look to stockpile the crypto and bolster cash reserves before block rewards are halved. For miners, block rewards are the main income source, and soon, the reward will be reduced to 3.15 BTC. The drop will also tighten daily Bitcoin issuance from 900 to 450.

Bitcoin halving could trigger short-term market decline

Historically, the asset declines between 15% to 40% pre-halving, per CoinMarketCap, and enters a parabolic increase in the long run following the code change. However, Bakhrom Saydulloev, Mercuryo product lead, told crypto.news that a short-mid term retrace triggered by miners liquidating BTC may happen.



Historical data shows that in the immediate aftermath of the halving, Bitcoin prices typically experience a decrease. At the same time, in the medium to long term, they tend to trigger bull runs. For instance, after a halving, some miners may feel pressured to sell their Bitcoin holdings to cover operational costs due to the 50% reduction in block rewards, affecting their profitability. This could lead to a market “sell-off” as some investors become uncertain about future price trends. Bakhrom Saydulloev, Mercuryo product lead

Saydulloev further opined that previous halving occurred during better economic and investment climates, citing the current uncertain trajectory around crypto regulations. Conversely, general sentiment posits that the presence of spot Bitcoin ETFs could incentivize cash flow into the cryptocurrency. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already garnered over $200 billion in trading volume in less than four months."

https://crypto.news/ceo-of-minima-on-the-next-frontier-of-depin/,CEO of Minima on the next frontier of DePIN,2024-04-11 13:14:20+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","DePIN has become the latest buzzword in decentralized space due to its limitless potential to revolutionize how we access real-world services. The use cases for the tech are vast, covering a lot of sectors, from wireless connectivity to data storage.

Crypto.news recently spoke with Hugo Feiler, CEO and co-founder of Minima, a layer1 blockchain, regarding the onset of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) and where this burgeoning sector is headed next.

With DePIN’s market cap reaching $20 billion and around 650 new projects launched, what innovations do you believe are driving this expansion, and how are you seeing projects diversify applications across Wi-Fi, transportation, and energy?

DePIN’s rise is marked by substantial market growth and the initiation of numerous projects. The groundwork for these developments was laid by earlier blockchain platforms like IOTA and subsequent initiatives like Helium and Filecoin, which have expanded the blockchain’s scope to various physical devices and data storage solutions. The evolving DePIN ecosystem is facilitating more efficient and transparent infrastructure systems, enhancing autonomous decision-making, and improving machine-to-machine interactions that enable advancements in AI, telecommunications, transportation, and IoT.

Infrastructure is something that can be bogged down by regulation. How do DePins account for that?

As regulatory frameworks evolve to support the decentralized paradigm, we can expect a more harmonious relationship between technology providers, users, and governing bodies, with an emphasis on security, data sovereignty, and ethical standards. The next decade for DePIN holds not just technological growth but also the promise of a more equitable and participatory digital ecosystem.

How do you think DePIN’s efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and user empowerment compare with centralized models, particularly in disrupting sectors dominated by large corporations?

DePIN architectures outstrip centralized models in efficiency by eliminating intermediary layers thus reducing transaction times and costs. Its cost-effectiveness is enhanced by the peer-to-peer nature of transactions which cuts out traditional fees and the need for expensive infrastructure. In terms of user empowerment, DePIN affords individuals greater control over their data and the services they use, a stark contrast to the user-as-a-product paradigm often seen in corporate-dominated sectors.

What main challenges do you think hinder DePIN adoption and scalability and what solutions are proposed for broader implementation?

The main challenges hindering DePIN adoption and scalability include the complexity of blockchain technology, which can intimidate users and developers, and the issue of interoperability, as different DePIN systems need to communicate effectively. Simplifying user interfaces and offering education on the technology are key to mitigating these complexities. Developing universal standards and open protocols is essential for achieving interoperability across platforms.

How do issues of interoperability intersect with regulatory issues?

To support decentralized infrastructures on a global scale, harmonized international regulations are crucial. This could involve the establishment of global standards for decentralized technologies (such as W3C for decentralized IDs) that would allow for interoperability and mutual recognition across borders. Additionally, the development of clear guidelines for the issuance and trading of digital assets, smart contract protocols, and consumer protection in the context of DePIN is essential. Creating regulatory sandboxes allows DePIN projects to test new products and services in a controlled environment with regulatory oversight, fostering innovation while ensuring consumer protection. Lastly, there’s a need for public-private partnerships to further understand the potential and limitations of DePIN, ensuring regulations support innovation without stifling it.

As DePIN enters domains like cloud computing and wireless connectivity, what strategies do you think could help compete against and capture market share from Big Tech?

As DePIN ventures into areas traditionally dominated by Big Tech, like cloud computing and wireless connectivity, a strategic approach focused on niche markets that do not necessitate massive centralized infrastructure can be advantageous.

Such as how?

Building community-based networks, like Helium or Wicrypt, can provide local, decentralized wireless connectivity, leveraging community management and ownership as a differentiator. Also via cost-effective solutions, such can offer more cost-effective computing or storage solutions than Big Tech can be a key strategy, particularly in emerging markets or for SMBs/SMEs that may not require large-scale infrastructure. Also by looking at innovative business models, such as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that can attract users looking for alternatives to the centralized corporate governance of Big Tech.

And how about security versus cost-efficiency, what can DePIN offer that traditional systems of infrastructure cannot?

DePIN’s attributes of censorship resistance and cost-efficiency position it as a compelling alternative in the cloud computing market. By offering secure, user-controlled environments free from monopolistic control, DePIN appeals to privacy-conscious users and cost-sensitive enterprises. This is a competitive edge that could drive a shift in market dynamics, fostering a more balanced ecosystem where decentralized and centralized services coexist, catering to diverse needs and potentially prompting innovation among traditional providers to retain market share.

Considering DePIN projects like Minima claiming even small devices can run a node, how do you see decentralized networks transforming the IoT landscape and possibly other sectors by 2030?

By 2030, decentralized networks like those used in DePIN projects could profoundly transform the IoT landscape. By enabling small devices to run full nodes, Minima could catalyze a revolutionary expansion of the IoT ecosystem. For enterprises, this equates to creating highly robust and secure networks for operations management. Smart factories could operate on an interconnected system where machines negotiate maintenance and supply needs autonomously, leading to dramatic improvements in efficiency and reductions in downtime. Also communities stand to benefit significantly as Minima facilitates the creation of decentralized services that are locally governed and maintained. For example, neighborhood-based microgrids could autonomously manage and distribute energy based on real-time demand and supply, optimizing community resource use and potentially lowering costs. In agriculture, for instance, sensor nodes across farms could provide precise data that enable farmers to engage in smart contracts for automated, data-driven crop insurance."

This rise followed a dip to local lows of $67,482 after the March U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report indicated a higher-than-anticipated 3.5% year-on-year increase. This development raised concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve might postpone interest rate cuts further.

Crypto industry observers have expressed optimism that the slowdown in GBTC outflows, which have totaled $16 billion since the fund transitioned to a spot Bitcoin ETF in January, may be beginning.

Thomas Fahrer, CEO of the crypto-focused reviews portal Apollo, queried his 41,500 X followers on April 11 if “GBTC selling [is] over?” He noted that the outflows on April 10 were about equivalent to 250 Bitcoin, nearly a 95% drop from the beginning of the week.

On April 8, just days prior, Grayscale saw outflows of 4,288 Bitcoin, totaling $303 million.

The lowest previous outflow was on Feb. 26, amounting to $22.4 million, with the average daily outflow over four months being $257.8 million.|

Among BTC ETFs, which include BlackRock IBIT, Fidelity FBTC, ARK’s ARKB, and Bitwise BITB, only these registered positive inflows on April 10, according to Farside data.

FBTC led with an inflow of $76.3 million, its largest since April 5, bringing its total inflows to $8,043.2 billion. The collective net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs now stand at $12,494.5 billion.

The upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected around April 20, is another focal point for the market. The event will halve the Bitcoin block issuance rate from 6.25 coins per block to 3.125.

Halvings, which occur every four years, have historically led to a surge in Bitcoin’s price due to the reduced supply growth.

With the current enthusiasm around spot Bitcoin ETFs, the market anticipates even greater demand, potentially intensifying the rally.

In a Bloomberg interview on April 9, Fred Thiel, CEO of Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital, suggested that recent spot Bitcoin ETF approvals have brought substantial capital into the market, thereby accelerating the market’s appreciation, which was typically anticipated after the halving of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s price has seen a more than 60% increase in the months leading to the halving, with experts indicating a continued bullish market driven mainly by growing demand rather than the halving’s supply cut.

“The past halvings have brought remarkable supply shock, but this year’s event will be different. This is because we’ve never had both a supply shock and a demand shock at the same time. And the catalyst is undoubtedly ETFs – single-day inflows into spot BTC ETFs have already topped $1 billion, “Andras Kristof, CEO and co-founder of Galaxis, told Crypto.news.

He went on to suggest that if demand for the new ETFs is as great as it is now, it will just add to the daily buying pressure. Against the backdrop of reducing supply, this could result in a significant spike in bitcoin price and volatility.

“While the price of Bitcoin has more than doubled over the past year, there is steam left in the rally. The halving effect will very likely pull institutional investors in from the sidelines as they succumb to the fear of missing out.”"

Bitcoin‘s demand from long-term holders has surged past issuance levels for the first time in the cryptocurrency’s history, according to a recent research report from CryptoQuant.

The cohort of long-term holders is now adding around 200,000 BTCs per month, analysts say, adding that the figure is far exceeding the monthly issuance of approximately 28,000 BTC.

Analysts at CryptoQuant noted that with the upcoming halving set to reduce monthly issuance to about 14,000 BTC, such a demand marks a significant shift in Bitcoin’s supply-demand dynamics.

Commenting on the upcoming halving, Tezos co-founder Arthur Breitman described the event as a “reduction in security budget,” suggesting that while the reward change for miners could benefit the Bitcoin ecosystem in the short term by potentially addressing overpayment for security, underscoring the need for future adjustments to emission policies to maintain security.

“Today, this is a good thing because Bitcoin likely overpays for security at the moment, but it’s also a reminder that, in the long run, the emission policy will have to change to maintain security. Financial projections based on the halving are unserious.” Arthur Breitman

Despite Breitman’s caution, crypto executives hold differing views. Arthur Hayes, former head of BitMEX, anticipates BTC price declines before and after the halving, attributing it to limited dollar liquidity during this period. Meanwhile, Marathon CEO Fred Thiel suggests that the halving’s impact may already be priced in, citing successful spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals.

As Bitcoin miners prepare for reduced rewards, the upcoming halving in mid-April will cut mining rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block. This process occurs automatically, with the Bitcoin network protocol adjusting itself upon reaching a programmed block height. The milestone of mining all 21 million BTCs is projected around 2140, after which miners will rely solely on transaction fees for rewards."

The latest decline coincided with the exchange receiving an official investigation Wells notice from the SEC.

The market cap of UNI token saw a 17% loss in the hours since the news broke, with the token now trading at $5.54 million, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Uniswap Labs founder Hayden Adams expressed his frustration and readiness to contest the SEC’s action foreseeing a lengthy legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court.

Uniswap contends that UNI does not constitute a security and thus falls outside the regulatory scope of a securities exchange or broker, a stance outlined in a recent blog post without detailing the Wells notice.

Bill Hughes, Consensys’ Senior Counsel and Director of Regulatory Matters discussed the process required for the SEC to officially file a lawsuit, noting that approval from the agency’s five commissioners is necessary.

“We all know that the Chair wants to sue them, and two commissioners are NOT going to disagree, and two will disagree,” Hughes wrote. “So a suit is a foregone conclusion, but there isn’t a suit yet.”

https://twitter.com/BillHughesDC/status/1778146519125774761

He also advised the community to remain calm, emphasizing the unlikelihood of the SEC targeting UNI holders or users directly.

Former SEC internet enforcement chief John Reed Stark criticized Uniswap’s public reaction to the Wells notice as counterproductive, emphasizing that aggressive defense strategies against the SEC typically fail.

“Any SEC lawyer will agree that responding to a Wells by berating the SEC, calling them names, etc. is a weak, risky and losing strategy.”

The broader context of this legal challenge reflects ongoing tensions between the SEC and the cryptocurrency industry. The sector has accused the SEC of overreach and lack of clear regulatory guidelines, while SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and supporters, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, maintain that the industry is seeking exemptions from established securities laws.

This context is shaped by other notable lawsuits involving Coinbase and Ripple, focusing on the SEC’s digital assets jurisdiction. Outcomes have been mixed, with recent rulings favoring the SEC, but Uniswap’s defense remains uncertain given defi’s peculiarities and its past legal victory in a class-action lawsuit.

The controversy occurs as defi has seen significant growth, with Uniswap facilitating over $2 trillion in transactions and attracting interest from traditional finance sectors.

A recent legal decision in the SEC’s case against Coinbase highlighted distinctions in the regulatory treatment of decentralized services, which may bolster Uniswap’s defense despite concerns over its control over certain platform features."

A recent study conducted by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has unveiled a significant concentration within the crypto trading landscape, raising concerns about its potential implications for market stability. According to the study titled “Crypto assets: Market structures and EU relevance,” only 10 crypto exchanges handle approximately 90% of all trades, with Binance accounting “for almost half of global trading volumes.”

Collectively, Binance, UPbit, and OKX control over 60% of the market share, with Bybit experiencing a 380% increase in trading volume year-over-year, while Coinbase saw a 44% decline for the same period, the study shows. ESMA warns that such concentration carries potential risks, expressing significant concerns about the potential fallout of a major asset or exchange failure on the broader crypto ecosystem.

“Moreover, we find that market liquidity can vary widely and tends to be higher in the largest exchanges.” ESMA

The European securities regulator also pointed out that contrary to popular belief, cryptocurrencies do not consistently serve as a safe haven during periods of market stress, saying cryptocurrencies “are strongly interconnected” with equities and “no stable relationship with gold” has been found.

Despite regulatory efforts such as the EU Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license, the study suggests that a substantial portion of transactions executed on EU-licensed exchanges likely occur outside the EU, underscoring the need for continued monitoring and regulation of the crypto market."

The announcement on April 10 was part of a comprehensive status update to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York regarding the recovery and distribution of assets to creditors after the company’s financial downturn.

The report specified that a significant portion of the recovered funds, approximately $450 million, will be sourced from the settlement with FTX. This amount, which includes interest, is said to represent about 25% of the original claims made by Voyager creditors. The company expects to distribute this in an upcoming round.

Additionally, in the ongoing proceedings with Three Arrows Capital, Voyager has secured a claim of roughly $675 million. From this, Voyager’s pro rata share of the initial distribution amounts to $20.43 million.

The plan administrator anticipates more payments over the coming years as assets are liquidated and litigation recoveries are achieved.

A settlement in the D&O insurance mediation will also contribute at least $14.35 million to Voyager creditors, marking another effort to remedy the financial distress caused to the company’s stakeholders.

Voyager’s report went on to address logistical challenges, including around 270,000 uncashed checks totaling $17 million.

A significant portion of these checks, around 187,000, are for amounts less than $25.

The company has announced an April 20, 2024, deadline, after which all outstanding checks will be considered unclaimed and canceled.

The firm is also navigating the aftermath of a data breach, with investigations ongoing to ascertain the breach’s source and full impact.

The breach compromised creditor information, adding another layer of complexity to the bankruptcy proceedings.

Voyager initially sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022 amidst the wider crypto credit crisis, affecting numerous lenders and brokers.

The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved Voyager’s bankruptcy proposal on May 17, 2023, following crypto exchange Binance.US’s withdrawal of their intention to purchase $1 billion in assets from Voyager on April 25.

In October 2023, Stephen Ehrlich, co-founder of Voyager Digital, faced charges from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for alleged fraud and failure to register with the agency.

The CFTC accused Ehrlich and Voyager of misleading clients about the firm’s financial health as it neared collapse.

At the time of filing for bankruptcy, Voyager disclosed liabilities ranging between $1 billion to $10 billion, highlighting the severe financial challenges leading to its need for bankruptcy protection."

Data from Santiment shows that the number of daily active addresses has also declined along with the BTC whale activity — falling from 898,850 addresses to 866,140 active wallets over the past 24 hours.

On the other hand, the BTC Relative Strength Index (RSI) increased from 48 to 54 over the past day, according to Santiment data. The indicator shows that Bitcoin is slightly overheated but is still in good condition.

Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the South District of New York is scheduled to rule on how long Salame will spend in jail for making illegal political donations under the instruction of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

Salame also admitted to conspiracy charges related to running an unlicensed money transfer business in Alameda Research. According to federal prosecutors, Salame acted as a straw donor for Bankman-Fried’s political lobbying and made at least 300 contributions to U.S. bipartisan campaigns.

FTX execs await sentencing

Court dockets revealed that May 1 was the initial date for Salame’s sentencing, but the reasons for the shift are unclear. Other Bankman-Fried comrades like FTX co-founder Gary Wang, former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, and ex-lead engineer Nishad Singh also await sentencing.

All pled guilty to violations during their time in Bankman-Fried’s empire and testified as government witnesses after agreeing to plea deals. Meanwhile, the FTX founder himself was found guilty of seven criminal charges, including fraud, last year.

Judge Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison and ordered that he repay over $8 billion stolen from his companies.

Cantor Fitzgerald is a custodian for Tether Holdings, the largest issuer of stablecoins, which has been scrutinized regarding its backing claims.

Lutnick contends that stablecoins contribute positively to the U.S. economy by driving demand for U.S. Treasuries and representing a non-systemic risk.

The testnet’s objectives include the integration of OM as the chain’s native token, facilitating developer access to the smart contract platform CosmWasm, developing a new user interface, custom modules, a phased approach to validator onboarding, and user engagement activities.

The testnet offers developers access to modules designed for compliance, including an on-chain Decentralized ID (DID) system, a Token Service module for creating and minting permission tokens, and a guard module for application access control. The features are intended to support MANTRA’s focus on security and compliance.

Participants can engage in activities on GALXE, such as wallet creation, token collection, swaps, and DID minting, for an opportunity to receive part of the 50 million OM allocated for the mainnet launch."

The conversation around Base’s performance has ignited discussions within the crypto community. A trader, Wazz, responding to Pollak, suggested that Base’s TPS was on par with the Solana network, known for its high TPS but also a high rate of failed transactions.

Correct me if I'm wrong but if true then @base is now doing the same TPS as Solana

The Sui expansion came after New York’s state regulators mandated the cessation of the Paxos-issued Binance USD stablecoin, catapulting FDUSD’s trading volume to exceed $10 billion in the past day.

Increased volume is primarily attributed to trades pairing FDUSD with bitcoin, ether, and USDT on the Binance platform. Data from CoinGecko highlights that over 90% of this trading activity involves these specific pairings.

The Sui blockchain has also recently witnessed a significant uptick in defi activities. According to DefiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) in the Sui network, which indicates the overall value of assets held within its ecosystem, has surged from $100 million to approximately $700 million within the last six months.

By integrating FDUSD into the Sui network, First Digital Trust pioneers the issuance of a leading stablecoin on this network. The launch also addresses the inefficiencies associated with transferring stablecoins like USDC and USDT from other blockchains to Sui, which previously required users to incur additional fees and face potential risks associated with using bridges for such transfers."

“ASIC has appealed the Federal Court’s decision to dismiss ASIC’s proceedings against Finder Wallet Pty Ltd for allegedly providing unlicensed financial services,” the regulator said in an April 10 statement.

In December 2022, ASIC sued Finder Wallet, a subsidiary of Finder.com, an AUSTRAC-registered digital currency exchange. Finder Wallet, which was live from late February to Nov. 10, 2022, offered its users an investment product dubbed Finder Earn.

With Finder Earn, customers could deposit Australian dollars into their accounts. This was then converted to TAUD, an Australian dollar-backed stablecoin, and allocated to Finder Wallet for use as operating capital. In return, the users would receive annual compounding returns of 4.01%.

In its lawsuit, the Australian regulator claimed that the Finder Wallet provided financial services without an Australian Financial Services license. Further, the regulator alleged that the service was also in violation of product disclosure laws and also disregarded design and distribution obligations (DDO).

The commission labeled the Finder Earn product a debenture, with Sarah Court, deputy chair of ASIC, stating back then that offering a cryptocurrency product “does not automatically mean that it will be exempt from the present regulatory framework.”

On March 14, 2024, Justice Brigitte Markovic of the Australian Federal Court ruled that ASIC has not established that the Finder Earn product is a debenture” under the nation’s Corporations Act.

“As each of the contraventions of the Corporations Act alleged by ASIC is predicated on establishing that the Finder Earn product is a debenture, those contraventions cannot be made out. Thus the proceeding should be dismissed with costs,” Justice Markovic said in her final ruling.

However, the Australian regulator is not convinced and is determined to move ahead with its appeal.

“ASIC has appealed this decision because it is concerned that the Finder Earn product was offered without the appropriate license or authorization and therefore without the benefit of important consumer protections,” the regulator added.

The data for the appeal to be heard in Federal Court is yet to be determined."

Following the marketwide decline, the leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), slightly dipped after a short-term bullish momentum on April 9. BTC slipped by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $68,900 at the time of writing.

ETH recorded a 3.3% fall over the past day and is trading at $3,510 at the reporting time.

If the unveiled readings are exactly as projected, the chief analyst at Bitget Ryan Lee says, “it will amplify the likelihood of an interest rate cut in June as speculations regarding a Fed pivot are soaring.”

“While inflation is not really at the Federal Reserve’s preferred level of around 2%, the current reading is a significant improvement from the 10.6% recorded as of March 2023.” Ryan Lee, the chief analyst at Bitget, told crypto.news.

Per an X post by Investing.com, the February CPI rate was at 3.2% and is expected to reach 3.4% in March.

https://twitter.com/Investingcom/status/1777921011100336517

Lee added this improvement has steered the speculation of a rate cut from the 5.25%-5.5% bank fund rate as early as June. He said:

“The speculations that are likely to grow in the coming months will stir volatility in markets and the uncertainty might test the resilience of many stocks. In all, investors will need to trust that the Fed knows what it is doing and things will work out for all stakeholders in the long term.”

On the other hand, the stock market witnessed a green day on April 9. The S&P 500, for example, surged by 0.14%, gaining 7.52 points, and is standing at 5,209.91.

The upcoming halving of Bitcoin, set for mid-April, might already be accounted for to some extent, as suggested by Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest public U.S. crypto mining company. In an interview with Bloomberg, Thiel attributed Bitcoin’s recent surge to an all-time high partly to the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has attracted increased capital into the market.

“I think the ETF approval, which has been a huge success, has attracted capital into the market and essentially brought forward what could have been the price appreciation we typically would have seen three to six months post halving.” Fred Thiel

While acknowledging the role of ETF approvals in the current market dynamics, Thiel hinted that Bitcoin’s rally may not be fully exhausted, suggesting potential further growth post-halving. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin has witnessed a 60% surge in price value, outperforming Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins in terms of percentage profit.

Commenting on the upcoming halving, Thiel expressed enthusiasm, despite its implications for reducing Bitcoin’s supply by about 450 BTC per day and cutting miners’ rewards for block production by half: from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.

“But as miners we are very excited to go into a halving, where for once prices have not declined prior to the halving rather prices have gone up so everybody is obviously maximizing to that.” Fred Thiel

Thiel estimated that post-halving, Marathon’s break-even rate would hover around $46,000 per Bitcoin to maintain profitability. As of press time, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $68,826, with the total market value standing at $2.57 trillion, while Marathon’s MARA stock price has experienced a decline of over 20% year-to-date, according to data from Google."

According to data from the block, the platform is managing over 1.03 million ETH, significantly higher than its competitors. The closest to this is the Renzo protocol, which manages $2.9 billion in user deposits as of April 9—a hefty difference.

The liquid restaking sector has witnessed massive growth over the past months. The surge has been primarily attributed to deposits on the EigenLayer protocol. Ether.fi alone has received more than $1.5 billion worth of deposits over the past month.

Last month, Ether.fi saw 120,000 ETH staked from an address owned by Tron founder Justin Sun.

Ether.fi is currently hosting a staking campaign dubbed “staking frens” in a bid to further bolster its TVL. A user who stakes 1 ETH will be rewarded with 1 ETHFI, the platform’s native token, every day until the campaign ends on April 18. Furthermore, stakers will also earn a share of $500K USD worth of ZK tokens.

Ether.fi lets users access restaking yields via the EigenLayer protocol. Built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, the EigenLayer protocol allows users to stake their ETH or Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) across multiple protocols.

Liquid restaking through EigenLayer offers the dual benefit of participating in its diverse services while retaining the liquidity and accessibility of users’ ETH capital. By continuing to accept ether deposits, these protocols re-stake them and issue derivative tokens, such as Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs).

This provides users additional incentives to engage with the ecosystem, which in turn draws in deposits on LRTs like Ether.fi, further boosting the TVL.

LRT protocols also present a viable alternative for users lacking the 32 ETH required for native or direct staking. This accessibility has been a contributing factor to the massive asset accumulation within the top protocols, which now totals $9.7 billion. This figure represents over two-thirds of the TVL on EigenLayer, which stands at $13.58 billion.

Amidst this growing demand for LRT protocols, Google Could has launched its EigenLayer mainnet node operator. It is currently listed as a node operator on the Goerli testnet for EigenLayer."

EOS Network, a blockchain platform powered by the EOS virtual machine, has announced the development of exSat, a docking layer, aimed at bridging the gap between Bitcoin‘s mainnet and a diverse array of layer-2 scaling solutions within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

In a blog announcement on Apr. 10, the exSat Network team said their solution could potentially expand Bitcoin’s data consensus to enhance “interoperability, scalability, and security within the Bitcoin ecosystem.”

“By facilitating direct queries of BTC and ecosystem token balances, exSat enables a seamless flow of assets and information across different networks and Bitcoin layer-2 scaling solutions.” The exSat Network team

Powered by a hybrid consensus mechanism that merges proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and delegated proof-of-stake, exSat wants to expand Bitcoin’s functionalities by synchronizing block data between Bitcoin miners and the exSat Network.

Additionally, exSat implements decentralized state data indexing for native assets, enabling streamlined querying and improved interoperability across not only native BTCs, but also extensions like Runes, BRC-20, and BRC-721. The team also emphasizes opportunities for Solidity developers to build diverse applications on the new network, with support for universal gas fees for BTC, Ordinals, Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins.

To participate in the network as validators, users would need to stake over 100 BTC (equivalent to around $7 million) to qualify as a validator node. Additionally, nodes must stake XSAT tokens to earn revenue rights."

Google Cloud had previously taken part in EigenLayer’s “Operator Working Group” alongside 65 other operators and solo stakers, the developer behind EigenLayer reportedly said in a statement.

Google Cloud web3 is currently listed as a node operator on the Goerli testnet for EigenLayer, a restaking protocol that allows ether (ETH) to be staked on several platforms at once. The protocol went live for stakers in June.

However, operators who boost security and allow stakers to delegate assets have been on the testnet until now. The deployment of Google Cloud’s mainnet operator is a critical step towards realizing EigenLayer’s true vision.

Google Cloud, Google’s cloud computing service, has been steadily marching into Web3 since Bloomberg first revealed the company’s formation of a blockchain arm in January 2022.

Later that year, Google Cloud released the Blockchain Node Engine, a service meant to let developers run blockchain network nodes more easily. Google Cloud launched a web3 startup program in April 2023.

Google Cloud has shown interest in staking before the EigenLayer integration, becoming a Polygon validator in September. However, the tech behemoth made a relatively modest investment: Google Cloud has the second-smallest stake among more than 100 validators.

In October 2023, the cross-chain protocol LayerZero announced a partnership with Google Cloud, serving as LayerZero’s default oracle for verifying transactions between blockchains.

Google Cloud’s entry into web3 has sparked debate, with some considering the massive cloud computing service’s existence as a major blow to decentralization."

“This is where the action is, this is a bastion of freedom […] Every regime that has tried to shut it down has failed,” he said.

Known as an advocate for financial innovation, McHenry stressed that his colleagues in Congress must become well-versed in Bitcoin (BTC) to avoid the pitfalls of ill-informed policymaking in the fireside chat. The Republican highlighted the awkward moments when lawmakers inquire about obscuring transactions with Bitcoin, not realizing it operates on a transparent ledger.

“The dumbest way to try to obscure your transactions are to do them in public,” he stated, adding that cash remains the primary tool in illicit finance due to misconceptions about Bitcoin’s transparency.

“Stablecoins may still be unregulated or lightly regulated in other jurisdictions,” said the report,

Moreover, it underscores the importance of ensuring stablecoins are interoperable with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and other digital assets to promote a cohesive financial ecosystem.

In a recent post, Hayes questioned whether Bitcoin (BTC) could hold its all-time high as it approaches halving.

In his recent forecast, Hayes expects BTC prices to decline before and after the halving event, suggesting that during this period, dollar liquidity will be limited, contributing to increased pressure from sellers of crypto assets.

The BitMEX founder also predicts that after May 1, the quantitative tightening (QT) cycle will ease, returning to a standard rhythm in line with U.S. inflation trends.

“The Bitcoin block reward is forecast to halve on April 20. This is seen as a bullish catalyst for crypto markets. I agree that it will pump prices in the medium term; however, the price action directly before and after could be negative.” Arthur Hayes, BitMEX founder

As a result, Hayes has decided to hold off on trading until May, when the Federal Reserve is expected to discuss a potential reduction in its QT program.

On April 8, Bitcoin rose above $72,000 for the first time since mid-March. The impetus for the growth of the leading cryptocurrency is the upcoming Bitcoin halving, after which the block reward will be halved to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.

In contrast to Hayes, many experts expect an increase in Bitcoin’s value. Skybridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci believes that the BTC rate in this “bullish cycle” will reach $170,000, and in the future, Bitcoin’s capitalization will be half of that of gold."

In a blog post, Cronje wrote that most concerns around meme coins center around teams selling tokens, early investors liquidating large amounts, developers withdrawing liquidating, and creators retaining access control post-launch.

The issues have been evident in several meme tokens launched in recent months, some of which turned out to be rug pulls and cash grabs. In a lot of cases, early investors, usually involved in pre-sale raises, tanked market prices after launch, or the meme coin developer dumped a large amount on new users in the open market.

Andre Cronje’s meme coin fix

Fantom Foundation Co-Founder Andre Cronje proposed allocating up to 10% of the token supply for marketing expenses such as airdrops, exchange listings, Key Opinion Leader over-the-counter deals, and social media promotions. Cronje said this amount would be secured at a multi-signatory address requiring three individual approvals.

A multi-sig holding 5% of the supply would be sufficient to bankroll meme team expenses, Cronje also wrote in his Medium post. The remaining 85% of tokens would be designated to a liquidity pool (LP) paired with Fantom’s native cryptocurrency FTM.

An initial 100,000 FTM would be tendered to any Fantom-based automated market market voted for by the meme coin community. Additionally, Cronje suggested withdrawing this amount and burning liquidity if the LP’s FTM exceeded two million FTM.

The Fantom developer stressed that the meme coin must have no minting or ownership features, and offered to coordinate the project’s launch on X.

“The token does not allow purchases or sales greater than 1% of the nominated LP pool in a single transaction. This will avoid initial launch sniping as well as potential large future dumps by early members, and will not impact any other liquidity pools created.” Andre Cronje, Fantom Foundation co-founder

According to a press release shared with Crypto.news, the addition of these Gateways represents a pivotal development for POKT Network and its ecosystem to offer dependable and cost-efficient data access solutions, aiding developers and enterprises in enhancing application quality and user experience.

Dermot O’Riordan, Director at the POKT Network Foundation, stated that these Gateways are akin to Layer 2 solutions in terms of improving scalability, enabling builders to connect directly to a scalable and reliable decentralized infrastructure.

“By accommodating access and demand on a scale previously unseen, we’re not just expanding the capabilities of our network, we’re laying the groundwork for a future where access to any large open data source is unfettered, secure, and universally available,” Riordan added.

Gateways allow a wide range of businesses to offer access to POKT Network’s infrastructure without the need for direct maintenance, promoting a decentralized business model. The structure aims to lower market entry times, reduce operational costs, and shift focus towards customer service enhancements.

Since its inception, POKT Network has rapidly expanded its Gateway offerings, growing from a single Gateway to six in just seven months, reflecting a strategic push to improve network capacity.

Daniel Olshansky, Head of Protocol at POKT Network, explained that the strategy allows for a division of responsibilities: protocol participants focus on infrastructure maintenance, Gateways on performance, and users gain access to reliable and affordable services.

The collaboration with Developer DAO, Porters, and Chainstack is notable for its potential to drive network growth and innovation. Developer DAO, for instance, aims to reinvest RPC revenues into public goods, highlighting a model where technological advancements serve the common good. Porters and Chainstack, on the other hand, bring technical expertise and significant volume potential to the partnership.

Looking forward, POKT Network is preparing for the Shannon Upgrade in the summer of 2024. The upgrade aims to simplify integration for RPC providers and projects, easing access to data across different blockchains and AI. The upgrade is expected to support a broader range of use cases and encourage collaboration within the decentralized data infrastructure space."

The scams were first spotted by the research group Mysk, which pointed out that a verified YouTube account was live-streaming a solar eclipse. The stream, titled “Live: Solar Eclipse Spectacular 2024 of SpaceX,” reportedly showed a deepfake video of SpaceX founder Elon Musk.

In the video, the fake Musk was seen urging users to scan a QR code on the screen and deposit cryptocurrencies to have them doubled. Scanning the QR code directed users toward a website displaying the scammer’s wallet addresses, accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many popular cryptocurrencies.

According to the research group, the live stream was the first search result when looking for “solar eclipse livestream.”

At its peak, the livestream had over 95,000 viewers.

Another live stream, spotted by X user Jason Paladino, titled “2024 Total Solar Eclipse: Through the Eyers of SpaceX,” garnered over 164,000 live viewers. In the live stream chat, the scammers used a fake Elon Musk YouTube account to promote the same crypto doubling scam.

The scammers promoted a Russian website that was registered on the same day to receive cryptocurrencies from victims.

These giveaway scams have been a major talking point in the cryptocurrency sector for years. Last year, a similar scheme saw scammers getting away with $165,000 in crypto from unsuspecting users. The scammers were once again utilizing live streams on YouTube and redirecting users to their fraudulent websites via a QR code scan.

The scams aren’t limited to impersonating Elon Musk or SpaceX. Several personalities from and beyond the cryptocurrency industry have seen their reputations tarnished by these bad actors.

Back in 2020, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, along with 17 other victims, sued YouTube to take down similar scams impersonating them to promote fake Bitcoin giveaways.

Unfortunately, such scams are not isolated to YouTube. In February 2024, analysts at security firm CertiK discovered scammers impersonating Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, using a deepfake video to promote a wallet drainer phishing site.

Meanwhile, the social media platform TikTok has also become a playground for such scams, as was highlighted in a 2023 report. Scammers followed a similar pattern and were seen promoting cryptocurrency scams under the guise of reputed firms, most commonly Elon Musk and SpaceX, due to close ties with the crypto realm."

Aptos Labs, the firm behind the Aptos blockchain ecosystem, has entered into a partnership with io.net, a provider of decentralized GPU compute solutions in a bid to decentralize access to artificial intelligence (AI) resources as more venture capital firms are taking aim at the rapidly growing technology.

According to a press release shared with crypto.news, io.net and Aptos Labs will collaborate on developing a suite of AI models and inference products for their future release on the Aptos network. These future offerings will apparently leverage the Aptos network to facilitate payments.

The press release notes that io.net’s generative AI product dubbed BC8.ai is already using Aptos to “process over 500,000 transactions a day,” which is why io.net decided to deepen its collaboration with Aptos. Aptos Labs head Mo Shaikh emphasized the shared vision of io.net and Aptos, saying both entities aim to de-risk and decentralize AI applications on the Aptos platform.

“io.net’s vision for an accessible, decentralized, and responsible future for AI mirrors Aptos’ vision for the future of blockchain — and the next phase of the internet for billions of people.” Mo Shaikh

Aptos’ latest partnership aligns with investors’ increasing interest in the potential synergies between blockchain and AI. In December 2023, analysts at the crypto venture giant a16z crypto released a research paper outlining key areas where blockchain technology could complement artificial intelligence. They particularly emphasized that blockchain networks could serve as a “counterbalancing force to centralized AI,” fostering multi-sided, global, permissionless markets where anyone can contribute.

Meanwhile, venture capital firms are showing heightened interest in this intersection, with over a fifth of all venture funding in February allocated to AI companies, totaling $4.7 billion in investments. This marked a significant increase from the $2.2 billion invested in AI companies in January and the $2.1 billion invested in February 2023, according to data from Crunchbase."
https://crypto.news/analyst-predicts-bitcoin-to-hit-150k-by-2025-uptick-in-microstrategy-stock/,"Analyst predicts Bitcoin to hit $150k by 2025, uptick in Microstrategy stock",2024-04-09 10:28:20+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","The Benchmark Company analyst Mark Plamer expects Bitcoin’s price to hit $150,000 by the end of 2025.

Palmer’s comments came via an April 8 investor note, in which he raised his price target for MicroStrategy (MSTR) to $1,875, almost doubling from his previous target of $990.

Palmer’s optimism about MSTR is based on the company’s Bitcoin holdings. The analyst expects the flagship cryptocurrency to hit a price of “$150,000 by 2025.” He noted that MicroStrategy’s massive Bitcoin holdings will greatly benefit from the upcoming halving event, as the supply of Bitcoin will be reduced to half.

The $150,000 price target for Bitcoin is also higher than Palmer’s Feb. 27 prediction that the price would touch $125,000. Following this analysis, BTC rallied approximately 27%, leading to the analyst’s higher price target.

In a subsequent interview with Yahoo Finance, the Benchmark analyst highlighted the historical impact of the halving event on BTC prices. He noted that Bitcoin halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020 were followed by significant price appreciations due to the supply shock they created.

He went on to add that the upcoming halving could mimic a similar scenario. The impact could also be further intensified by the shock in demand, which analysts expect to be created by the spot Bitcoin ETF products. Palmer expects the demand for these ETF products to catapult further as more institutions enter the scene.

Another factor Plamer has considered in his prediction for the MSTR stocks target is the company’s tendency to strategically accumulate Bitcoin.

The firm, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has been accumulating Bitcoin at an average price of $35,160. According to saylortracker, MicroStrategy holds 214,245 Bitcoins as of April 9.

Palmer expects this trend to continue, highlighting that the company has increased its Bitcoin holdings for 15 consecutive quarters. The analyst expects Saylor’s firm to hold approximately 298,246 Bitcoins by year-end 2025, a 40% increase from current holdings.

The company is expected to do this using funds from capital raises and excess cash from its enterprise software business.

Several analysts are touting the post-halving scenario as a bullish period for Bitcoin. Palmer’s sentiments over Bitcoin were also echoed by Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, who expects the flagship crypto to hit at least $170,000 within the 18-month post-halving cycle.

Similarly, analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex also reported a price target for BTC between $150,000-169,000. However, analysts noted that this halving is different from the previous one’s because BTC had already hit an all time high prior to the event."

Switzerland is unlikely to introduce a public central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the near future, as risks associated with the technology still outweigh potential benefits, Reuters reports, citing Thomas Jordan, the head of the Swiss National Bank (SNB).

Speaking at an event in Zurich, Jordan noted there are many efficient and innovative payment solutions already available to consumers and businesses through the private sector, adding that a retail CBDC could significantly reshape the existing monetary framework.

“Retail CBDC could fundamentally alter the current monetary system and the role of central banks and commercial banks, with far-reaching consequences for the financial system.” Thomas Jordan

So far, the SNB has done multiple trials leveraging wholesale CBDC, facilitating transactions using central bank funds between commercial banks like UBS and Zuercher Kantonal Bank to expedite and reduce the cost of payments.

However, there are still questions that need to be resolved, as the technology is still in its early stages. Jordan emphasized the need to address issues such as the feasibility of overnight holding of Swiss franc digital central bank funds, methods of remuneration, and determining eligible financial institutions.

The SNB’s cautious stance aligns with similar sentiments expressed by other financial regulators. In mid-March, Sweden’s central bank, Riksbank, issued a research note cautioning about the potential risks associated with CBDCs, particularly concerning unsynchronized data in offline transactions.

The Riksbank stressed the importance of synchronizing offline transactions with online balances, addressing concerns regarding liquidity risks stemming from shadow wallets and intermediary nodes facilitating connections between offline and online wallets."

Adeyemo highlighted that terrorist groups and other such actors are seeking “new ways to move their resources” in response to efforts to restrict their access to traditional financial systems. He pointed out that over the past year, Iran’s Quds Force — a branch of Iran’s military — utilized crypto to finance militant terrorist groups like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza. Additionally, he mentioned that other state actors, including North Korea and Russia, are also turning to crypto to circumvent sanctions.

The Toncoin (TON) token’s price increased by 10.5% to a record $5.90, an all-time high. As a result, its market cap reached $20.2 billion.

In addition, in March, TON developers announced the distribution of 30 million TON for user participation in ecosystem projects. By April 1, the team began distributing coins to various users.

A similar technology for personal identification was proposed last year by Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project that confirms identity using iris scanning for free distribution of tokens. However, since its launch in July 2023, the project has been investigated in countries such as Germany, France, the U.K., and Kenya for collecting user biometric data."
https://crypto.news/binance-executive-nigeria-money-laundering/,Binance executive denies Nigerian money laundering charges,2024-04-08 15:08:11+00:00,"Naga Avan-Nomayo, Brian Stone","Nigerian authorities arraigned Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan before an Abuja High Court on April 8, where the employee denied allegations and applied for bail.

The senior Binance U.S. executive pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges before a Nigerian Federal High Court in the country’s capital as the government began its case against the cryptocurrency exchange.

Gambaryan’s lawyer argued his client should not be held liable for the actions of Binance Holdings Limited, claiming that prosecutors failed to serve the company properly. On April 3, the crypto firm also “respectfully requested” Gambaryan’s release, stressing that he boasted no decision-making position at the firm.

However, attorneys for Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said constitutional provisions allowed the prosecution of company executives. Justice Emeka Nwite ruled that federal prosecutors were in line with legal conduct and noted that a magistrate court dismissed previous objections to the case.

Following the ruling, Gambaryan was remanded to the Kuje correctional center while the court adjourned until April 18 to decide on his bail request. According to local media Punch, the trial will resume on May 2.

Gambaryan has spent over a month in Nigerian custody after he and a fellow Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, were arrested in late February. Law enforcement detained the duo after government agencies announced a crackdown on the crypto firm for money laundering, tax evasion, and foreign exchange rate manipulation.

Allegations that Binance allowed users to tamper with forex rates seem to have subsided, but Nigerian officials proceeded with other charges. While negotiations continued, Anjarwalla skipped detention and fled the country.

As crypto.news reported, Interpol was engaged over an international arrest warrant for the Binance employee. The company declared its cooperation with local enforcement agencies and has since ceased naira services, including its P2P rail."

https://crypto.news/trader-loses-800k-in-crypto-to-malicious-google-chrome-extension/,Trader loses $800k in crypto to malicious Google Chrome extension,2024-04-08 11:39:39+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","Two malicious Google Chrome browser extensions allegedly drained $800,000 from a cryptocurrency investor going by the moniker “Sell When Over” on X.

In a series of posts on X, the user speculated that the malicious extensions dubbed “Sync test BETA (colorful)” and “Simple Game” possibly contained Keyloggers that target specific wallet extension apps.



Keyloggers are malicious applications used by cyber criminals to record every keystroke of a target’s computer. This allows the attackers to access confidential information from a victim’s computer.

According to the user, the issue initially surfaced after Google Chrome released an update last month. The user, who had been delaying the Chrome update, was forced to restart their computer after Windows released a PC update.

Interestingly, following the restart, which is a common step when installing operating system updates, all of the user’s extensions on Chrome were logged out, and all their tabs were gone. This forced the user to re-enter all their credentials on Chrome, along with their seed phrases for their cryptocurrency wallets.

The user speculates that this is when their confidential information was compromised via the keylogger. The funds were reportedly drained three weeks after this event. Further, the user did not notice any unusual activity in their browser following the restart.

“I checked my virus scanner and there were no issues. No additional weird extensions appeared. I proceeded to re-import my seed phrases,” the user wrote.

It was only during a later investigation that the user discovered the two malicious extensions on their system. Further, their browser also had Google Translate set up to auto-translate to Korean.

As of the latest update, the attackers reportedly sent the funds to two exchanges, the Singapore-based MEXC exchange and the Cayman Islands-headquartered Gate.io.

While the user remained unsure how exactly their Chrome browser was compromised, their analysis confirmed that the Sync test BETA (colorful) extension was a keylogger. The extension was reportedly sending data to an external website’s PHP script. The attacker’s website, when opened manually, shows a blank page with only “Hi” written on it. Meanwhile, the “Simple game” extension was “checking if tabs are updated/open/closed/refreshed,” the user added.

“This is a $800k costly mistake — lesson is if anything seems off such that it prompts you to input a seed, then wipe the whole PC first,” Sell When Over wrote.

At the time of publication, neither of the extensions showed up on the Chrome Web store.

Malicious extensions on Google Chrome have been plaguing the cryptocurrency sector for years. In a 2023 report, cybersecurity researchers revealed that hackers were employing a chrome malware dubbed Rilide to steal sensitive data and cryptocurrency from unsuspecting victims. The malware was used to deploy rouge browser extensions capable of draining crypto funds.

As previously reported by Crypto.news, another piece of Windows malware was discovered in late 2022. It used Google Chrome extensions to steal cryptocurrencies and clipboard data. The extensions could edit HTML on websites to display the actual user funds in a wallet while draining the wallet in the background."

The Coinbase executive noted that over the past six months Robinhood’s Btcoin holdings increased by approximately 14%, increasing its share on the market.

Grogan also pointed out that over the past six months, Robinhood’s users decreased their holdings in Ethereum (ETH), with the company’s reserves of ETH declining by 9% over the same period.

Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin has experienced over a 70% increase in value, reaching a new all-time high of $73,750 in March. In contrast, Ethereum’s returns have been more modest, with a surge of only 58% and failing to reach its previous high of $4,890 set in late 2021.

In February, Bitcoin benefited from the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which was granted in late January.

Subsequent inquiries revealed that the phishing advertisements on Etherscan were also replicated across multiple well-known phishing websites.

Following McBiblets’ lead, web3 anti-scam platform Scam Sniffer discovered that the phishing advertising had extended beyond Etherscan, appearing on key search engines such as Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, as well as social media platform X.

Scam Sniffer suspects that the large-scale phishing campaign was caused by a lack of control by advertisement aggregators:

“Etherscan aggregates ads from platforms like Coinzilla and Persona, where insufficient filtering could lead to exposure to phishing attempts.”

The wallet drainer fraud involves attracting users to phony websites and asking them to attach their cryptocurrency wallets. Once linked, the scammer can withdraw funds to their personal wallet addresses without the user’s verification or authorization.

SlowMist’s principal information security officer, 23pds, also issued a warning regarding the phishing adverts on Etherscan:

“Be careful, there are phishing ads on etherscan.”

The infamous and experienced cyber phishing company Angel Drainer is suspected of leading the continuing phishing attack campaign against Etherscan users. However, no substantial evidence of the scammers’ identities has been discovered as of the time of writing.

Meanwhile, the current phishing advisory comes as the industry grapples with a rising number of phishing schemes aimed at it.

According to Scam Sniffer data, phishing attacks scammed around 97,000 crypto users of $104 million in the first few months of this year. Losses were $55 million in January, with $46.8 million coming in February.

Ethereum users suffered the most damage, losing $78 million in assets, including ETH and ERC20 tokens, according to a breakdown of the attacks.

The primary tactic used by cybercriminals was to trick victims into signing harmful phishing signatures like “Uniswap Permit2” and “increaseAllowance,” which allowed the malicious players to acquire unauthorized access to their victims’ cash.

“Most of the thefts of all ERC20 tokens were due to assets being stolen as a result of signing phishing signatures such as Permit, IncreaseAllowance, and Uniswap Permit2,” Sniffer explained in a statement.

Scam Sniffer discovered that the majority of victims were duped by false comments on social media platforms, particularly X.

The attackers frequently pose as respectable cryptocurrency organizations in order to attract unwary people to phishing sites where their digital assets are stolen."

Scaling of Russia‘s digital ruble following the pilot project is anticipated no earlier than 2025, with the transition to mass usage expected to take five to seven years, The Moscow Times reports, citing Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina.

Speaking on the matter, Nabiullina emphasized that the timeline for scaling would hinge on the outcomes of the ongoing pilot project. She underscored that regardless of the project’s results, substantial scaling would not occur before the mentioned timeframe.

“We plan to expand the pilot project on the digital ruble, and based on its results, we will determine the timelines for serious scaling of the digital ruble. However, in our view, this will not happen before 2025.” Elvira Nabiullina

Nabiullina added that widespread implementation of the digital ruble will likely take five to seven years, noting that it will be a “natural process because the choice of people and businesses is crucial, and it must be convenient for them.”

As crypto.news reported earlier, the Bank of Russia considers the digital version of the ruble as an addition to its current set of payment methods: the Faster Payments System, the country’s Mir payment cards, QR code/NFC payments, biometrics-based payments, and cash. The Bank of Russia reassured citizens that the digital currency will be used “alongside individuals’ and businesses’ cash rubles” and is not meant to replace cash.

https://crypto.news/matic-mvrv-ratio-flashes-rare-buy-signal-amid-push-toward-1/,MATIC MVRV ratio flashes rare buy signal amid push toward $1,2024-04-08 10:23:07+00:00,"Wahid Pessarlay, Dorian Batycka","Market data suggests Polygon (MATIC) may be poised for an impending price resurgence, as its 30-day MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio flashes an unusual buy signal.

Wise Advice, a crypto analyst, called attention to this metric, citing data presented by market veteran Ali Martinez. Notably, the MVRV ratio compares an asset’s market value to its realized value in an attempt to assess if the asset’s price is overvalued or undervalued.

The ratio recently dropped to the negative territory, suggesting that MATIC has slipped to the undervalued zone, and is primed for a rebound. Wise Advice emphasized that the last two times the MVRV ratio dropped to this level, MATIC saw substantial price surges.

The metric slipped to undervalued territories in August 2023, when Polygon’s price dropped to the $0.5 threshold. Shortly after this descent, the crypto asset attempted a recovery push but faced resistance at the 50-day EMA ($0.648), leading to another slump.

However, after reaching a floor of $0.493 in September 2023, MATIC embarked on a bullish rally, surging to a high of $0.983 on Nov. 14, 2023. Nonetheless, the MVRV ratio dropped again when Polygon fell from the $0.983 high, eventually re-entering the undervalued zone in January this year.

Expectedly, the decline in the MVRV ratio preceded another impressive price rally from MATIC, with the token breaching the $1 threshold on Feb. 18 for the first time in over a month. Polygon extended the upsurge beyond this point, clinching a 12-month high of $1.290 on March 13.

The latest market-wide retracement triggered a drop from this high, resulting in a subsequent decline in the MVRV ratio. Consequently, the ratio has now hit a low of -12.13, with its seven-day average value sitting at -11.35.

Citing historical data, Wise Advice expects a rebound in MATIC’s price, which currently hovers at the $0.9 territory. The asset is already showing signs of a recovery as the broader market looks to recoup the recent losses. Since dropping to $0.860 on April 5, Polygon has recorded two consecutive days of gains.

MATIC is up 1.75% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $0.928 at the time of writing. The crypto asset would need to breach the crucial resistance levels at the 200-day EMA ($0.965) and the 50-day EMA ($0.984) to record a rally above the $1 price territory."

At the time of writing, FARM had a 24-hour trading volume of $218 million, which was up by a massive 19000%. The recent price action left the token’s market cap at $60 million.

FARM 24-hour price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap

Harvest Finance is a yield farming protocol that shifts user funds across multiple defi platforms to generate returns. It is native to the Ethereum blockchain and can also be traded as a BEP-20 token on the BNB Smart Chain.

FARM reached an all-time high on its first day of trading on Sep. 2, 2020, most likely because it began with a circulating quantity of 0 tokens and the few coins that entered circulation shortly after rocketed to high values. Crypto price aggregator CoinMarketCap records FARM’s all-time high as $2,236.

While data providers dispute the all-time high, all aggregators agree that FARM’s price dropped to around $78 a few weeks after its debut, just as the “defi summer” of 2020 was coming to an end.

During the second wave of the 2021 crypto bubble, FARM reached highs of approximately $303. However, as the second wave subsided around the end of the year, FARM tanked. Things became worse when an October 2020 hack took $24 million from Harvest Finance, causing FARM to drop by 65% in just one hour. The spiral lasted through 2022. By May 2022, FARM had reached a low of $33.35.

The protocol hard-coded a maximum supply of 5 million coins. In the fifth week following its launch, investors voted to limit the supply to 690,420 by reducing the number of tokens generated by 4.45% each week until the end of August 2024.

Even so, according to crypto price tracker Messari, the supply of FARM is growing quickly, going from roughly 250,000 in October 2020 to about 456,000 in January 2021. As a result, the project’s market capitalization reached its peak much later than the cost of any one FARM token, peaking at $194 million in February 2021.

A capped maximum supply is consistent with scarcity concepts, potentially increasing FARM’s value as demand develops.

Harvest Finance issues new tokens on a weekly basis. From this issuance, 70% is allocated to liquidity providers and individuals contributing capital to the platform’s asset management strategies.

A further 10% is directed towards ongoing protocol development, while the remaining 20% is placed into a development fund. The fund is periodically utilized to remunerate the developers responsible for building the protocol."

https://crypto.news/dogecoin-surges-mysterious-wallet-transaction/,Dogecoin surges on heels of mysterious wallet transaction,2024-04-07 16:32:03+00:00,"Julius Mutunkei, Anthony Patrick","The price of dog-themed meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) shot up 10.1% to go above the $0.20 mark over the past 24 hours.

The meme coin has been on an upward trend in the last couple of days, gaining 7% on April 6 to surpass $0.18 after a period of stability earlier in the week.

Analysts attributed the surge to a substantial movement of 200 million Dogecoins from Robinhood to an undisclosed wallet. It sparked discussions in the crypto community about its potential to reach the coveted $1 milestone.

The movement of DOGE, totaling around $35.45 million, was detected by Whale Alert. It involved two transactions carried out within 24 hours.

Dogecoin resurgence

Initially, the mysterious wallet moved 100 million DOGE worth $17.77 million from Robinhood, followed by another transaction of 99.27 million meme coins valued at $17.68 million from the same platform. This activity pushed DOGE’s price up by more than 7% to reach $0.196.

Currently, DOGE is trading at $0.2003, reflecting a more than 10% increase in the past 24 hours and an 18.7% uptick over the last 30 days.

Its price over the last fortnight was also in the green, registering nearly 15% growth. However, over the previous seven days, the meme coin’s performance was a tad lackluster, losing 3.9% of its value, according to CoinGecko.

Alongside the whale transactions, several bullish metrics have also contributed to this price jump, including a 31.95% rise in trading volume over the previous day to $2.23 billion, indicating increased market activity and interest in DOGE.

Additionally, data from CoinGlass indicates that open interest in Dogecoin has grown by 17.5% to $1.67 billion. Notably, a substantial portion of this interest, $553.17 million, is held on Binance, followed by Bybit with $435.19 million and BingX with $216.98 million.

https://crypto.news/top-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-ckb-w-pendle/,"Top cryptocurrencies to watch this week: CKB, W, PENDLE",2024-04-07 14:48:49+00:00,"Wahid Pessarlay, Anthony Patrick","Among the top cryptocurrencies to watch in the days ahead are Nervos Network (CKB) and PENDLE, which surpassed multiple resistance levels. In contrast, Wormhole (W) experienced a price decline shortly after its debut.

Despite the price increases observed in select cryptocurrencies, the broader market saw a marginal downturn. The global crypto market cap shed over $111 billion this week, bringing its valuation to $2.55 trillion at last check.

Here is an overview of the performance from some of the top cryptocurrencies throughout the week:

CKB, W and PENDLE prices – April 7 | Source: Santiment

CKB hits 28-month high

Although Nervos Network benefited from the broader market upswing between October 2023 and March 2024, its gains were insufficient to surpass the highs achieved during the previous bull run in 2021.

Despite the market’s recent slowdown, CKB seeks to reclaim its previous highs. Initially affected by bearish pressure, the token experienced a notable decline of 19.13% on April 1 and 2, resulting in its value dropping to a two-week low of $0.0164.

Nervos Network looked to recoup the losses in the subsequent days, but encountered resistance at the 50-day EMA ($0.01689). Nonetheless, on April 6, the token’s recovery gained traction, allowing it to surpass the 50-day EMA and pursue higher grounds.

On April 6, CKB achieved an intraday gain of 32%, representing its most significant intraday increase in over a month. The cryptocurrency has maintained its upward trajectory, currently up 4.43% today at the time of reporting. Earlier today, CKB surged to a 28-month high of $0.0268 before experiencing a slight decline.

This marks the asset’s endeavor to surpass the November 2021 high at $0.03567. Nervos Network has experienced a 314% increase year-to-date, with a notable 28% surge this month alone. Currently valued at $0.0261, the token has rallied by 39% this week, positioning it as one of the top performers within this timeframe.

W down 21% since launch

Cross-chain protocol Wormhole launched its governance token W on April 3, but a series of selloffs from early investors resulted in a price drop. W initially surged from $1.35 to $1.50 shortly after its debut, commanding a massive volume of $781 million due to listings on multiple exchanges.

However, the crypto asset recorded declines after hitting the $1.50 high, dropping to a low of $1.17 on April 4, as volume spiked to $1.35 billion. This was due to a massive number of profit-taking trades executed by market participants who looked to cash in on the initial rise.

The asset consolidated for most of April 4, but saw another round of declines the next day as the selloffs resumed. W eventually dropped below the $1 mark on April 5, hitting an all-time low of $0.9247. Nonetheless, the asset experienced a recovery from this price floor.

Since then, Wormhole has demonstrated resilience, hedging against any further drops below the $1 price. The asset currently trades for $1.06, but despite its newfound strength, it is now down 21.4% from the initial trading price, with a current market cap of $1.903 billion.

PENDLE clinches new ATH

PENDLE was one of the top performers this week, leveraging the short period of recovery in the broader market to hit record highs. The asset first witnessed three consecutive days of intraday losses from April 1 to 3, dropping 12% to a low of $4.64.

However, as Bitcoin (BTC) and the rest of the market entered a recovery phase on April 4, PENDLE took advantage of the uptrend to record unique gains.

The team behind the project announced the introduction of two new LRTs on Arbitrum on April 4, contributing to the price gains.

Pendle eventually closed April 4 with a massive 28.56% increase, representing its biggest intraday gain this year.

Interestingly, PENDLE, like Bitcoin, has also slipped into a price discovery phase, hitting new ATHs amid the current uptrend. The latest ATH was attained on April 6 as the token surged to $7.21.

PENDLE is now down 8.9% from this ATH, but it has retained most of the gains captured throughout the week.

At its current price, the asset is up 19% this week, now boasting a market cap of $636 million. The asset is up 455% this year."

Wood expressed the sentiment in a dialogue at the latest edition of the Hong Kong Web3 Festival, where she spoke on several key topics shaping the future of the blockchain and crypto industries.

Cathie Wood believes that Hong Kong has very good regulations on cryptocurrencies, providing a comprehensive framework. She thinks that the United States should follow suit, as there is currently regulatory uncertainty and a loss of talent. She still maintains her prediction that… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 7, 2024

During the conversation, she praised Hong Kong’s progressive policies, especially in fostering a conducive environment for crypto, contrasting the special administrative region’s swift responses to market demands with the regulatory uncertainties faced by the U.S.

She especially singled out Hong Kong’s regulatory agencies for their effective management structure in facilitating the trading of virtual assets and commended the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) for providing comprehensive regulatory frameworks and mechanisms for institutional supervision.

Wood acknowledged Hong Kong’s rapid development compared to the U.S., particularly in terms of policy leadership and support for innovative technology and entrepreneurship.

Wood suggests that the U.S. could learn from Hong Kong on how to address regulatory uncertainties and support blockchain practitioners better.

She termed the recent approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a historic milestone, which has led to increased efforts in marketing, investor education, and training.

Wood also noted that many U.S. customers are now recognizing the investment potential across virtual assets, with growing institutional and investor interest in allocating funds to these areas for hedging purposes.

While acknowledging the risks associated with Bitcoin, including volatility in bull and bear markets, Woods maintained that the cryptocurrency’s price could rise to $1.5 million by 2030, partly attributing this projection to the adoption of Bitcoin spot ETFs.

Wood also emphasized the impact of web3 on various sectors, highlighting the potential for cross-border innovation and widespread accessibility. She also remarked on AI integration into blockchain technology, saying she foresees significant advancements in certain areas (i.e., gaming and crypto assets), citing examples like Sony’s investment in games and Polygon’s initiatives in blockchain."

The Hong Kong-based virtual bank confirmed on April 5 that it is opening up security for fiat reserves, which issuers can use to back digital assets.

Additionally, banking services such as fund transfers, payroll administration, and a variety of deposit options will be available to issuers of stablecoins.

ZA Bank alternate chief executive Devon Sin stated that the bank has “unwavering support” for the web3 community:

“With these new services, we’re directly addressing the unique challenges faced by stablecoin issuers, ultimately promoting growth and stability within the web3 economy,” Sin said.

To ensure stablecoins retain their value, issuers must hold a corresponding amount of fiat currency, like dollars, in secure reserves. This guarantees that stablecoin holders can redeem their digital assets for the same value in the underlying fiat currency.

Nonetheless, stablecoin issuers have encountered difficulties in securely administering these reserves. This has impeded widespread adoption and created a significant void across the web3 community.

ZA Bank has made a concerted effort to participate in the rapidly expanding web3 scene in Hong Kong. It reported an excess of $1 billion in client transfer volume in the web3 sector in 2023.

Following the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission’s (SFC) announcement to accept license applications for retail virtual asset trading platforms (VATP) in May 2023, ZA Bank revealed its plans to offer retail virtual asset trading services in Hong Kong.

Since then, the bank reportedly fulfilled over 80% of the VATP in Hong Kong’s client banking requirements. Additionally, it stated that it had recruited over a hundred web3 companies as part of its drive for local adoption.

Stablecoin issuers will be required to obtain licenses, the Hong Kong government announced in December 2023, according to a consultation document from the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

In order to qualify for such a license, the issuer must guarantee the complete support of all circulating stablecoins with reserves that are “at least equal to the par value.”"

In the latest interview with CNBC, the former White House Communications Director expressed his optimism about the Bitcoin market.

Scaramucci pointed out that Bitcoin ETFs reached over $10 billion in cumulative inflow within just three months, a feat that took Gold ETFs a year to achieve.

The USD has lost nearly 22% of its value since January 2020, Scaramucci says, citing how Bitcoin increased over 800%. The top cryptocurrency suffered extreme volatility throughout this period. However, for long-term holders, BTC returned significant profits.

Scaramucci sees the largest cryptocurrency as a long-term asset rather than a short-term inflation hedge.

Bitcoin, as a technical asset, could reach at least half the valuation of the gold market, Scaramucci said, adding that it could potentially end this cycle at $170,000.

Scaramucci also discussed Sam Bankman-Fried’s recent sentencing. The venture capital unit of Bankman-Fried’s FTX acquired a 30% stake in SkyBridge back in September 2022.

FTX went bankrupt that November.

Scaramucci expressed sadness for Bankman-Fried, given his potential and his mental condition. However, he thought the 25-year sentence was light.

He also emphasized that Bankman-Fried should have pled guilty before the trial."

“The short version is: significant progress has been made to overcome the current congestion challenges, and we expect to begin releasing fixes next week,” the Solana-focused software development firm confirmed. “In collaboration with other core contributors, we have analyzed the root cause, and evaluated several potential changes.”

The latest development comes in the wake of Solana network congestion incidents, marking the second such occurrence within a 48-hour span that has led to transaction delays and failures for Solana users.

Anza, on Friday, April 5, blamed the cause of the congestion on a combination of QUIC implementation issues and the behavior of the Agave validator client.

The short version is: significant progress has been made to overcome the current congestion challenges, and we… — Anza (@anza_xyz) April 5, 2024

Anza engineers, along with other core contributors, are making concerted efforts to diagnose and rectify these bottlenecks.

The latest measures are part of a series of improvements that are expected to unfold over the coming months to boost Solana’s network efficiency.

The urgency of the issue was underscored by an alarming trend on April 4, when Solana experienced a failure rate of 75% for all non-vote transactions amid a surge in network activity, as per Dune Analytics. The spike was largely attributed to the growing interest in meme coins on the platform.

The high failure rate has sparked a debate within the Solana community, with many expressing dissatisfaction over the worsening service quality.

Helius CEO Mert Mumtaz, a notable Solana proponent, offered a perspective suggesting that the issue of transaction failures was exacerbated by “bot spam,” rather than an inherent network instability affecting genuine user transactions.

Mumtaz’s claim sheds light on the challenges facing Solana, which have been exacerbated by the blockchain’s popularity, especially in the context of meme coin transactions.

The network’s congestion issues have also caught the attention of Fantom creator Andre Cronje, who has shown support for the Solana network, emphasizing that the current challenges stem from the network’s rapid growth and increased demand for block space.

Seeing a lot of ""I told you so's"" against Solana, because *checks notes* Solana currently has so much demand for blockspace that they need to optimize some bottlenecks (which also btw, is just an engineering hurdle and not a fault of consensus or any critical component).

He characterized these issues as technical hurdles, distinct from flaws in the network’s consensus mechanism, and described Solana as a “victim of its own success.”

This is not the first time Solana has gone down. A notable downtime occurred in early February when its main network stopped processing blocks for more than five hours.

From January 2022, the blockchain has faced roughly six major outages and 15 days with either complete or partial service interruptions.

Anza’s postmortem report of the February outage revealed a bug in Solana’s Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation cache as a contributing factor.

The latest network congestion issues have exerted a negative impact on Solana. The price of SOL has fallen by 10% in the past week and is currently trading around $177.

With this addition, the asset manager’s Bitcoin-based fund now boasts a total of nine APs.

BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF updates

BlackRock, touted as the world’s largest asset manager, now counts Citi, Citadel, Goldman Sachs, and UBS among its APs for its spot Bitcoin ETF offering.

The information was disclosed through an amendment attached to the ETF’s Form S-1 submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 5,

This announcement follows BlackRock and several other firms submitting amended forms for their Bitcoin ETF applications to the SEC.

On Jan. 8, several key players in the financial industry, including BlackRock, Ark Invest/21Shares, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity, and Valkyrie, filed amended S-1 forms for their spot Bitcoin ETFs with the U.S. SEC. This was considered the final step in the approval process.

The submission of amended S-1 forms revealed sponsor fees and strategic adjustments, providing insight into the financial structures supporting these potential spot Bitcoin ETFs.

BlackRock, for instance, set its sponsor fee at 0.3%, with a reduced rate of 0.2% for the first year or until the ETF reaches $5 billion in assets. VanEck chose one of the lowest permanent fees among issuers at 0.25%, while WisdomTree opted for a higher 0.5% fee.

Additionally, ARK Invest and 21Shares announced they would waive their 0.25% fee for the first $1 billion in transactions.

An AP is typically a large bank or investment firm designated by an ETF issuer to issue and redeem shares of exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

APs are pivotal in the ETF market, ensuring liquidity by creating and redeeming ETF shares according to market demand.

This process helps maintain ETF prices closely aligned with the net asset value of the underlying assets. These entities procure the required underlying assets to create ETF shares and receive a package of shares in return, referred to as a creation unit.

BlackRock’s selection of authorized participants for its spot Bitcoin ETF, alongside the surge of amendments to existing spot BTC ETF applications, indicates a notable advancement in the U.S. Bitcoin ETF journey. The forthcoming weeks and months will carry substantial weight in determining the fate of these applications and their potential ramifications on the cryptocurrency market.

SEC seeks feedback for Ethereum ETFs

On April 4, the SEC initiated a public comment phase for three proposed Ethereum spot ETFs, signaling a crucial step in the potential approval process for these offerings.

Grayscale Investments, Fidelity, and Bitwise are each applying for ETF proposals.

Chatter about an Ethereum ETF has gotten louder ever since the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. The move reflects the growing interest in cryptocurrency-based financial products among traditional investment firms.

Despite the optimism surrounding Bitcoin ETF approvals, analysts are not as bullish on the approval of Ethereum ETFs, citing the SEC’s historical resistance to such offerings and the complexity surrounding Ethereum’s classification as a security.

The SEC’s scrutiny of the Ethereum Foundation and Chairman Gary Gensler’s indication that Bitcoin ETF approval did not extend to other crypto assets added to the uncertainty surrounding Ethereum ETF considerations.

While some viewed the potential delay in Ethereum ETF approvals negatively, others saw it as an opportunity for traditional finance to acclimate to Bitcoin, potentially paving the way for smoother adoption of Ethereum-based products.

Stakeholders, including ConsenSys, advocated for the approval and mainstream adoption of Ethereum-based offerings, emphasizing the robust security measures inherent in Ethereum’s design to address regulatory concerns and facilitate the approval process."

The so-called “pig butchering” scheme revolved around a deceptive practice where scammers befriended unsuspecting victims online, and steered them toward investing in cryptocurrencies through fraudulent websites and apps. Afterward, they ultimately blocked them from withdrawing their funds, resulting in total losses of their investments.

#BREAKING: Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez's Virtual Currency Unit disrupted a ""pig butchering"" cryptocurrency scam operation.https://t.co/GCAiByXU4S and 20 associated domains, as well as three servers hosting these sites, have been seized, identifying further victims. pic.twitter.com/dA0cVoQscn — Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez (@BrooklynDA) April 4, 2024

Gonzalez expressed concern over the growing prevalence of such scams, which he described as defrauding residents beyond the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Losses from similar schemes reach billions annually.

He also stressed the importance of public awareness and education as vital defenses against such pervasive scams, urging skepticism towards overly enticing investment opportunities in crypto.

The investigation, led by the Virtual Currency Unit within the DA’s office, stemmed from numerous complaints received by the office, including a case involving a 51-year-old woman who reported a loss of $22,680 after falling victim to a similar scam in March 2023.

She was enticed to invest through chat groups discussing crypto investments, leading to significant deposits and false promises of high returns. However, when attempting to withdraw her funds, she encountered obstacles and ultimately lost her entire investment.

“Investment returns that seem too good to be true are almost always just that – fake,” Gonzalez said. “So, I urge everyone to be very skeptical of anyone who they haven’t met in person and who offers a lucrative investment opportunity in cryptocurrency.”

A detailed analysis of crypto transactions revealed the complexity of the scheme. Gonzalez’s team uncovered a network of domains and servers associated with the fraudulent operation.

The investigation also identified multiple victims from different states, highlighting the far-reaching impact of such scams.

Furthermore, investigators unearthed a network of over 80 domains associated with the scam, with a website known as coinformat.com at its epicenter. Through forensic analysis, the DA’s office identified malicious mobile apps linked to the scam, capable of secretly extracting sensitive user information.

Additionally, the DA highlighted the international nature of these crypto fraud schemes, often facilitated by human trafficking victims in Southeast Asia, stating it poses challenges for localized prosecution and asset recovery efforts.

To combat such scams, Gonzalez’s office seized coinformat.com and 20 related domains, along with three virtual servers hosting these deceptive sites.

The office also initiated a comprehensive public awareness campaign, especially targeting vulnerable communities like the Chinese and Russian populations in Brooklyn, to educate residents about the warning signs and preventive measures against crypto scams.

Gonzalez cautioned against red flags indicative of potential crypto scams, such as unsolicited texts promoting lucrative investments, invitations to join investment groups on messaging platforms, and coercive tactics to download unverified investment apps.

He also advised individuals to research and verify the legitimacy of companies, avoid sharing personal information, and refrain from making investments based solely on online recommendations."

The move, announced in the first monetary policy statement by new Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor John Mushayavanhu, comes as the bank strives to stabilize the country’s monetary system amidst high inflation rates.

Zimbabwe launches new gold-backed currency ZiG https://t.co/tHA72vFzJz — BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) April 5, 2024

The new structured currency, known as Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG), is backed by a combination of foreign exchange reserves and precious metals held by the central bank. This backing aims to ensure the stability and value of the new currency in the market.

The development marks the latest effort by RBZ to tackle Zimbabwe’s currency challenges, following previous attempts such as the introduction of gold-backed digital tokens and bond notes.

Critics derailed Zimbabwe’s gold-backed digital token when it was first introduced last year.

ZiG to bolster Zimbabwe monetary system

According to RBZ governor John Mushayavahu, the ZiG currency will come in various denominations. He also clarified that the multiple currency regime will continue, allowing the new ZiG currency to co-circulate with other foreign currencies.

Local banks will start converting Zimbabwe dollar balances into ZiG, guided by interbank exchange rates and gold prices.

Mushayavahu also stated that the initiative is meant to bolster confidence in the country’s monetary system and provide a more stable alternative for financial transactions.

Some of the central bank’s measures also include a substantial reduction in the annual interest rate from 130% to 20%. This reduction is expected to encourage investment and economic growth by making borrowing more affordable.

While these measures represent a significant shift in Zimbabwe’s monetary landscape, the RBZ assures that the new currency’s stability is supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals and substantial reserve assets, including foreign currency and gold reserves.

While traditional fiat currencies rely on government regulation and central bank policies, structured currencies borrow elements of both fiat and commodity-backed stablecoins.

New policy disrupts financial sector

Meanwhile, Bloomberg reports that the transition to the new currency has led to disruptions in local dollar transactions across financial institutions in Zimbabwe.

Processing of local dollar transactions is on hold until financial institutions adjust to accommodate ZiG. Once this transition is complete, normal banking services are expected to resume.

Several banks, including South Africa’s Nedbank Ltd., have experienced system downtime due to the currency transition, with the process involving reconfiguring systems to align with the new currency’s framework.

The report quoted Zabron Chilakalaka, CEO of ZimSwitch, a key payments platform provider, who described the ongoing changes as a “rebasement” of current balances. While some banks can automate the conversion process, others require vendor support for a smooth transition.

Despite these challenges, U.S. dollar-based transactions continue to be processed seamlessly. The country’s history of currency reforms, notably during the hyperinflation period in 2008, highlights the complexity of such transitions.

The New York bankruptcy court authorized the decision to sell the GBTC shares on Feb. 14, alongside shares from Grayscale Ethereum (ETH) trusts. Genesis initially sought permission when the GBTC shares were valued at nearly $1.4 billion.

Similarly, its shares in Grayscale Ethereum Trust were valued at $165 million, and its Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust shares were valued at $38 million.

These valuations have changed significantly with the recent surge in Bitcoin prices. At the current Bitcoin price of around $68,000, the coins purchased with the proceeds from the GBTC shares alone are now worth nearly $2.2 billion.

The bankrupt crypto lender plans to distribute these coins to its Gemini Earn creditors as part of its repayment strategy. This development follows arguments from the Digital Currency Group (DCG), Genesis’s parent company, regarding the proposed repayment plan, which DCG claims would overpay lenders.

The crypto community’s response to the move has been mixed. While cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase reassured that the sell-off would likely stay within the crypto ecosystem without major market disruptions, concerns linger regarding the potential impact on GBTC and the broader crypto industry.

Genesis’s financial struggles stem from the fallout of the FTX bankruptcy in late 2022, which disrupted its lending operations and pressured it to repay substantial locked deposits. It led Genesis to explore various options, including hiring investment bank Moelis & Co., and announcing a 30% workforce reduction.

The bankruptcy filing affected Genesis and raised questions about the stability of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Market observers were particularly wary of a potential liquidation of over 600,000 Bitcoins linked to the Genesis bankruptcy.

Amidst these challenges, the crypto lender recently settled a lawsuit with New York Attorney General Letitia James over allegations related to its Earn program. The settlement aims to return assets to former Earn customers and other Genesis creditors, pending approval by a bankruptcy judge."

The report, “Banking in Video Games and Virtual Worlds,” highlights the agency’s concerns over scams and diminished consumer protections in video games and virtual worlds. As the intersection of virtual gaming and cryptocurrency grows, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) scrutiny underscores the potential pitfalls facing players in these digital realms.

The CFPB’s findings reveal that despite crypto-metaverses‘ lesser popularity compared to giants like Roblox, Second Life, or Fortnite, these platforms warrant attention due to their ability to facilitate the conversion of virtual assets into fiat currency through third-party trading platforms.

“While these crypto-asset virtual worlds are significantly less popular…they are important to note because of the prevalence of third-party crypto-asset trading platforms,” the agency said in the report.

Today, the CFPB issued a report examining the growth of financial transactions in online video games and virtual worlds. https://t.co/kIFFSY3p5y — consumerfinance.gov (@CFPB) April 4, 2024

Furthermore, the report indicates a growing interest among major virtual gaming world publishers to explore crypto-assets as a means for players to trade virtual items outside the game’s economy, potentially expanding the market’s reach and risk exposure.

In response to the evolving landscape, the CFPB has proposed a rule to tighten oversight of digital financial transactions. The proposed rule, dubbed “Defining Larger Participants of a Market for General-Use Digital Consumer Payment Applications,” seeks to bring larger nonbank companies, including those offering digital wallets and payment applications, under similar regulatory scrutiny as traditional financial institutions. However, critics claim the rule inappropriately claims jurisdiction over crypto.

The CFPB’s report and regulatory efforts come with growing concerns over the security of players’ assets in virtual gaming worlds. Consumers have reported hacking attempts, account theft, and loss of access to in-game assets, often with little support from gaming companies. The situation emphasizes the need for enhanced protections as more financial activities migrate to these digital platforms.

As the CFPB continues to explore its regulatory role in the crypto space, stakeholders like Alexander Grieve, government affairs lead at Paradigm, suggest that such reports could be a precursor to rulemaking, signaling a potential tightening of regulations around virtual economies and digital assets."

FTX’s estate, under bankruptcy administrators led by CEO John J. Ray III, traded 25-to-30 million Solana (SOL) coins well below market prices as the company tried to plug a $16 billion hole left behind by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

According to Bloomberg on April 5, the crypto exchange raised as much as $1.9 billion from its discounted SOL sale from several entities like Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Trading and Pantera Capital. Persons familiar with the matter reportedly said that Galaxy fundraised a $620 million vehicle to scoop Solana from Bankman-Fried’s troubled exchange.

Last month, Pantera also disclosed plans to acquire $250 million of FTX’s SOL, and the estate sold $1.7 million worth of Solana to Nepture Digital Assets.

Filings released last year showed that Solana made up the lion’s share of FTX’s crypto holdings. The FTX founder was a public SOL-supported company that invested hundreds of millions into the native cryptocurrency and tokens within its ecosystem, like Sereum (SRM).

Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison referred to Solana and other SOL-based tokens as ‘Sam’s coins’ during last year’s November trial. Bankman-Fried has since been found guilty on seven criminal counts and sentenced to 25 years behind bars.

“In a situation where it is a matter of competing requests from two states for the extradition of the same person, and not a conflict of requests for the extradition of the same person, as found by the lower courts, the court’s obligation is to determine, in accordance with its powers, whether the legal conditions for extradition are met of the defendant in relation to each petition individually, after which the competent minister, not the court, decides on the permission and order of priority of extradition.” Supreme Court decision on Kwon’s extradition

Ellipsis Labs, the firm behind the Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Phoenix, will inject the funds into advancing its decentralized finance (DeFi) technology stack.

According to the firm, Phoenix is a “top 5 spot dex” across all blockchains in terms of daily volume. The platform holds a total value locked (TVL) of $14.31 million at press time. The trading volume over the past 24 hours was market at $238.79 million.

Per Ellipsis, Phoenix settles trades by eliminating the need for a “crank.” Cranks allow for asynchronous trade settlements, letting blockchains execute multiple transactions simultaneously without having to wait for the transaction finality of a preceding transaction.

“The next step for DeFi must bring the advantages of a decentralized system — accessibility, transparency and auditability — to the liquidity and efficiency that only exists in traditional finance today. Phoenix is only the first step on the long-term path to a better financial system,” the exchange developer said in a statement.

The firm is also expanding its team and has posted job vacancies for engineers to join its New York team.

Meanwhile, venture capital Paradigm isn’t limiting its involvement to Ellipsis Labs. The firm is reportedly looking to raise between $750 and $850 million for a new fund, as reported earlier by Crypto.news.

As the cryptocurrency market saw an impressive start in the first quarter of 2024, VC firms have been getting involved. In the broader market, venture capital firm Multicoin Capital disclosed on April 4 that it led a $225 million funding round in the cross-chain messaging protocol Wormhole last year."

According to data from Dune Analytics, a significant portion of the “non-vote” transactions on the network had failed, the highest ever recorded to date. Per Solana, non-vote transactions refer to SOL transactions within the network.



The surge in failed transactions has drawn in criticism from the cryptocurrency community, with users complaining about the poor user experience.

Memecoins on the Solana network have been a major talking point over the past months. Since the start of the year, countless new meme coin projects have gone live on the network, with some posting massive gains.

The surge in meme coin prices has resulted in trading bots being deployed on the network. These bots aim to make arbitrage trades, and when this arbitrage doesn’t exist, these trades fail.

According to Helis CEO Mert Mumtaz, these failed transactions, which he labeled as “bot spam,” constituted the vast majority of the failed transactions on Solana.

“This is usually not a big problem for users,” Mert wrote in an X post.

“Your wallet will simulate the [transaction] and let you know that it will not work beforehand anyway,” he added.

Mert explained that Dune’s failed transactions chart wasn’t an ideal way of assessing the user impact on the Solana network. “Most users don’t make it there to begin [with],” he continued, adding that most of the spam activity on the network transpires before the scheduling process.

The scheduling process is an operational algorithm within the Solana network that determines the order in which the transactions will be processed on the block. Bots are generally faster than humans when it comes to spamming, and as a result, user transactions are often dropped.

“Bots spam better than humans, so users get the worst end of the stick and get dropped the most,” he wrote.

The CEO also highlighted that since spam activity occurs ahead of the scheduling process, raising transaction priority fees won’t help users trying to execute transactions at the moment. According to him, “increasing [priority fees] above a certain median” will be a “waste” of the user’s money.

“Networking patches are what’s required, and those are rolling out soon,” Mert wrote, adding that the upcoming 1.18 Solana upgrade might not be able to resolve this.

At the time of writing, SOL was down more than 7% over the past 24 hours as the broader sentiment about the token turned bearish. Amidst this backdrop, a Solana-based meme coin project has reportedly scammed users off $906,000 worth of SOL tokens, further adding to the downturn."

Perpetual futures, also known as perpetual swaps or perpetuals, are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to bet on an asset’s future price without a defined expiration date. The regulatory approval process for futures contracts is dependent on the product being sold.

On April 4, Coinbase International Exchange implemented futures contracts for Wormhole’s native W (W) coin, which was released alongside a $850 million airdrop to early cross-chain bridge users.

Meanwhile, on March 21, Coinbase secretly announced plans to market futures contracts for both Litecoin and the memecoin Dogecoin, claiming that it had transcended its origins as an online joke and had established itself as a viable digital currency.

As of March 27, Ethereum had 13.4 million new users, while Polygon had 12.3 million, accounting for roughly 70% of the total number of new EVM users this year. In contrast, Arbitrum has added 4.7 million users since the beginning of 2024.

While Ethereum’s mainnet maintains its historical dominance, Layer-2 protocols are processing more data. Decentralized finance (defi) remains the key attraction for new users, with Ethereum leading in trading volume at $12 billion in Q1.

Furthermore, the upward trend of defi activity contrasted with the previous year’s intermittent, volatile swings, indicating a growing interest and participation in DeFi among novices in the blockchain space.

Arbitrum ranked second on the list, with a $9.5 billion gain since the beginning of 2024. The Flipside report attributes this milestone to increased new user activity in Arbitrum’s defi space. In contrast, Polygon’s high new user numbers are ascribed to an increase in non-fungible token (NFT) activity.

With a record 243,000 new users as of March 16, Base has nearly octupled its new user base since January, owing to Coinbase’s efforts to simplify cryptocurrency for novices.

“While this still puts Base far behind the leading EVM chains in terms of overall new user volume, it nonetheless represents impressive growth, particularly since the chain’s activity waned during the final months of 2023,” the report stated.

The report notes that the surge coincides with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high and represents the highest single-day new user count among EVM chains this year.

Demonstrating diversity, a significant portion of newly registered users interact with an assortment of decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum. However, the analysis found that Ethereum did not have the most evenly distributed app adoption among the six analyzed chains.

“This distinction goes to Base, where the difference in new user volume between the chain’s 1 and 2 apps was only 16.9%, compared to Ethereum’s ~300%.”

“The fact that Base is relatively new likely reduced early protocols’ first mover advantage and consequent network effects, preventing user consolidation around a single app.”

Token swaps and bridging apps are the most typical entrance points for new users on EVM chains, with Uniswap and Orbiter Finance leading the way on Ethereum and Base, respectively.

As revealed by additional insights in the Flipside report, NFT trading activity across EVM chains painted a muddled picture.

New user NFT trading on Ethereum and Base increased steadily, whereas it declined significantly on Polygon from its early peaks; this variation highlights the erratic nature of interest in NFTs and suggests that they may not continue to dominate the market narrative in the upcoming cycle as they had in the past.

Moreover, the report also emphasized the role of specific applications in directing user activity on various chains. For instance, many new Optimism users were lured to Worldcoin (WLD), indicating a long-term community interest in certain projects:

“This remarkable statistic, along with Optimism’s low DeFi and NFT trading volume relative to other observed chains, may reflect a potential divergence between Optimism’s ecosystem evolution relative to other EVM chains.”"

Regarding Runestone NFTs, the exchange informed that those eligible for the Runestone airdrop had received NFTs in their Binance accounts. Nevertheless, holders must withdraw these NFTs by next Wednesday to access any related tokens, utilities, or advantages.

Binance stated that its decision largely came from a willingness to streamline the exchange’s offerings. NFT market data shows that the number of unique buyers and overall trading volume has significantly dropped despite a brief recovery in the fourth quarter of 2023.

The declining market activity and recent criticism of Bitcoin NFTs causing network congestion likely contributed to Binance’s decision."

The lawsuit, filed today, targets the alleged fraudulent distribution of investment and crypto exchange applications through the Google Play Store.

Google says it’s the first tech company to take action against crypto scammers, aiming to establish legal precedents to safeguard its users. The suit accuses the defendants of deceiving Google with false representations about their identity, location, and the nature of the applications uploaded to Google Play.

Google is leveraging the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) law and breach of contract claims against the scammers. The accused reportedly published at least 87 counterfeit apps, misleading users about the legitimacy of their investments.

“This is a unique opportunity for us to use our resources to actually combat bad actors,” said Halimah DeLaine Prado, Google’s general counsel, in a discussion with CNBC Crypto World.

In 2023, the U.S. witnessed crypto fraud losses totaling over $1 billion. Google’s lawsuit seeks to protect users but also aims to deter future fraudulent activities. The defendants, identified as Yunfeng Sun and Hongnam Cheung, allegedly engaged victims through various methods, including text messages via Google Voice, promotional videos on YouTube, and affiliate marketing, since at least 2019.

Applications such as TionRT, a purported crypto exchange, were designed to appear authentic, even allowing initial minor withdrawals to earn users’ trust. However, victims were eventually unable to access their funds, often misled by additional payment requests or minimum balance withdrawal requirements.

The lawsuit highlights that when these fraudulent activities were identified, Google took steps to remove the apps, though the scammers persistently created new ones to circumvent detection.

Google asserts that it has incurred damages exceeding $75,000 due to investigation and safety measures taken against these breaches. The tech giant seeks a permanent injunction to prevent the accused and their associates from accessing Google services and creating accounts."

Specifically, the filing from Bitwise and Grayscale is looking to get listed on NYSE Arca, and Fidelity is eyeing trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange.

Following Bitcoin ETFs’ groundbreaking entry, industry analysts had high hopes for approval. However, optimism has since dried up as the SEC has maintained silence on the matter.

“Asking for public comments on a 19b-4 is standard procedure,” wrote Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart. “Every single 19b-4 ETF filing goes through the same process (whether approved or denied) It’s not “bullish” in any capacity for #Ethereum ETFs.”

ETH analyst Eric Blachunas echoed similar sentiments last month. The Bloomberg analyst estimated the likelihood of sport ETH ETFs being approved to a meager 25%.

Despite its ambitious targets for L2s, VanECK asserted that it remains “generally bearish” about the long-term prospects of some of these networks. The report gauged 46 L2 networks across five key areas and predicted “thousands” of more networks to emerge soon.

“At its core, Ethereum’s primary challenge is its limited capacity to process, store, and compute data in the form of financial transactions. This bottleneck in data throughput is being addressed by offloading much of the data processing and computation to Layer-2 blockchains,” analysts at VanECK wrote in the report.

The analysts estimated that Ethereum has the potential to grab 60% of the market share across all public blockchains. In such a scenario, estimating the volume of the assets within the ethereum ecosystem, the analysts predicted a $1 trillion market cap for L2 networks alone.

“Ethereum’s dominance in smart contracts faces a critical hurdle: scalability. While the network offers unparalleled security and decentralization, transaction fees and processing times soar when usage intensifies,” the analysts continued.

The report stated that development on Ethereum is currently skewed towards enhancing the network’s ability to process L2 transaction data, highlighting the recent Dencun upgrade. The latest Ethereum mainnet soft fork saw L2 transaction fees lowered via the use of a specialized data-saving feature dubbed “Blobs.”

As Such, the analysts concluded that L2 networks are likely to generate “substantially more” revenues than the mainnet. They believe the Ethereum base network cannot “match” the transaction efficiency and user experience of second-layer networks.

However, the analysts remained bearish on the long-term prospects of most of these L2 networks.

“We see cutthroat competition amongst L2s where the network effect is the only moat. As a result, we are generally bearish on the long-term value prospects for the majority of L2 tokens,” they wrote.

They added that just the top seven L2 networks are responsible for a whopping $40 billion in total value locked. This metric is expected to surge as high as $100 billion as several notable projects are about to launch over the next 18 months.

The analysts also envisioned a future dominated by “thousands of use-case-specific” Layer 2 (L2) solutions, with “just a few major players” in the broader market. They also expect a “handful of general-purpose chains,” to gain prominence due to the network effect enhancing their value as more users join.

Further, they highlighted the shift towards the zero-knowledge framework (ZKU), which according to them, is inevitable for most roll-ups due to “its many advantages,” marking a pivotal evolution in the L2 ecosystem.

Per an April 2 analysis report from Glassnode, Bitcoin’s recent rise in price discovery above new all-time highs has tempted holders who were already high into profits to distribute to a fresh investor cohort.

Glassnode employs the Realized Cap metric, which logs the transaction price for each Bitcoin to determine the proportion of holders making a profit or a loss. The metric has reached an all-time high (ATH), indicating a significant market milestone, according to Glassnode.

“This results in spent coins generally being revalued from a lower cost-basis, to a higher one. As these coins change hands, we can also consider this to be an injection of fresh demand and liquidity into the asset class.”

This mechanism is neatly depicted by the Realized Cap statistic, which tracks the total USD liquidity ‘stored’ in the asset or class. The Realized Cap has reached a new ATH value of $540 billion and is growing at an unprecedented rate of more than $79 billion each month.

According to Glassnode, 44% of all BTC in circulation are now held by newer addresses that have been active for less than three months. According to the firm’s statistics, rising above the 44% threshold is generally associated with mid-stage bull markets.

“If we segregate for coin-ages younger than 3 months, we can see a sharp increase over recent months, with these newer investors now owning ~44% of the aggregate network wealth.”

While the market faces intense competition, experts suggest a different landscape compared to previous years, noting that current crypto prices are providing relief to many miners. According to Hub 8 CEO Asher Genoot, the dynamics differ from those seen in 2022, indicating that the current market conditions are supporting miners rather than leading to widespread bankruptcies."

In crypto, exchanges, and wallets are standard tools that nearly every user interacts with at some point. Whether centralized or decentralized exchanges, custodial or non-custodial wallets, these solutions allow participants to trade digital assets.

CoinLedger’s reports focused on centralized exchanges and non-custodial wallets, revealing that Binance was the most used trading venue and users mostly preferred MetaMask for crypto storage.

Ledger wallet, Coinbase wallet, Trust wallet, and Phantom were popular options for safeguarding digital assets, while Coinbase, KuCoin, Crypto.com, and Kraken ranked after Binance.

Jeo Boden (BODEN) is a satirical Solana meme coin that mocks Biden’s public persona and policy views. It features a website showing crude parodies of the U.S. president and heavily utilizes the Comic Sans font in its presentation, incorporating various memes. It also has a Trump-inspired counterpart called Doland Tremp (TREMP).

Launched nearly a month ago, BODEN has surged almost 2,000% since its launch, mainly driven by the buzz around the upcoming U.S. Presidential election and the ongoing meme coin craze on social media.

Like its counterpart TREMP, BODEN seems to rally every time there are any major developments in the U.S. election. Today’s surge is largely attributed to the news of Donald Trump leading Joe Biden in six states, as shown by the latest polls. Biden previously won a majority of the swing states in 2020.

Following this report, the TREMP meme coin also gained over 23% today. The market trends indicate that meme coin enthusiasts will likely continue to bet on these ‘knockoff’ tokens until the U.S. election in November.

The integration allows for transferring assets and data between Ethereum (ETH) and the Cosmos ecosystem, facilitating cross-chain interoperability.

“By connecting Ethereum with Cosmos through IBC and designating Osmosis as the primary liquidity hub, we are setting the stage for a new chapter in DeFi,” stated Henry Love, Executive Director of the Composable Foundation.

The effort aims to enhance the security of bridge operations and expand the possibilities for liquidity and innovation across blockchain networks, which aligns with the team’s goals for 2021.

Osmosis has been selected as the primary destination for Ethereum assets within the Cosmos ecosystem. The choice is based on its role in the Cosmos (ATOM) network as a defi hub, its liquidity pools, defi offerings, and its contribution to the volume of IBC, which includes facilitating over $30 billion in trading volume.

Aaron Kong, Growth & Strategy Lead at Osmosis Labs, highlighted the significance of this integration for user experience and functionality within the defi ecosystem.

The integration aims to promote IBC Everywhere, leveraging the IBC protocol’s capabilities for secure and reliable cross-chain communication. Selecting this approach intends to improve security over centralized bridge solutions and foster collaborations across the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.

In January, the Cosmos Hub community voted to set the ATOM token’s minimum inflation rate at 0% to preserve ATOM’s value by mitigating seller pressure and security overpayments. The vote passed with nearly 95% support.

Previously, the community had capped ATOM’s annual inflation at 10% to maintain its value, which impacted staking profitability. Despite reduced staking yields, validators remained profitable and could adjust transaction fees to cover costs."

“There are currency devaluations taking place that people are not talking about,” Wood remarked in an interview with CNBC, highlighting significant drops in the value of currencies like the Nigerian naira and the Egyptian pound, among others.

Wood added that during these volatile financial times, Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged as a digital asset and a potential safeguard against economic instability. The ARK Invest CEO described Bitcoin as an insurance policy against rogue regimes and horrible fiscal and monetary policies.

Wood’s perspective was further reinforced by the demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., signaling a broader acceptance and integration of this digital currency into the financial mainstream. The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF took the helm on March 28, setting a record $243.5 million daily inflow, further showing the interest and demand for Bitcoin on the institutional level.

Spot Bitcoin ETF impact on BTC halving

Bitcoin prices traded above $66,000 less than three weeks after the token’s fourth halving. This event reduced the amount of new BTC entering circulation and maintained scarcity by tackling coin inflation.

Ryan Lee, Bitget’s Chief Analyst, told crypto.news that this cycle’s halving is especially different primarily due to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and a shift in leading market drivers.

The current trend leans strongly on institutional investors with retail buyers playing a complementary role, while previous bull cycles were driven by VC and retail buyers, The presence of spot Bitcoin ETF is changing the narrative ahead of the BTC halving event this month Ryan Lee, Bitget chief analyst

Pent-up retail demand serviced by these new institutional players has been highlighted as a catalyst for BTC’s run to new all-time highs. The token peaked at around $73,750 per CoinMarketCap, and Lee opined that higher prices may be inbound thanks to the change in halving supply dynamics.

A supply crunch is becoming a reality as Bitcoin balances on an exchange are getting depleted at a fast pace. With a current supply rate of 900 BTC per day, the halving event will reduce this to 450 BTC, deepening the supply scarcity that, in our humble estimation, could push the price of the coin to another new high in the weeks and months following the halving.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), representing 63 central banks worldwide, spearheads numerous projects focused on issuing national digital currencies and leveraging technology to improve market operations.

Tokenization, converting real-world assets into digital tokens, has garnered increasing interest from financial institutions globally. A report endorsed by the U.K. government recently encouraged local businesses to advance their tokenization efforts.

Additionally, HSBC, a leading financial institution, announced last month its venture into tokenizing gold for investors in Hong Kong. Notably, the market value of tokenized U.S. Treasury notes on public blockchains surpassed $1 billion for the first time in March, as per data from 21.co’s Tom Wan.

Project Agorá, named after the Greek term for marketplace, will see collaboration between monetary authorities from the U.K., Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Switzerland, Europe, and the New York Fed alongside private financial firms.

The endeavor investigates how tokenized commercial bank deposits can be effectively integrated with tokenized wholesale central bank money on a public-private programmable core financial platform. According to the announcement, this integration could “enhance the functioning of the monetary system and provide new solutions using smart contracts and programmability while maintaining its two-tier structure.”

Cecilia Skingsley, Head of the BIS Innovation Hub, emphasized the project’s focus on a more efficient payment infrastructure, potentially unifying various payment systems.

“We will not just test the technology, we will test it within the specific operational, regulatory and legal conditions of the participating currencies, together with financial companies operating in them,” Skingsley said.

Local prosecutors obtained a court order compelling the crypto exchange to hand over data and transaction history on all Nigerian users on the crypto exchange. In late March, Anjarwall reportedly escaped from an Abuja guest house and boarded a flight.

A company spokesperson confirmed the news and emphasized collaboration with Nigeria’s government to reach a swift resolution on the matter. Per Reuters, the country has engaged Interpool regarding an international arrest warrant to apprehend Anjarwall while discussion continues over a tax evasion probe.

The two employees also filed a violation against fundamental human rights lawsuit against Nigeria after they were held for over two weeks without charge."

Naved Alam, a 22-year-old resident of Pune, India, saw INR 2.5 lakhs (approximately $3000) worth of his crypto funds disappear after an encounter with his potential employers.

“Sharing my story to raise awareness and prevent others from going through the same ordeal,” said Alam in an X post on March 31.

According to Alam’s post, an X user named ‘crankybugatti’ contacted him regarding a potential role as a product designer in his professional niche.

The employers presented the opportunity related to a web3 communication app dubbed ‘SocialSpectra.’ Following this, Alam was requested to move the conversation to a Discord channel, which, according to him, did not look anything out of the ordinary.

This is when the real scam transpired, as the fake recruiters said they were impressed with Alam’s work and would like to proceed with the HR interview. Alam got a call from an “HR” who forwarded him an onboarding link. According to Alam, the link was supposedly for spyware disguised as an international communication app.

The malware managed to drain Alam’s Phantom wallet and liquidated his staked assets on the Solana-based defi platform Kamino Finance.

“In a matter of moments, I lost $3000 to scammers who prey on unsuspecting individuals looking for legitimate opportunities,” he wrote.

In a statement to a local media outlet, Alam said that he had contacted ‘crankybuggati’ and asked for the money back. The fraudster claimed that he was not a part of the scheme and also pledged to fix the problem by contacting his friend who supposedly works in cybercrime security. Alam said he doesn’t believe this.

The fraudster’s X account was suspended at the time of publication.

Interestingly, the scam transpired as regulators in India have been increasingly cracking down on illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies. Last month, India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a charge sheet against 299 entities under India’s anti-money laundering laws. The charge was in response to investors being duped by fraudsters offering promises of investments in crypto mining ventures.

Meanwhile, on the global front, South Korean authorities recently put an end to a similar scam that cost victims over $4.1 million. According to the allegations, the victims were promised massive profits on cryptocurrency investments."

In a Bloomberg interview on Apr. 2, Simonas Krėpšta, a board member at the Bank of Lithuania, revealed plans for a regulatory overhaul that will substantially decrease the presence of crypto firms in the country, which has positioned itself as a haven for financial technology startups in recent years.

According to Krepsta, Lithuania is now poised to implement stricter licensing requirements, potentially forcing numerous crypto companies to exit the market next year.

“The crypto industry failed in a lightly-regulated environment. We have quite a lot of evidence of that in the US, other European countries but also Lithuania. We saw quite a number of failures, embezzlement cases and similar which were quite a blow for the industry.” Simonas Krepsta

Currently, Lithuania hosts around 580 crypto firms. However, only a fraction of these entities are expected to meet the criteria for obtaining full permits under the new regulatory framework, Krepsta says, adding that the licensing process is expected to come into force by June 2025.

Commenting on the surge of unregulated crypto enterprises in the region, Krepsta acknowledged concerns surrounding potential illicit activities such as money laundering and fraud. However, according to the official, the country is already developing its own legislative framework to govern crypto, enhancing the regulatory oversight capabilities of its local Financial Intelligence Unit."

The Bitcoin market is unlikely to see another cascade of bankruptcies anytime soon, as the whole crypto industry is now operating at a “different scale,” according to Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot.

In an interview with Bloomberg, the head of a Bitcoin mining company noted that the dynamics that exist today “are different than what happened in 2022,” adding that current crypto prices are “bailing a lot of folks out.”

“Back in 2022, a big area that led to a lot of bankruptcies in the mining sector and distressed assets was because of the leverage of 2021.” Asher Genoot

Reflecting on the present state of the Bitcoin market, Genoot highlighted various avenues for companies to sustain themselves, pointing to merger and acquisition opportunities driven by investor interest in the mining sector.

In 2022, many crypto entities like Core Scientific, FTX, and crypto lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy, alongside other mining players such as Compute North and Celsius Mining. Despite these shifts, publicly-traded Bitcoin mining companies continue to face pressure on their shares, as traditional investors no longer consider them as a proxy for accessing Bitcoin.

The partnership introduces a streamlined process for transferring assets between centralized exchange accounts and decentralized finance (defi) wallets directly on the CoinDCX platform.

This feature simplifies the process of digital asset deposits, enabling secure and straightforward transactions without leaving the CoinDCX environment.

“The integration with Mesh is a game-changer for CoinDCX and our users. Solutions like Mesh streamline the complexities of the crypto industry, significantly enhancing the usability factor for our platform.” Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX

Bam Azizi, co-founder and CEO of Mesh, expressed excitement about entering the Indian market through this partnership. He also underlined the potential of the collaboration to streamline digital asset management, considering India’s significance as a dynamic and crucial market.

Established in 2020, Mesh is at the forefront of developing an interconnected and secure financial ecosystem.

By facilitating digital asset transfers, crypto payments, account aggregation, and trading through a single platform, Mesh aims to create an embedded financial ecosystem that benefits both businesses and consumers.

In January, Payments giant Paypal’s venture arm invested $5 million of its PYUSD stablecoin into Mesh.

Mesh serves as a way to move funds between everything from crypto exchanges to wallets to financial apps that support crypto.

The advantage of the service, Azizi said, is that it doesn’t require users to cut and paste a long string of characters—common for crypto transfers—which he describes as a poor security practice. Instead, Mesh users just use an in-app menu.

The latest collaboration of CoinDCX with Mesh could be a response to the increased demand for cryptocurrency exchanges and substantial rises in trading volumes in India.

As earlier reported by crypto.news CoinDCX saw its trading volumes multiply fivefold within the past month, escalating from $5 million at the start of February to approximately $25 million by the end of the month.

Sumit Gupta, the co-founder of CoinDCX, attributed the remarkable growth to the upward trajectory of Bitcoin prices."

A new campaign ETH Evacuations has raised over $55,000 in the past 24 hours for families attempting to leave the Gaza strip. The campaign comes amid news of intensified fighting in the Gaza strip after Hamas-aligned militants stormed into Israel on October 7, leaving hundres of thousands of Palestinians displaced.

The campaign, spear headed by @Katalunia030, who previously worked as the head of product at Zora, a creator-focused platform on the Ethereum network. She initially launched the campaign on March 10, unveiling ethevacuations.xyz to help send donations in ETH directly to families in Gaza.

The campaign quickly picked up pace, with the crypto community actively engaging in helping spread the word. Kat herself has been donating to the campaign and has also been involved with multiple charitable initiatives since her visit to the troubled nation in June 2023.

According to Kat, it costs approximately 1.5 ETH (approximately $5k) for an adult and 0.5 ETH (approximately $2k) for a child to safely cross the Gaza border via the Rafah crossing, the sole crossing point between Egypt and Palestine. Supposedly, anyone crossing via that route needs to pay the “coordination fees.” The campaign funds these expenses

Kat initially began helping her friends and colleagues who were struggling to evacuate. As the donations picked up pace, she extended the campaign to the broader community. By March 13, the campaign was able to safely evacuate two families away from harm.

SlowMist analysts emphasized the need for transparency within DAO operations, noting that the recent significant fund transfers “have raised many questions, particularly regarding the ultimate destination of the funds.”

Javier Milei, who secured the Argentine presidential seat last December, has introduced aggressive economic policies to rescue the country’s collapsing economy and battle the consistent devaluation of the Argentine peso, which is down 99% against the U.S. dollar since 2008.

While Milei’s affinity to Bitcoin has received commendation from the broader crypto community, his stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency appears to be unsettling certain Bitcoin proponents. In a recent post, Max Keiser condemned Milei for conflating Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

This sets his agenda back by years.



Pres. @nayibbukele understands #Bitcoin on a deep level and never made this mistake & passed laws clearly stipulating that everything not BTC is an unregistered security. — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) April 2, 2024

Notably, Bitcoin maximalists such as Keiser believe that Bitcoin is not a part of the crypto ecosystem, contributing to the hostility toward Milei’s unspoken opposing stance. This stance was evidenced in the country’s recent economic policy on cryptocurrencies.

As crypto.news reported on April 2, the Comisión Nacional de Valores, Argentina’s securities regulator, recently introduced a regulation mandating the compulsory registration of all entities regarded as Virtual Assets Services Providers operating in the country.

The new legislation affects all entities providing and receiving crypto-related services such as buying, selling, trading, receiving or sending crypto tokens. With the law also encompassing Bitcoin activities, individuals such as Keiser have condemned the development.

According to Keiser, the Argentine president’s decision to lump Bitcoin with crypto is a “rookie mistake.” He contended that the recent legislation, which identified Bitcoin as part of the crypto ecosystem, has set Milei’s economic reform agenda back by years.

Keiser argued that El Salvador’s president Bukele has a more profound understanding of the Bitcoin agenda than Milei. For context, El Salvador introduced its digital asset issuance legislation last January, which encompasses services related to all digital assets except Bitcoin. Bitfinex secured the first license of operation under the law last April.

The Central American country has unapologetically leaned toward Bitcoin, establishing itself as the first country to make the asset legal tender in 2021. In contrast, despite the failing peso, Milei has yet to adopt this stance. Instead, the Libertarian has hinted at dollarizing the Argentine economy."

“This phase sets the foundation for W’s multichain ambitions, ensuring the token starts strong in one of the most vibrant and rapidly growing crypto ecosystems.” Wormhole

Following the token’s rollout on Solana, Phase 2 will begin, with W set to expand across all Wormhole-connect chains with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), utilizing Wormhole Native Token Transfers (NTT), a framework for transferring tokens across blockchains without liquidity pools. This expansion will enable W transfers across not only Solana, but also Ethereum mainnet, and various layer-2 solutions without liquidity fragmentation, the announcement reads.

However, the project’s team didn’t provide an explanation regarding the timeframe for each phase, leaving it unclear when exactly the Wormhole DAO should be expected to arrive.

Forbes magazine has published a ranking of the world’s wealthiest and most influential cryptocurrency billionaires, headed by Zhao. Forbes estimated his net worth at $33 billion, more than triple what it was in 2023 at $10.5 billion. Zhao’s stake in Binance is about 90%, valued at $32.5 billion.

The Binance founder topped the billionaire ranking despite significant legal problems in the last year. In November 2023, Zhao and Binance pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions regulations.

As part of a sweeping settlement with the government that allows the cryptocurrency exchange to continue operating, Zhao agreed to step down as the exchange’s CEO and pay a fine of $50 million. Binance was forced to pay $4.3 billion per the agreement.

The verdict on charges of money laundering is expected on April 30. Zhao admitted guilt back in the fall of 2023.

“Yet it hardly left a dent in his fortune. His stake in Binance—estimated to be 90%, based on corporate documents and conversations with former employees—is worth some $32.5 billion.” Forbes

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took second place in the ranking, with Forbes estimating his fortune at $11.2 billion. Armstrong’s savings growth is directly related to the company’s position in the market, with Coinbase shares having risen significantly since the beginning of 2023.

According to a Dune Analytics dashboard tracking staking activity, Lido Finance had the highest Ethereum (ETH) outflow among similar protocols in the past month.

The page created by researcher Hildobby indicated that stakers withdrew over 284,800 ETH from Lido’s platform. Nevertheless, Lido retained its dominance over the Ethereum staking sphere with a 29.7% market share.

On-chain data revealed that ETH stakers are flocking to liquid restaking protocols. Lido recorded the largest monthly outflows, while Ether. fi and Renzo Protocol attracted the most significant inflows, at over 400,000 and 280,100 Ether, respectively.

According to DefiLlama, Ether.fi and Renzo are the two largest liquid restaking platforms available. Ether.fi boasts a $3.1 billion total value locked (TVL), and traders have invested north of $2.1 billion into Renzo. Users have locked over $8 billion in these protocols.

Ethereum stakers bet on Eigenlayer points

The shift from Lido into liquid restakers like Ether.fi and Renzo underscores an interest in Eigenlayer points among defi participants. Liquid restaking protocols piggyback off Eigenlayer’s platform to allow stakers to secure other networks and solutions with ETH.

The practice emerged from staking, a defining feature of Ethereum’s blockchain following the Merge in September 2022, the switch from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake. Under the new paradigm, stakers replaced miners as the chief guardians of Ethereum’s chain by locking up ETH with validators to bootstrap security.

Eigenlayer expanded on this initiative by repurposing staked ETH toward a more expansive basket of protocols and chains tied to Ethereum. The protocol rewards participants with points, and the leading thesis suggests that these points may be converted into a token airdrop in the future."

The summary is that layer 3s don't magically improve throughput even more, though they can reduce some fixed costs of batch publishing and deposits/withdrawals. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 2, 2024

Recently, an online debate broke out regarding the usefulness of L3 protocols for the Ethereum ecosystem. Several speakers pointed out the benefits of these solutions.

He attached to the post a link to his article entitled “What kind of layer 3s make sense?” which he published in September 2022. In it, Buterin expressed the opinion that this category of networks is not directly intended for scaling. Instead, such protocols would implement certain “customized features” for layer 2, he suggested at the time.

However, there are other, potentially ""lighter"", ways to get the same cost savings that you get from L3s. pic.twitter.com/WTijiTAOE1 — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 2, 2024

Layer 3 solutions are the general name for protocols deployed on top of existing layer 2 (L2) solutions. As with L2’s, the third layer of networks is designed to scale and expand the functionality of the main blockchain.

The protocol, known for its yield-earning USDe token, is looking to distribute 750 million ENA tokens through an airdrop. The airdrop will see 5% of the token’s total supply flow into the market.

Ethena Labs announced the development via an X post, inviting users to claim the airdrop. Following the announcement, the price of ENA jumped 8%. The token quickly garnered a considerable market cap of over $890 million on Aug. 2, per Coingecko data.

At the core of Ethena’s offering is the USDe token, designed as a “synthetic dollar” that aims to maintain a stable value close to one dollar. It achieves this through a unique blend of ether liquid staking tokens and short ether (ETH) perpetual futures positions.

This strategy has not only attracted individual investors but also caught the eye of institutional players within the cryptocurrency domain.

Stablecoin issuer MakerDAO has revealed plans to allocate 600 million DAI to Ethena’s USDe token. This move will be facilitated through the defi lending protocol Morpho Labs.

“Ethena TVL growth is on track with internal expectations,” said Seraphim Czecker, Ethena’s Head of Growth, after announcing the MakerDAO move.

MakerDAO’s faith in Ethena and USDe stems from an analysis by BA Labs, part of MakerDAO’s advisory council, which observed strong user demand for the stablecoin. The analysis recommended focusing on higher leverage USDe pools, advocating for a more considerable allocation of MakerDAO’s stablecoin DAI in these areas.

Meanwhile, Ethena has also launched a new phase of its airdrop on April 2. Dubbed the “Sats” campaign, it will focus on onboarding BTC as a backing asset for USDe. The project will leverage BTC perpetual futures, giving it access to an additional $25bn of open interest to hedge."

“I never thought that what I was doing was illegal,” SBF said in an interview with ABC News.

The April 1 interview follows the sentencing of SBF by Judge Lewis Kaplan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The March 28 sentencing saw SBF heading to federal prison for 25 years.

The former CEO responded to emails from the media outlet from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.

“I’m haunted, every day, by what was lost. I never intended to hurt anyone or take anyone’s money,” a remorseful SBF said.

Bankman-Fried didn’t shy away from acknowledging that, under his leadership, things took a turn for the worse. He also shared a bit of his current state of mind, revealing a deep-seated desire to fix some of the damages he had dealt.

“I’d give anything to be able to help repair even part of the damage. I’m doing what I can from prison, but it’s deeply frustrating not to be able to do more,” he said.

On the day of his sentencing, Judge Lewis Kaplan had called out SBF for dodging the truth and lacking any real show of regret for his role in one of the crypto world’s biggest failures.

“Not a word of remorse,” Kaplan was noted saying in a statement.

But Bankman-Fried begs to differ. “Of course, I’m remorseful,” he countered just days later, touching on the deep-seated anguish and betrayal felt by countless FTX users.

“They deserve to be paid in full, at current prices,” said SBF, adding that this is what should have happened in November 2022, the month when FTX filed for bankruptcy.

“It’s excruciating to see them waiting, day after day.”

He also alleged that the FTX holds sufficient assets to repay its customers “at current prices or prices at the time.” He blamed the exchange’s decision not to restart the company following his departure.

He didn’t stop there. Bankman-Fried shared the emotional toll of witnessing the fallout among his colleagues and the philanthropical projects he once championed, now tarnished by the scandal.

The plot thickened as SBF took aim at Sullivan & Cromwell, the legal firm representing FTX’s new management. He accused them of bias and alleged their close relationship with prosecutors skewed the fairness of his trial.

“The process was tainted,” he declared, pinpointing the firm’s influence and the media storm it allegedly whipped up as central to his resentment.

Looking ahead, Bankman-Fried revealed plans for an appeal. His strategy includes targeting inaccuracies in the trial testimony, claiming it “greatly misstated” what actually transpired. SBF also criticized constraints placed on his defense, including prohibitions against presenting key evidence and calling vital witnesses."

This move, reported by the HKEJ, seeks to introduce a major advancement in the local digital asset ecosystem and also cement Hong Kong’s position as a leader in the integration of traditional financial systems with blockchain technology.

For the uninitiated, tokenization involves the conversion of the rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. GF Securities’ initiative is a response to the growing global interest in the tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA), which is part of a broader movement toward the digitization of physical assets.

This trend has continued to gain momentum, as it offers investors a more direct way to get involved in the real economy. ABT Tech, a blockchain firm based in Hong Kong, will provide the technical support for this tokenized commercial paper.

Notably, the issuance complies with the regulatory guidelines set forth by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) last November, which established a regulatory framework for such innovative financial instruments in the region.

The use of the Ethereum blockchain as the foundation for this tokenized security introduces multiple benefits, including an opportunity for investors to monitor and manage their investments with greater flexibility and independence from traditional institutional constraints.

In addition, Ethereum facilitates the creation of supplementary tools and integrated management solutions, reducing entry barriers and democratizing investment access. BlackRock leveraged Ethereum for the launch of BUIDL, its latest push into blockchain tokenization.

On a global scale, RWA tokenization is recognized as the next phase of crypto development, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars into the blockchain industry. Interestingly, a report from BCG suggested that tokenized assets are expected to reach a $16 trillion market by 2030.

U.S.-based blockchain payments company Ripple is also looking to secure its spot in the growing tokenization industry, disclosing plans last year to transform the real estate industry through tokenization. The firm was also included in Hong Kong’s move to launch e-HKD, the digital Hong Kong dollar.

Notably, the recent move from GF Securities comes up a few months after BOCI, the investment banking arm of the Bank of China, partnered with UBS to issue tokenized notes on Ethereum in June 2023."

While Munchables narrowly avoided a massive loss, the developer has revealed that it is now implementing a number of modifications to “upgrade the security of the project’s funds and smart contracts.”

We’re on the final steps with the lockdrop refunds.

Munchables said that developers from Manifold Trading and Selini Capital will re-audit and upgrade to new contracts, as well as monitor Munchables’ future dev hiring process.

Nethermind, an Ethereum infrastructure firm, plans to thoroughly audit the revised contracts before Munchables goes live again.

After the game’s relaunch, returning players will be eligible for higher awards. The platform has also promised to provide financial assistance to those involved in the recovery effort.

The announcement coincides with the release of the white paper for BunkerCoin, a blockchain protocol designed for environments with limited bandwidth, including compatibility with shortwave radio.

The white paper, released today and titled “BunkerCoin: A Low Bandwidth, Shortwave Radio-Compatible Blockchain Protocol,” presents a technical overview.

BunkerCoin utilizes a recursive Zero-Knowledge Proof hash function and a proof of elapsed time Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). The VDF allows miners to identify a ‘golden ticket,’ essential for block validation and transaction integrity.

BunkerCoin addresses the challenge of data transmission over shortwave radio by optimizing for a 300-byte Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). This is achieved through erasure-coded frames to ensure data transmission reliability and network robustness in low-bandwidth conditions. The protocol employs a Nakamoto-style longest-chain rule, which works with the transmission and validation methods to maintain network security.

Until further notice of the release of BunkerCoin, users looking to invest in this technology should be aware of “BunkerCoin” like scam coins on popular blockchains, like Solana, Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), and Base. The best case is to wait for an announcement from Yakovenko himself for verification and more information.

By introducing a new protocol, Yakovenko could want to escape the meme coin volatility on Solana, which started in December 2023. The surge in meme coin popularity has led to significant trader profits, driven by the hype and rapid token proliferation on the Solana (SOL) and Base blockchains.

According to Buterin, the roadmap’s new stage aims to simplify the network structure and reduce the load on nodes. Central to developing the protocol at this stage is the implementation and development of EIP-6780, introduced during the recent Dencun hard fork. It optimizes the SELFDESTRUCT opcode, increasing security and simplifying protocol implementation.

A quick note on next steps in Ethereum protocol simplification and node resource load decreases (aka ""the Purge""):https://t.co/BAebCGrisB — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 1, 2024

“This EIP is a key example of an often undervalued part of Ethereum protocol development: the effort to simplify the protocol by removing complexity and adding new security guarantees.” Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder

Buterin outlined several more points within Ethereum to optimize the protocol. Recently, a Geth client removed thousands of lines of code, decluttering network support that had been added before the Merge, while EIP-7523 fixed the “empty accounts” issue.

Thanks to the update, support for most empty accounts from Ethereum proof-of-work (PoW) networks has ceased. Dencun’s 18-day blob storage window also contributed to the protocol’s simplification, limiting the stored information to 50 GB, which stays the same over time.

In addition, Buterin proposed using a precompilation mechanism—these Ethereum contracts which contain logic implemented directly by the clients instead of EVM code.

“Precompiles are used successfully today, notably to enable ZK-SNARK-based applications with the elliptic curve precompiles.” Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder

In March, the Ethereum co-founder drew attention to the need for internal scaling of the network and parallelization of rollup processing to build on the success of the Dencun update. The most significant upgrade since migrating to the proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm due to the Merge implemented the possibility of blob transactions."

Polygon CEO speaks out about L3s

I’ll say the quiet part out loud: L3s exist only to take value away from Ethereum and onto the L2s on which the L3s are built.



*You do not need L3s to scale*



And this is why Polygon Labs does not work on L3s. — Marc Boiron (@0xMarcB) March 31, 2024

Boiron articulated Polygon Labs’ position on April 1, emphasizing that their focus on L2 scaling solutions is driven by a belief in their sufficiency for Ethereum’s (ETH) needs.

“L3s exist only to take value away from Ethereum and onto the L2s on which the L3s are built,” Boiron stated, highlighting a fundamental concern regarding the distribution and retention of value within the blockchain’s layers.

In a clarifying response, Boiron argued against L2 value representing Ethereum value, presenting a hypothetical scenario to highlight the potential risks to Ethereum’s security and value capture mechanisms should L3s consolidate value onto a single L2.

“The objective was to scale Ethereum when nobody else did it,” Boiron said. “L3s are not consistent with that mission.”

Despite Boiron’s skepticism, the dialogue around L3 technologies reflects a broader discourse on scaling and enhancing blockchain ecosystems. Layer-3 protocols, offering solutions for scalability, interoperability, and specialized decentralized applications, are emerging as a dynamic component of the blockchain landscape.

Innovations from entities such as Orbs, Xai, and zkSync Hyperchains exemplify the growing exploration of L3 capabilities, although the sector remains nascent."

Additionally, Bithumb cited the introduction of a fee-free policy in Q4 2023, aimed at stimulating trading volumes, as another contributing factor to the revenue decline. The exchange seems determined to outpace its main rival, Upbit, with its decision to remove trading fees already resulting in a surge in market share from 12% in October 2023 to 40% by February this year.

For Bithumb, maintaining financial stability is extremely important, especially considering its forthcoming plans to go public in the second half of 2025 on South Korea’s KOSDAQ stock exchange. As crypto.news earlier reported, Bithumb’s decision to pursue an initial public offering (IPO) appears to be driven by a desire to bolster investor confidence amid intense competition in the domestic market."

The recent acquisition significantly boosts Tether’s reserves prior to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. With this, the total number of Bitcoins in the stablecoin issuer’s treasury has surpassed 75,000. The Bitcoins were purchased at an average price of $30,305.



Tether’s Bitcoin reserves are now valued at $5.3 billion. Its Bitcoin wallet is also up 128%, with unrealized profits amounting to over $2,94 billion.

Tether has been actively strengthening its Bitcoin reserves since the first quarter of 2023. The firm has also unveiled plans to invest up to 15% of its corporate profits generated from excess USDT reserves in Bitcoin. According to Tether, this will help diversify the stablecoin’s backing assets.

According to data from Bitinfocharts, this acquisition makes Tether the seventh largest Bitcoin holder in the world. At the time of publication, Binance’s cold wallet held the first position, valued at $17.31 billion.

“The decision to invest in Bitcoin, the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset,” Tether CEO Paulo Ardoino has previously said regarding Tether’s strategy to invest in Bitcoin.

“Our investment in Bitcoin is not only a way to enhance the performance of our portfolio, but it is also a method of aligning ourselves with a transformative technology that has the potential to reshape the way we conduct business and live our lives.”

In its Q4 report for 2023, the firm revealed that Bitcoin contributed $2.8 billion to its consolidated reserves. In November 2023, the firm revealed its intention to venture into cryptocurrency mining, with plans to invest in Bitcoin mining facilities. The announcement noted that Tether’s goal is to establish mining operations in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador.

The development follows Tether’s USDT hitting a record market cap of $100 billion on March 4, following a 9% year-to-date growth rate.

Furthermore, Tether also announced on March 26 the launch of its dedicated AI division. The company will develop open-source AI models and collaborate with other firms to incorporate these into commercial offerings."

The large whale movements come as the Solana price falls below the $200 mark in the middle of bearish market sentiment.

SOL is up by 0.14% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $197 at the time of writing. The asset’s market cap stands at $87.6 billion, slightly above BNB’s $87.4 billion market value. Solana’s daily trading volume recorded a 45% surge, reaching $3.1 billion.

Notably, SOL briefly touched a local high of $204 at 01:35 UTC on April 1 for the first time in two weeks.

According to data provided by Santiment, Solana’s total open interest (OI) increased by $120 million over the past day — rising from $2.36 billion to $2.48 billion. Higher OI usually leads to higher price volatility since liquidations could happen at any moment.

The amount of traders betting on a further price hike for SOL has also slipped. Per Santiment, the total funding rate aggregated by Solana fell from 0.06% to 0.05% in the past 24 hours.

This shows that the amount of short trading contracts has slightly increased.

On the other hand, Santiment data shows that the SOL Relative Strength Index (RSI) plunged to 53 for the first time since Feb. 28. The indicator shows that the heat around Solana has cooled down, and the asset could potentially enter another accumulation phase.

For Solana to maintain its bullish momentum, its RSI would need to stay below the 60 mark."

https://crypto.news/defending-decentralization-tron-fights-back-at-sec-lawsuit/,Defending decentralization Tron fights back at SEC lawsuit,2024-04-01 11:18:31+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","Tron Foundation, the organization behind the Layer 1 blockchain network Tron, has asked the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to dismiss a securities lawsuit against the platform.

According to a March 28 dismissal motion, the Tron Foundation has based its case on the grounds that the SEC is not a “worldwide regulator”. The foundation claims that the regulator has gone “too far” with its attempt to apply U.S. securities laws to the “predominantly foreign conduct.”

Tron has stated that the U.S. regulator’s case is against “foreign digital asset offerings” to foreign users on a “global platform.” With the firm headquartered in Singapore, the motion claims that the SEC has no jurisdiction over these matters.

The SEC filed a lawsuit against the Tron Foundation in March 2023. The lawsuit also targeted the firm’s CEO and founder, Justin Sun, the Bittorrent foundation, and Bittorent’s San Francisco-based parent firm, Rainberry Inc., both of which were acquired by Tron.

The regulator alleged that Tron’s TRX token and BitTorrent’s BTT token were securities. As such, the accused is being charged for executing the sales of unregistered securities offerings. This is a trend that has been consistent when it comes to the SEC.

Further in the Motion, Tron alleged that its token sales were executed “entirely overseas” adding that it took additional steps to avoid the U.S. market. It also highlighted that the SEC’s suit doesn’t allege that the tokens were offered or sold “initially” to U.S. residents.

The firm went on to state that the SEC’s claim that the sale is an unregistered securities offering is “tenuous at best.” The foundation further argued that investments would fail classification as investment contracts under the Howey test.

Tron’s suit also touched on the SEC’s claims that Tron founder Justin Sun was engaged in “manipulative wash trading.” The regulator also alleges that Sun secretly paid celebrities like Soulja Boy and Akon to promote the tokens.

In its motion, Tron argued that there is no evidence to show that the trades “were actually ‘wash trades,’ wrongfully executed for illegitimate purposes (much less affecting anyone in the United States).”

“The SEC also does not allege a single victim, Tron wrote in its motion.

The motion also stressed that the SEC failed to provide details regarding factual allegations and each defendant’s role in these claims. It accused the regulator of generalizing and coming to conclusions “to support its already thin, frequently indiscernible claims.”

According to Tron, this vagueness forces both the defendants and the court to “speculate” the foundation of these allegations, thereby questioning the legitimacy of the lawsuit itself.

As such, Tron invoked the major questions doctrine—a legal principle emphasizing that legislative powers rest with Congress, not regulatory agencies—to argue for the lawsuit’s dismissal. Coinbase previously employed this Strategy in its suit against the SEC.

With Tron’s formal request for dismissal filed, the SEC is expected to submit a counter-response in the coming weeks."

Among the prominent mainstream assets, Dogwifhat (WIF), Core (CORE), Jupiter (JUP), Pepe (PEPE), and Floki (FLOKI) distinguished themselves as the standout performers, achieving triple-digit percentage gains.

Here’s how these assets performed:

Top 5 gainers of March 2024 | Source: CoinMarketCap

Dogwifhat (WIF)

Newcomer dogwifhat (WIF), a Solana-based meme coin that launched in November 2023, took the spotlight this month when it recorded bullish momentum to reach impressive price milestones, transforming modest investments into millions.

Dogwifhat’s uptrend began in late February when the cryptocurrency changed hands at the $0.3 price territory. Buoyed by Bitcoin’s rally, WIF eventually breached the $1 price for the first time in its history on March 1, surging to a high of $1.33.

The meme coin sustained its run following this milestone, facing minimal resistance on the journey to a $3.55 high on March 15 despite the rest of the market facing opposition. WIF dropped from $3.55 and retraced some of the gains, consolidating at $2 until March 24, when it resumed the uptrend.

The resumption persisted until the end of the month, allowing WIF to close March above $4 despite starting the month below $0.4. CoinMarketCap data indicates that dogwifhat rallied 362% this month, making it the best performer among the top 100 assets.

Core (CORE)

Core launched last February but immediately collapsed after public trading started due to massive selloffs. The asset failed to recover from this drop despite the upward momentum in the market, which began in October 2023.

The months of January and February also saw a disappointing underperformance from CORE, with the downtrend extending to March, as the token declined to $0.56 on March 22. Core’s uptrend for March began in the latter part of the month when it staged a recovery from the $0.56 low.

The token surged 167% from $0.56 on March 22 to a high of $1.5 on March 30. However, most of the gains recorded by CORE came up on March 31, as the cryptocurrency ended the day with a massive 86% gain, with a closing price of $2.59. CORE soared 299% last month, representing the third-largest gains for a top 100 asset.

Jupiter (JUP)

Jupiter, the native token of the Solana-based DEX aggregator of the same, has had a stellar year since its debut in January. Following a spike to $0.6, JUP consolidated for most of the year until March, when it started recording mild price rallies.

This gradual but steady uptrend throughout March allowed JUP to reach $0.98 by March 14, as $1 beckoned. An impressive 27% increase on March 15 saw the crypto asset hit a high of $1.2. Jupiter faced resistance after soaring further to $1.61 on March 18, leading to consolidation.

The cryptocurrency broke above the consolidation phase as the month came to a close, ending the month above the $1.7 psychological mark. Jupiter is the fourth-biggest gainer among the top 100 assets in the last 30 months, up 192% within this timeframe. The asset has also surged 38% in a week.

Pepe (PEPE)

Pepe, the second meme coin on this list, has continued to garner investor interest. The uptrend recorded by Pepe this month marked the second time the cryptocurrency dominated social trends, commanding considerably high trading volumes.

Pepe’s uptrend lasted for 19 days, allowing the asset to clinch a new all-time high of $0.00001084 on March 14. This represented an 810% spike from the $0.00000119 price the meme coin saw on Feb. 24. Like the rest of the market, PEPE dropped after hitting the $0.00001084 high.

Having relinquished the $0.00001 psychological territory to the bears, the cryptocurrency is currently consolidating at the $0.000008 level. Pepe is down 2.54% over the last 24 hours, but maintains a 151% increase in the past month, enough to secure a spot among the top 5 gainers.

Floki (FLOKI)

Floki has managed to seal a spot among the top 5 gainers for this month, witnessing a price trajectory similar to Pepe’s. Both assets recorded most of their gains during the meme coin mania from late February to early March.

Floki’s initial rally saw it reclaim a high of $0.0001742 on March 4. The meme coin retraced and consolidated for three days before resuming the uptrend, with a push toward the all-time high of $0.00031387 on March 14. A pullback from this peak saw FLOKI decline to $0.00016.

The cryptocurrency summarily recovered from this correction. Despite facing an upheaval in its attempt to reclaim the $0.0003 high, Floki has retained most of its gains for March, closing the month with an impressive 302% increase to become the second-largest gainer in the past 30 days."

According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, Zverev acts as an intermediary for Russian entities, employing Tether for transactions involving substantial sums. For instance, he facilitated a multi-million dollar transfer from Kalashnikov Concern, Russia’s largest producer of small arms, to an electronics vendor based in Hong Kong.

Communications revealed on Telegram show Zverev’s strategy of converting rubles into Tether to remit payments to overseas suppliers, primarily in China and the Middle East. This approach has enabled Russian businesses to persist in their operations despite the sanctions.

The U.S. Treasury Department is advocating for new legislative measures to permit the blocking of transactions involving U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins such as Tether. Following these concerns, the department recently sanctioned a Moscow-based firm for its reliance on Tether for payments.

Brian Nelson, the Treasury’s Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, remarked, “Russia’s adoption of alternative payment methods to bypass U.S. sanctions facilitates the continuation of its military engagement in Ukraine.”

The manipulation of cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and support illegal activities is a global issue. North Korea, for instance, has amassed billions in cryptocurrency to bolster its weapons program, prompting calls from the UN for tighter control over crypto transactions.

Concurrently, Russia is striving to position itself as a key player in the international cryptocurrency space, announcing initiatives to launch a new global currency, encourage mining operations, and ease cross-border crypto transactions.

After the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, western countries initiated a strict sanctions regime against Russia, highlighting the urgency of addressing the misuse of digital currencies.

The backdrop of heightened scrutiny led the U.S. Treasury Department to take decisive action. In March, the department expanded its sanctions list to specifically target 13 companies and two individuals deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency trading space.

Meanwhile, the broader implications of cryptocurrencies being exploited for illicit purposes have not gone unnoticed. Among those voicing concerns is Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who has suggested the adoption of “privacy pools” as a strategy to improve the cryptocurrency market’s transparency and reliability. The proposal aims to eliminate dishonest traders from the crypto space."

PeckShield’s analysis identified Munchables as the project most affected by stolen value in March. As crypto.news reported, a team member associated with North Korea allegedly pilfered over $60 million in crypto from the project before returning the funds after their identity was revealed.

Despite the decline in losses compared to February, March’s figures still exceeded those of January, during which the market encountered $182.5 million in losses, according to PeckShield.

https://crypto.news/argentina-introduces-mandatory-crypto-exchange-registry-amid-regulatory-shift/,Argentina introduces mandatory crypto exchange registry amid regulatory shift,2024-04-01 08:42:54+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","Argentina has launched a mandatory registry for Bitcoin and crypto exchanges, a move announced by the country’s securities regulator Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV), to better oversee the cryptocurrency industry.

The directive mandates that any entity involved in buying, selling, sending, receiving, lending, or trading cryptocurrencies must register with relevant authorities. The requirement applies both to companies based in Argentina and those operating within its market from abroad.

The development follows the election of the anarcho-capitalist and libertarian leader, Javier Milei, who assumed office in December 2023, with initial expectations that his administration would promote the adoption of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in Argentina.

However, contrary to these expectations, the government has moved to introduce more stringent regulations for the crypto space.

In late March, the Argentine Senate approved amendments to the country’s regulatory framework to include this new registration requirement, aiming to align with the Financial Action Task Force’s recommendations.

Roberto E. Silva, the president of the CNV, emphasized the importance of compliance, stating, “Those who are not registered will not be able to operate in the country.”

Following the announcement, the CNV held a meeting with major legal firms and the Fintech chamber to discuss the registry’s implementation, with several local company representatives in attendance.

The decision has ignited a mix of reactions across the crypto community, with concerns about the implications for the market’s dynamism and innovation.

Manuel Ferrari, a member of an Argentinian NGO directive and co-founder of the Money On Chain protocol, criticized the registry, arguing that it misconstrues the nature of Bitcoin and could unnecessarily burden the industry with regulation.

In an interview with Forbes’ Bitcoin researcher and writer Javier Bastardo, Ferrari expressed his view that such a registry is as misguided as requiring currency exchange houses or gold traders to register with the CNV, calling it “complete nonsense.”

Supporting Ferrari’s perspective, Nicolas Bourbon, co-founder of the KamiPay payments solution, clarified that Milei’s administration does not specifically support Bitcoin over other currencies, emphasizing the leader’s respect for currency freedom.

Both Ferrari and Bourbon suggest that this regulatory measure aims to appease international institutions rather than directly benefit Argentinian citizens or the cryptocurrency sector.

The context of the regulatory update is a sharp increase in cryptocurrency adoption in Argentina, driven by an unprecedented inflation rate exceeding 270%.

As reported earlier by crypto.news, Argentinians are increasingly turning to Bitcoin and other digital currencies as a financial refuge, leading to a rise in both legitimate transactions and scam activities. As such, the CNV’s regulation claims to mitigate these risks without stifling innovation in the crypto space.

Argentina’s expansion in the global crypto exchange industry reflects the country’s growing importance in the international crypto landscape.

OKX’s launch offers Argentinians broader access to digital assets and web3 technologies, amidst the economic challenges posed by high inflation and the peso’s devaluation, it is nevertheless one of the crown jewel’s in the country’s crypto scene.

Additionally, Argentina’s several of provinces have announced their intention to create their own currencies, a decision that is part of a broader economic strategy that includes significant measures like a 50% devaluation of the peso. It permits local currencies to address financial challenges at the provincial level, though it raises concerns about potential inflationary effects.

With the latest directive Argentina seems poised to capture additional market share in the country’s evolving crypto landscape. Indeed, the latest regulatory shift appears to be in line with other Latin American countries like El Salvador, whose President Nayib Bukele announced in 2019 it’s country would be pivoting to a Bitcoin denominated digital currency as a replacement to the US dollar."

https://crypto.news/telegram-rolls-out-ton-based-revenue-sharing-system/,Telegram rolls out TON-based revenue sharing system,2024-04-01 06:53:15+00:00,"Denis Omelchenko, Dorian Batycka","The Telegram messenger has unveiled a new revenue sharing system that allows channels’ owners to get 50% of revenue from ads displayed on their channels.

In a blog post on Mar. 31, Telegram announced the launch of a new revenue sharing program that aims to bolster its platform’s appeal to content creators.

Described as the “most generous reward systems in the history of social media,” the program allocates 50% of the revenue from ads in Toncoin (TON) to channel owners hosting ads.

Effective immediately, public channel owners with a minimum of 1,000 subscribers are eligible to receive the 50% revenue share from ads displayed within their channels. The blog post outlines that these funds can be withdrawn without any fees or reinvested into various Telegram features such as ads, collectible usernames, or Premium giveaways.

Telegram says the initiative was made possible thanks to a “new type of ads,” which users can purchase using TON. However, it’s unclear whether the revenue sharing applies only to TON-purchased ads or extends to advertisements bought using fiat currency as well. According to the blog post, TON-purchased ads are not displayed in random channels, which is why their buyers would have to choose the “exact channels where you’d like it to appear.”

“Telegram ads are not based on user data. They depend only on the channel in which you see them – and they directly benefit channel owners.” Telegram

Following the announcement, TON’s price soared by more than 5% to $5.48 before retracting to $5.1, according to CoinMarketCap data. In late February, crypto.news reported that Telegram would cap its Toncoin holdings at 10% to address concerns regarding the potential concentration of the tokens within its ecosystem.

In a post on his channel, Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov acknowledged the community’s worries about the company holding “an unhealthy share of Toncoin” due to advertisement sales made exclusively for TON. To mitigate concentration risks, Telegram plans to sell its surplus TON holdings to long-term investors at a discounted rate, under a lockup and vesting plan ranging from one to four years."

“By no stretch can Mr. Storm be deemed to have conspired to launder funds,” Storm’s attorneys argued in a March 29 filing with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Storm’s lawyers claimed that Tornado Cash “became immutable” and made publicly available before being used by the hacker groups sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury.

As a result, Storm allegedly had little control over preventing a “sanctioned entity from using it.”

Prosecutors allege that Tornado Cash helped the North Korean Lazarus Group evade U.S. sanctions, reportedly enabling the regime to finance its nuclear program.

Furthermore, the lawyers argued that Tornado Cash was not a money-transmitting business because it did not charge a fee for sending payments and users had complete control of their cryptocurrency.

They said that Storm sought to create software solutions to ensure financial privacy for law-abiding cryptocurrency users and that the charges are “fatally flawed and should be dismissed.”

Storm pled not guilty to all allegations in September 2023. He was released on a $2 million bond shortly after his arrest and is primarily barred from traveling outside of specified regions of New York, New Jersey, Washington, and California.

This comes as the US government maintains its aggressive crackdown on cryptocurrency mixing services.

However, the crypto community values crypto mixers because they can give improved privacy and even confidentiality for people seeking to conduct anonymous business transactions for legitimate reasons.

At one point, the Arbitrum DAO proposed transferring approximately $1.3 million in ARB tokens to cover Storm’s legal bills.

The proposal stated that Tornado Cash is a beacon of privacy and security in the cryptocurrency sector, offering consumers a secure means to perform private transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

“No one shall be subject to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks,” the Arbitrum community said at that time.

The plan has since been removed (the reasons for its removal are unclear).

In February, the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe canceled its fundraiser aimed at covering the legal costs in the Tornado Cash case, citing a breach of its service terms. The policy prevented fundraising activities that could pose risks or liabilities to the platform, its staff, or its users. Despite gathering $30,000 in support, GoFundMe refunded all contributions following the cancellation.

This development, first reported by Bloomberg, is a significant milestone for the Los Angeles-based firm.

Former Coinbase executives Dan Romero and Varun Srinivasan co-founded the company in 2020. Now, it is poised to hit unicorn valuation as it continues to make waves in the decentralized social media space.

According to Bloomberg, quoting sources familiar with the matter, crypto investment firm Paradigm is leading the investment charge.

Merkle Manufactory boasts two flagship products: the Farcaster protocol with blockchain integration and Warpcast, a social app similar to X. The Farcaster social media platform has been gaining traction in recent months.

The company last secured funding in July 2022, raising $30 million in a round led by a16z Crypto. One of the co-founders, Dan Romero, a former vice president at Coinbase, confirmed the ongoing funding round in a Warpcast post on March 29.

In the post, he said, “Wanted to let everyone know that Merkle Manufactory is closing a new round of financing.” However, he stopped short of disclosing the exact amount.

In a recent podcast, Romero emphasized Farcaster’s core principle of decentralization, stating that the platform’s design aims to prevent any single entity from exerting control.

He highlighted the introduction of Frames, a new feature within the Farcaster ecosystem that allows for enhanced interactivity and functionality, catering to a growing user base.

The introduction of Frames sparked remarkable growth for Farcaster, with daily active users surging to over 50,000 in early February, a stark increase from previous months. This surge in engagement and user numbers underscored the platform’s appeal and potential in the competitive landscape of decentralized social media.

News of Farcaster’s newfound valuation seems to have gone down well among its community.

According to DappRadar, in the last 24 hours, the number of unique active addresses interacting with Farcaster has gone up by a whopping 77%, with nearly 9k transactions worth more than $24k carried out between them.

However, over 30 days, the picture hasn’t been as rosy, with the number of users interacting with Farcaster falling by more than 63%.

Additionally, the total number of transactions made between wallets dropped nearly 60% in that time, a percentage drop also witnessed in Farcaster’s transaction volumes, which amounted to about $145,000."

Altcoins such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and ORDI (ORDI) experienced substantial gains, riding on Bitcoin’s momentum.

The upsurge observed in the market culminated in a 4.3% increase in the global crypto market capitalization, which rose to $2.66 trillion on March 31 as the market saw an influx of $11 billion in capital.

Here’s an analysis of some of those performances.

BTC, SHIB and ORDI prices – March 31 | Source: Santiment

Bitcoin reclaims $70,000

The previous week saw one of Bitcoin’s worst weekly performances. The premier crypto’s $73,794 all-time high gave way to bearish pressure, which saw Bitcoin break below the $70,000 territory — nearly relinquishing the $60,000 zone.

A recovery push rekindled investor optimism, allowing BTC to reclaim $70,000.

A significant portion of the week’s upward trajectory occurred on March 25, when BTC soared to $71,213. Bitcoin concluded the day with a 4% increase, marking its largest intraday gain for the week.

This rebound also coincided with a positive shift in momentum for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. These financial instruments ended five days of outflows when they recorded $15.7 million in net inflows on March 25.

The ETF market observed significant capital injections on March 26, with inflows reaching $418 million, the highest since March 13.

Bitcoin largely remained in a consolidation phase, encountering strong resistance at $71,754. However, the asset upheld the support at $68,362. Throughout this period, Bitcoin experienced fluctuating trends, yet it successfully retained the gains achieved earlier in the week.

At the time of reporting, Bitcoin is valued at $70,409, reflecting a weekly gain of 4.76%. While trading above $70,000, its daily relative strength index (RSI) remains below overbought levels at 58.62, implying a potential for continued growth.

Shiba Inu’a winning streak

Shiba Inu concluded last previous week with a bullish performance, which continued into this week, resulting in a four-day winning streak at the outset. Despite benefiting from Bitcoin’s upward momentum on March 25, SHIB only saw a modest 2.24% increase by day’s end.

This increase was adequate to sustain its three-day winning streak, which began on March 23.

Shiba Inu continued its upward trajectory into Tuesday, March 26, defying market trends with an intraday gain of 6.76%. With this rally, SHIB closed above $0.00003 for the first time in 12 days.

Despite a mild correction the following day, the meme-inspired token maintained its position above $0.00003. Shiba Inu utilized this price threshold as a launching pad for its subsequent price surge, reaching a peak of $0.00003285 on March 28, before moderating to end the day with a gain of 6.10%.

In the ensuing days, Shiba Inu encountered a significant correction. However, it managed to uphold the $0.000030 level, looking to push toward $0.000031.

The asset currently stands at an 8.5% increase for the week, with its current price resting at $0.00003048.

ORDI among top 24-hour gainers

Inspired by Casey Rodarmor’s Ordinals Protocol, the ORDI token emerged as one of the standout performers last week.

The asset experienced a significant underperformance initially, with a 4% decline from its opening price to a low of $60.9 on March 28. This retest of the $60 level resulted in sufficient strength for a rebound.

The rebound propelled Bitcoin-centric cryptocurrency ORDI to achieve a substantial 8.78% gain on Saturday, March 30, marking its most significant intraday increase in the past ten days.

This performance led to the recapture of the $70 price level. Although the asset closed below $70 on March 30, it resumed its upward trajectory as of this morning.

With a notable 10.60% surge in the last 24 hours, ORDI has emerged as one of the top performers in the market, securing the fourth position among the largest gainers in the top 100. Additionally, the cryptocurrency has achieved a 10.25% increase for the week."
https://crypto.news/vitalik-buterin-calls-for-higher-quality-meme-coins/,Vitalik Buterin calls for ‘higher quality’ meme coins,2024-03-30 18:05:45+00:00,"Ogwu Osaemezu Emmanuel, Anthony Patrick","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is becoming more vocal about the current meme coin craze.

“I want to see higher quality fun projects that contribute positively to the ecosystem and the world around them (and not just by ‘bringing in users’) get more mindshare,” Buterin wrote on Friday, March 29. “At the least, more good memecoins than bad ones, ideally those that support public goods instead of just enriching insiders and creators.”

Buterin also highlighted the potential for meme coins to serve as a third form of funding technology, catering to various societal causes (i.e., an AntiCancerCoin or ClimateCoin).

He further expressed concerns about the current surge in meme coins. There are currently more than 340 meme coins in circulation, according to CoinGape. Typically, these meme coins are just hyped by founders and insiders and have no real value to the general public.

Some of these meme coins even have openly racist elements within certain projects, particularly in the Solana ecosystem, Buterin noted.

Buterin expressed his concerns about how meme coins are dominating discussions within the crypto space in 2024. He noted their history, dating back to Dogecoin in 2015, and how they were a prominent topic during the 2020-2021 season. However, this time around, their resurgence is causing unease, as they lack innovation and substance.

Despite meme coin shortcomings, Buterin noted a successful example where he gifted half the supply of the Dogelon Mars token to the Methuselah Foundation, fostering a positive relationship between the foundation and the Dogelon Mars community, effectively converting ELON into a charity coin.

In exploring solutions, Buterin emphasized the importance of creating meaningful and engaging games within the cryptocurrency space.

“If the goal is to satisfy people’s desire to have fun, we should be making not simple copy-paste coins but rather more complicated and interesting games,” he said, advocating for the development of immersive experiences akin to “World of Warcraft” that offer both entertainment and utility.

From memes to multibillion-dollar pumps and rug pulls

Meme coins have emerged as a distinctive and contentious asset class, rooted in internet culture, humor, and viral trends. These coins, often named after characters, animals, or memes, have garnered significant attention and investment fervor, resulting in both remarkable gains and notable risks.

Notable meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have captivated traders and investors globally. Initially perceived as an irreverent asset category, meme coins have transformed into a complex and volatile market sector, attracting devoted followers as well as cautious skeptics.

In contrast to conventional cryptocurrencies backed by tangible assets or practical applications, meme coins frequently lack intrinsic value, relying heavily on social media buzz, celebrity endorsements, and online communities for their valuation. This inherent fluidity renders them susceptible to drastic price swings and speculative trading activities.

While meme coins offer the allure of substantial profits during rapid value surges, they also carry inherent risks. Many within the financial sphere regard meme coins as high-risk assets, vulnerable to pump-and-dump schemes, market manipulation, and regulatory scrutiny.

Despite their entertaining facade, meme coins have encountered scrutiny for their associations with scams, rug pulls, and dubious practices. The absence of regulation and oversight in the meme coin realm has resulted in instances of fraud, deceptive marketing, and investor losses."

The Fort Worth, Texas-based firm penned a letter in response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent request for public comments on Nasdaq’s pending application for a rule change to permit the trading of iShares Ethereum Trust.

In the letter, Consensys explained why regulatory concerns about Ethereum’s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation are unfounded.

https://twitter.com/Consensys/status/1773761825034686760

The company also argues that several key aspects of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation make it more resistant to tampering than the Bitcoin (BTC) proof-of-work (PoW) consensus model, which underlies Bitcoin-based exchange-traded products previously approved by the SEC.

The regulatory body’s request, issued on March 8, sought feedback on various aspects of Ethereum, including its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and the concentration of control or influence by a few individuals or entities. It specifically inquired whether these features raise unique concerns about Ethereum’s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation.

One of the highlights of Consensys’ comment letter is Ethereum’s faster block finality under PoS, which ensures provable transaction finality within a shorter timeframe than PoW. Additionally, Ethereum’s PoS relies on a distributed and randomized validation process that prevents large stakeholder control, thus mitigating the risk of manipulation.

The blockchain technology company also emphasized Ethereum’s slashing penalties for validators who violate protocol rules and the network’s Byzantine fault tolerance, making it significantly more costly to attack Ethereum than Bitcoin.

Moreover, it highlighted Ethereum’s environmental benefits, noting that the network’s consensus mechanism is more environmentally friendly than Bitcoin’s.

In the letter, Consensys urged the SEC to approve spot Ethereum ETFs. The company emphasized its commitment to onboarding the next billion users to web3, stating that their comment letter is a step towards driving progress and providing relevant and useful information to the public.

The company expressed its readiness for ongoing, constructive dialogue with the SEC and its staff on the issue.

Other than Consensys, other players in the crypto space have also had their say regarding an Ethereum ETF. In early March, reports surfaced that Coinbase had met with the SEC to discuss a proposal by Grayscale for an ETH exchange-traded fund.

https://crypto.news/court-custodia-bank-federal-reserve-master-account/,US court rejects Custodia Bank’s bid for Fed master account,2024-03-30 14:51:32+00:00,"Julius Mutunkei, Anthony Patrick","The U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming dismissed Custodia Bank’s plea for a Federal Reserve master account.

Custodia Bank, specializing in digital assets, has been seeking a master account from the Federal Reserve since 2020. The account, often described as “a bank account for banks,” is crucial for accessing the Fed’s payment systems.

The Wyoming-based bank had argued that without a master account, it would be at a significant disadvantage — particularly in offering custodial services for crypto-assets compared to traditional banking institutions.

It contended that such a setback would relegate it to a “second-class citizen” status, dependent on intermediary financial institutions. It also said that this dependency undermines its operational autonomy and efficiency.

The Federal Reserve rejected the application in January 2023, citing concerns about Custodia’s involvement in the cryptocurrency sector, which it deemed inconsistent with regulatory requirements.

Regulators grew especially bearish toward the cryptocurrency sector after 2022 saw Celsius crash; Luna and TerraUSD collapse; and FTX go bankrupt (BlockFi also went bankrupt).

Custodia then sued the Federal Reserve, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), and sought a writ of mandamus compelling the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (FRBKC) to grant the master account.

The March 29 ruling, delivered by Chief Judge Scott Skavdahl, sided with the Federal Reserve, dismissing Custodia’s claim that it had not followed appropriate administrative procedures. Judge Skavdahl also stated that the FRBKC had the legal authority to deny Custodia’s application.

https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1773803778874933335

The ruling addressed Custodia’s claim that, as an officially chartered state bank, it was entitled to a master account under federal law. The judge countered this argument, emphasizing that granting master accounts solely based on state chartering laws could lead to regulatory loopholes and potential risks for the broader financial system.

The rejection highlights the broader challenges faced by blockchain-based financial institutions like Custodia, which is one of Wyoming’s pioneering Special Purpose Depository Institutions (SPDIs). It was established to provide banking services to crypto businesses unable to access traditional banking relationships.

This ruling comes against a backdrop of legislative efforts in Wyoming to address challenges faced by blockchain-based businesses. Earlier in March, the state passed a landmark crypto bill to bring decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) under existing laws.

Additionally, Wyoming enacted legislation to protect the rights of Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital asset holders by prohibiting the forced disclosure of private keys to unauthorized entities.

“Challenging the Fed’s strong-arm tactics has always been an uphill battle, but Custodia Bank remains committed to our vision of creating a safe, tech-enabled bank. We are reviewing the Court’s decision and all of our options, including appeal,” said Nathan Miller, a spokesperson for Custodia Bank, told crypto.news."

Despite using Tornado Cash to launder the funds, the individual insisted their actions were meant to expose vulnerabilities, challenging Prisma Finance’s team to acknowledge their oversight publicly.

Record-setting open interest in Bitcoin futures comes as $15.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum options are set to expire, potentially leading to increased volatility.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Justice, charged KuCoin on March 26 for unlawfully operating a digital assets derivatives exchange.

The charge by the CFTC has sparked controversy, particularly regarding jurisdictional boundaries between the CFTC and its sister regulatory body, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

“Owning shares is not the same thing as trading derivatives,” Pham stated, expressing concerns that the CFTC’s complaint conflates the concept of investment securities with trading activities. According to Pham, the agency’s interpretation could potentially infringe upon the SEC’s authority, undermining established investor protection laws.

Pham argued that the complaint “appears to assert that fund shares held by investors—namely, securities—can themselves constitute leveraged trading,” a stance she believes incorrectly merges the nature of a financial instrument with financial activity, disrupting securities market foundations.

The incident highlights the ongoing debate and confusion over the precise regulatory purview of cryptocurrencies within the United States.

The SEC and CFTC have previously clashed over classifying specific cryptocurrencies, such as Ether (ETH). SEC Chair Gary Gensler suggests many cryptocurrencies fall under securities, while the CFTC views Ether as a commodity in its recent charges.

The divergence in viewpoints shows the critical regulatory situation, as CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam pointed out during a congressional hearing earlier this month. Behnam emphasized the significant implications if the SEC were to classify ether as a security, potentially putting CFTC registrants who list ether futures in a position of non-compliance with SEC regulations."

Analysts tracked the movement of funds in wallets involved in the criminal operation. Through two transactions, the hacker sent 1,840 Ethereum (ETH) worth about $6.5 million to the Tornado Cash mixer.

After some time, experts noted that the attacker sent a message to the developers of Prisma Finance. The exploiter wanted to move the funds to a safe place before “moving on to the next step.”

The hacker, whose identity was unknown, also asked the programmers several questions. The attacker was particularly interested in what developers knew about smart contracts and whether the project was audited before deployment.

According to the message, exploiters are driven solely by the need to ensure proper project audits and the security of smart contracts. The hacker did not mention the possible return of stolen funds.

On March 28, Prisma Finance suffered from a security attack. Specialists from Cyvers said that the protocol lost about $9 million, and the attacker financed the hack through the FixedFloat cryptocurrency exchange. However, PeckShield experts provided additional data on the volume of stolen assets, with reported losses of $11.6 million."

The meme coin category recently saw the highest number of transactions, exceeding 2021 bull market levels. The surge was partially driven by Dogecoin (DOGE), which exceeded two million transactions in one day, IntoTheBlock noted.

However, the 2024 bull market has several differences compared to previous performance. In just a month, the market capitalization of the meme coin category more than doubled.

“The total market capitalization for the meme coin category recently hit a cycle peak of over $50 billion.” IntoTheBlock report

Blockchains with low transaction fees, such as Solana, Avalanche, and Base, have become the platforms of choice for many of these new meme coins. Lower gas fees make trading on these blockchains more accessible to retail investors.

However, the sustainability of this growth depends on broader market dynamics, including potential changes in significant cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), which could impact the trajectory of the meme coin market, according to analysts.

According to the Immunefi report, in the first three months of 2024, crypto projects lost more than $321 million due to 46 hacks and 15 fraudulent incidents.

Decentralized finance (defi) is a prime target for hackers, accounting for 100% of losses in the crypto industry. According to Immunefi CEO Mitchell Amador, defi suffers from frequent compromise of private keys.

“Particularly, the ecosystem has witnessed a significant volume of losses due to private key compromises, emphasizing the critical need to secure both code and protocol infrastructure.” Mitchell Amador, Founder and CEO at Immunefi

The number of hacker attacks in the first quarter of 2024 decreased by 17.5% compared to the same period in 2023. Attackers often exploited the Ethereum (ETH) network, the victim of 33 incidents. The BNB Chain (BNB) blockchain saw the second-most attacks, having been exploited 14 times. Ethereum and BNB Chain accounted for over 73% of the lost funds.

The initiative seeks to fill a gap in the market, akin to the role Robinhood plays in the U.S. for stock options trading, but focusing on the defi sector.

Supported by Framework Ventures, Delphi Ventures, and Blizzard the Avalanche Ecosystem Fund, Arrow Markets is aiming to capture a significant portion of the defi options market.

The platform operates on Avalanche’s C-chain and introduces a Request-for-Execution (RFE) system that enhances the traditional Request-for-Quote (RFQ) approach by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure more efficient options pricing and reduce counterparty risk.

Arrow Markets’ system allows users to specify their price and slippage tolerances, enabling direct request submissions to the blockchain for matching. The process aims to eliminate unnecessary steps and optimize prices in scenarios of low liquidity.

“This means that market makers are exposed to far less stale quote risk allowing them to quote ‘tighter bid-ask spreads’ while allowing users to have control over how much ‘slippage’ they are comfortable over the reference quote. It’s a win-win for both sides,” Edward Mehrez, co-founder of Arrow Markets, told crypto.news.

A distinctive feature of Arrow Markets is its user interface and experience, notably the ‘lite mode,’ which guides users through a selection of options and strategies based on their market outlook and preferences regarding the underlying asset, like Ethereum (ETH).

The project also emphasizes education and practice for traders of all experience levels, providing extensive resources and a testnet environment for risk-free trading practice.

“We are excited to back Arrow Markets to help fuel the growth of on-chain options market,” said Roy Learner, Partner at Framework Ventures.

“Arrow’s design will simplify the options trading experience, making it easy for retail and institutions alike to trade and settle any options strategy on-chain,” he added."

https://crypto.news/demystifying-eu-crypto-legislation-insights-from-former-icelandic-central-bank-chairman/,"Demystifying EU crypto legislation, insights from former Icelandic Central Bank chairman",2024-03-29 13:36:00+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","In an exclusive with crypto.news, Jón Helgi Egilsson, a former Icelandic central bank chairman, sets out how the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is entering the final phase of crypto asset regulation in the European Union (EU), and what this means for Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation.

The cryptocurrency market is becoming more deeply ingrained in the public sector. The need for a legal framework that guarantees security, stability, and trust is of the utmost importance, with the latest MiCA regulations being hailed as the answer.

Yet, despite its significance, MiCA is enveloped in confusion and misunderstanding, particularly regarding its impact on stablecoins and their compliance requirements.

In an exclusive interview with crypto.news, Jón Helgi Egilsson, a figure well-versed in the intricacies of financial regulation and the crypto landscape, describes what the market and MiCA regulations has in store for the crypto industry.

The co-founder and chairman of Monerium and a former chairman of the supervisory board at the Central Bank of Iceland, Egilsson is uniquely positioned to shed light on MiCA’s nuances. Through his insights, crypto.news looks to decipher its implications for the future of cryptocurrency in Europe and beyond.

What is your stance on the current state of the MiCA regulations?

MiCA addresses three types of assets; e-money tokens (EMTs), asset reference tokens, and crypto assets. MiCA does not address NFTs and DAOs. I have expressed my view before that a technological specific legislation for e-money deployed on blockchains is not helpful.

You highlighted a common misunderstanding regarding the regulatory status of fiat-backed stablecoins in Europe. Can you elaborate on the challenges stablecoin issuers might face as they transition to compliance under both the Electronic Money Directive and MiCA?

Many seem to believe that stablecoins will only be illegal once MiCA comes into force. But that’s a misconception. Fiat-backed stablecoins are already illegal under current e-money laws unless issued by licensed entities. Some issuers have simply chosen to ignore this and operate without authorization. This creates an unfair advantage against compliant issuers who have gone through the proper e-money licensing process. It’s incredibly frustrating to see bad actors gain market share by flouting the rules because EU financial authorities are not doing their job. The real issue is enforcement.

MiCA and the Electronic Money Directive (EMD2) both apply to stablecoin issuers in certain circumstances. Given the potential overlap, how do you foresee this impacting the operational clarity for stablecoin issuers. Does this dual regulation approach benefit or complicate the stablecoin ecosystem?

What MiCA effectively does is to confirm that digital cash offered within the EU has to be regulated as e-money. Nothing new there. However, it adds some provisions based on a claim that it is necessary due to the peer-to-peer nature of the blockchain technology.

How can European regulators ensure fairness in the competitive landscape, given the advantage U.S. companies might have under less strict regulations? What steps are needed to balance innovation with fair competition?

The more lax regulatory environment for stablecoins in the US does give US-based issuers a competitive advantage in the short term. They can bring products to market faster and with less friction than their European counterparts who must deal with the stricter requirements of EMD2 and MiCA.

However, this advantage may be short-lived because US regulators are also looking to implement more comprehensive stablecoin rules. In the long run, Europe’s proactive and unified approach could prove beneficial, as compliant EU-based issuers will have access to the whole European market and enjoy greater legitimacy and trust from consumers.

What about international regulations?

International coordination around stablecoin regulation would also help level the playing field globally. Regulators should collaborate through bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to align principles and mitigate risks of regulatory arbitrage. A race to the bottom in regulatory standards benefits no one in the long run.

A key area of focus in MiCA has been reinforcing solvency requirements for stablecoin issuers. Regulators hail this as fundamental to mitigating risks associated with the inherent volatility, even for stablecoins. MiCA mandates a stringent solvency standard that ensures that stablecoins, often viewed as safe harbors in the turbulent crypto seas, are backed by robust and reliable financial practices.

MiCA also addresses the issue of proof of solvency among stablecoin issuers. How important is this aspect of regulation for the stability and trust in the broader cryptocurrency market, and do you believe the requirements under MiCA are sufficient?

Proof of solvency is addressed in the e-money legislation and is paramount for financial services and financial stability. Under EU law stablecoin issuers should be regulated as e-money institutions. E-money issuers have to adhere to the supervision of financial authorities, maintain certain own equity standards etc.

What about unauthorized stablecoin issuers?

Unauthorized stablecoin issuers could trigger a domino effect with far-reaching consequences. MiCA reaffirms that stablecoin issues have to be licensed e-money issuers and therefore maintain adequate reserves and submit to regular audits. These measures are crucial for building trust and stability in the broader cryptocurrency market. While MiCA’s requirements simply reaffirms existing legislation in this regard, i.e. continuous monitoring and strict rules. A robust and transparent regulatory framework is essential to prevent stablecoin failures that could potentially destabilize the entire DeFi landscape, that is why it is strange that current EU laws are not enforced.

Can MiCA serve as a model for balancing innovation with consumer protection and market integrity?

Striking the right balance between innovation and regulation is crucial for the healthy development of the stablecoin industry. While stringent oversight is necessary to protect consumers and maintain financial stability, overly restrictive regulations could stifle innovation.

MiCA requires Crypto Asset Service Providers to have robust governance arrangements, including transparent lines of responsibility and recovery plans. How do you see these requirements affecting the operational models of CASPs, particularly smaller entities trying to navigate the regulatory landscape?

Like any business or sector, added regulation is going to add friction. In most cases, though, the European Union’s intentions with MiCA are to regularize digital asset businesses and provide a clear framework for their operation. While the decentralization paradigm that underpins many crypto projects may not always align perfectly with regulators’ desire for clear accountability, the overall goal of protecting consumers and promoting market integrity is well-placed.

Looking forward, how do you envision the global impact of MiCA regulations on the cryptocurrency industry? Do you foresee other jurisdictions adopting similar frameworks?

I think the e-money directive (EMD) is an export standard from Brussel that could underpin a global standard for stablecoins, no doubt. But with regards to MiCA and how it creates technology specific e-money legislation for the blockchain technology I do not see the added value.

However, MiCA also addresses asset reference tokens and crypto assets, which is the novel part of MiCA – not e-money. Apart from e-money, MiCA is a significant milestone in digital asset regulation due to its novelty and attempt to regulate it. Its impact will likely extend beyond the European Union.

As the first comprehensive regulatory framework for asset-reference tokens, and crypto assets, MiCA sets a powerful precedent. If it’s judged to be successful, other jurisdictions may end up copying large parts of the regulation."

While the Ethereum co-founder acknowledged “people’s desire to have fun,” he still called for higher-quality projects in the crypto space that avoid “enriching insiders and creators.”

The value of meme coins currently stands at $69.1 billion, according to CoinGecko data, surpassing sectors like gamefi ($33.6 billion) and tokens focused on artificial intelligence ($41.3 billion).

Hougan emphasized the ongoing due diligence processes by investment committees and consultants as a crucial step before committing to Bitcoin investments.

He mentioned that while waiting for these developments, Bitcoin’s price might experience sideways movement in response to minor sentiment shifts. Nonetheless, Hougan is optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, citing a robust bull market with a nearly 300% increase over the past 15 months and strong reasons for continued growth.

The January approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs significantly opened the crypto market to investment professionals. Hougan believes this marks the beginning of interest from professionals managing trillions of dollars, a process that will take years.

He also highlighted the $12 billion influx into ETFs since their launch, calling it the most successful ETF debut. Yet, he anticipates that global wealth managers allocating just 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin could lead to $1 trillion in inflows, making the initial $12 billion seem minimal.

Earlier in March, Hougan suggested that spot Ethereum ETFs could attract more assets if launched after May.

Given a more cautious outlook for a May debut, he proposed a December launch could be more beneficial. The delay would give Wall Street and traditional finance sectors more time to understand the complexities of cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin.

Hougan estimated an eight to nine-month period is needed for Wall Street to adjust to Bitcoin before considering another ETF."

The integration marks a progressive step in enhancing liquidity and usability within zkSync, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum (ETH) that leverages zero-knowledge proofs for increased efficiency and reduced costs.

According to the latest blog post from Circle, “The forthcoming native USDC on zkSync is set to usher in a new era of seamless transactions and integration capabilities for developers and institutional users alike. USDC, issued by Circle, will be native to zkSync and is the official form of USDC for the zkSync ecosystem.”

The transition to native support is anticipated to gradually shift the current liquidity from the bridged USDC —originally from Ethereum and moved to zkSync via the zkSync Era Bridge — to the new native format.

1/ Drumroll… native $USDC is coming soon to @zkSync!



zkSync is a leading Layer 2 blockchain that is hyperscaling Ethereum through zero-knowledge tech and built-in account abstraction.

The inherent benefits of native USDC on zkSync include its status as a regulated, fully reserved stablecoin that is always redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars. Additionally, it will facilitate institutional on- and off-ramps like Circle Mint for eligible users and ensure easy integration into existing decentralized applications (dApps).

The blog explains that “Ahead of the launch of native USDC, the Ethereum-bridged form of USDC on block explorers like zkSync Era Block Explorer will be renamed USDC.e” to distinguish between the upcoming native USDC and its predecessor.

Circle recently partnered with Solana to bring USDC and its cross-chain transfer protocol to its blockchain ecosystem."

Experts in the latest report claim that MicroStrategy shares have soared on the back of the recent rise in Bitcoin (BTC) prices, but as is often the case with cryptocurrencies, “things have gotten carried away.”

“We are long bitcoin and short shares of MicroStrategy, a proxy for Bitcoin which trades at an unjustifiable premium to the digital asset that drives its value.” Kerrisdale Capital experts

Part of Kerrisdale Capital’s argument for MicroStrategy shares centered on increasing investor access to financial instruments that act as proxy investments for Bitcoin. Experts noted that the days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare and unique way to get exposure to Bitcoin “are long over.”

“Bitcoin is now easily obtainable through brokerages, crypto exchanges, and more recently low fee ETPs and ETFs.” Kerrisdale Capital experts

Meanwhile, MicroStrategy continues to pursue its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The company recently announced that it has about 214,250 Bitcoins, about 1% of the total cryptocurrency supply. The company used profits from previously placed convertible bonds maturing in 2031 to purchase the first cryptocurrency.

In addition, against the background of the recovery of the BTC price above $70,000, MicroStrategy’s market capitalization reached a new high, surpassing the level of $31.85 billion. According to the Companies Market Cap, MicroStrategy now ranks 606 among the largest companies in the world by market capitalization.

According to the sentencing, he will serve 20 years and another 60 months in prison.

Judge Kaplan also found Bankman-Fried guilty of obstruction of justice concerning his text to the former general counsel, which was labeled witness tampering. The judge also found Bankman-Fried’s claim that he did not know Alameda was using FTX’s customer funds false.



During the sentencing, one victim, Sunil Kavuri, took the stand and expressed how Bankman-Fried’s actions impacted him and others. Kavuri mentioned at least three individuals committed suicide because of FTX.

Bankman-Fried also made statements before the sentencing, mentioning how a series of bad decisions ruined years of hard work from his colleagues. The FTX founder mentioned several colleagues by name and expressed their passion and enthusiasm for the company. Bankman-Fried also accepted that the liquidity crisis was partly his fault and that he knew Alameda wouldn’t have survived but thought FTX would have.

“They threw themselves into it, then I threw all that away. It haunts me every day. I made a series of bad decisions. They weren’t selfish decisions.” – Sam Bankman-Fried

Sam Bankman-Fried’s court proceedings

Last November, a federal jury in New York found Sam Bankman-Fried guilty of two fraud counts and five conspiracy charges. Since his conviction, Bankman-Fried has been detained at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center and lost bail privileges due to accusations of witness tampering.

Over the past few months, there have been significant debates between Bankman-Fried’s defense team and the U.S. Department of Justice attorneys regarding the severity of his punishment. The defense suggested a sentence no longer than six years, while prosecutors argued for 40 to 50 years, citing unparalleled greed and deceit in orchestrating an $8 billion fraud.

FTX’s collapse in November 2022 caused a ripple effect across the entire crypto industry. Reports from 52 customers submitted yesterday showed the severe mental impact it had on the victims.

Bankman-Fried and his associates intermingled the exchange’s funds with those of Alameda Research, a related hedge fund, using customer funds for personal gain. This led to an $8 billion financial gap, triggering the exchange’s downfall when numerous customers attempted to withdraw their cryptocurrency holdings."
https://crypto.news/ethereum-blobs-utilization-inscriptions/,Ethereum blobs pushed to utilization limit due to inscriptions,2024-03-28 15:25:29+00:00,"Bralon Hill, Brian Stone","Ethereum’s network is strained as blob transaction demand surges, pushing capacity to its limits due to the popularity of inscriptions.

Blobs are a feature that was introduced following the Ethereum network’s Dencun upgrade earlier this month.

The upgrade, which aimed to reduce the cost of Layer 2 transactions by substituting the traditional “calldata” method with blob transactions, has evidently succeeded in its objective. It has made transactions cheaper for end users by enabling Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and Linea to utilize blobs for posting transactions.

Reports indicate that “the rate of blob transactions on Ethereum has surged, exceeding the network’s set capacity,” demonstrating the immediate impact of the Dencun upgrade. Adding inscriptions on blobs inspired by Bitcoin Ordinals allows users to embed unique fungible and non-fungible artifacts within these transactions.

The function has introduced a new dimension of utility for blobs, even though they are ephemeral and are removed from the network after 18 days. However, full archival nodes can retain this data indefinitely.

A recent analysis from Dune Analytics reveals a notable trend: 40% of blob transactions are now related to inscriptions. The study shows a significant utilization rate, demonstrating the highest usage among various Ethereum (ETH) L2 solutions.

Currently, the network faces a blob contention, with blobs operating at a 100% utilization rate. The situation is further compounded by a considerable backlog in the mempool, where 160 blobs await processing. Given Ethereum’s current capacity to include only up to six blobs per block, the backlog is roughly 40 times higher than the network can accommodate in a single block."

Per Bloomberg, transactions worth over $20 billion may have gone through the Russian crypto exchange Garantex. Authorities are now reviewing the deals as part of the allies’ efforts to combat sanctions evasion that is supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine.

The payments under scrutiny were processed through the Moscow cryptocurrency exchange using the Tether (USDT) stablecoin. Sources say the transfers came after Garantex was hit with U.S. and U.K. sanctions for allegedly facilitating financial crimes and illegal transactions in Russia.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has been trying to crack down on cryptocurrency exchanges like Garantex since the early days of the war. Sources said that the $20 billion in transactions would represent one of the most significant breaches of sanctions imposed on Russia since they were introduced.

OFAC said that the exchange, operated from the Federation Tower in Moscow City, deliberately ignores obligations to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

After the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, western countries initiated a strict sanctions regime against Russia, and regulators are seriously concerned about the use of cryptocurrencies to circumvent sanctions.

Targeting retail investors in Hong Kong, the bank’s Gold Token went live on March 28. The token will be available for HSBC customers on the bank’s online banking platform and its mobile application.

According to the bank, this is the first retail product from the institution, launched in response to the Chinese regulator’s push for the introduction of digital assets for public use.

The gold tokens, as the name suggests, are backed by physical gold. The proof of ownership for the tokens will be verified on the bank’s proprietary private blockchain dubbed Orion. The tokens will also be minted on this blockchain.

“We acknowledge the rising demand for digital assets and the existing familiarity of our customers with gold investment,” Maggie Ng, general manager and head of wealth and personal banking Hong Kong at HSBC, said in a statement.

Launched in 2022, the HSBC Orion is a DLT-based bond tokenization platform developed by HSBC. The platform was designed to enhance the efficiency, security, and flexibility of bond issuance and trading.

“We are proud that HSBC Gold Token, powered by HSBC Orion, is the first retail product in Hong Kong that is based on distributed ledger technology, as authorized by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC),” Ng added.

Prior to this launch, HSBC had teased a tokenized gold offering in collaboration with Ripple owned crypto safe-keeping specialist Metaco. The move was part of the bank’s new digital asset custody plan.

The introduction of the tokenized gold product follows the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission’s (SFC) November circulars. The two circulars urged issuers to introduce tokenized SFC-authorized investment products.



“The SFC is of the view that it is appropriate to allow primary dealing of tokenized SFC-authorised investment products, as long as the underlying product can meet all the applicable product authorization requirements and the additional safeguards to address the new risks associated with the tokenization arrangement,” one of the circulars noted.

The regulator claims that tokenized products can help reduce operational costs while also enhancing efficiency and transparency.

As of late, several banks and traditional institutions have been eyeing entry into the asset tokenization sector to introduce real-world assets (RWA) onto blockchains.

The so-called “dirty crypto” appears to be highly centered on the TRON blockchain network, founded by Chinese entrepreneur Justin Sun, which accounted for approximately 45% of all illicit transactions last year. According to a recent research report titled “The Illicit Crypto Economy” by TRM Labs, the figure marks an increase from 41% in 2022, with Ethereum following at 24% and Bitcoin at 18%.

The San Francisco-headquartered firm found Tether (USDT) to be the stablecoin with the largest amount of illicit volume. Issued by Tether Inc. the stablecoin has “cemented its position as the currency of choice for use by terrorist financing entities,” TRM Labs says, adding that USDT accounted for over $19 billion worth of illicit funds, while the other stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), has only $428.9 million in illicit volume.

“[…] among those terror financing campaigns that continued to accept cryptocurrency, the number of unique TRON addresses that received Tether (USDT) rose by 125%.” TRM Labs

TRON also appears to be a preferred network for hackers associated with North Korea, who frequently exchange stolen funds, predominantly for USDT on the network. Later on, these laundered crypto funds are converted to fiat currency through high-volume over-the-counter (OTC) brokers, the firm says. As of press time, the TRON developers made no public statement regarding the findings.

1) ETF Flows Will Continue for Years: A good question to ask about the new bitcoin ETFs is whether the incredible inflows we’ve seen in the first two months represent a one-time surge… — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) March 26, 2024

He suggested that the landscape for Bitcoin ETF investments would evolve gradually over the next couple of years through numerous individual assessments.

As these significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs reflect a growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency, ARK Invest’s CEO, Cathie Wood, has projected Bitcoin’s price could reach as high as $3.8 million, driven by its growing role in the “financial superhighway.”

Wood contends that the SEC’s cautious approach to institutional Bitcoin investments could inadvertently boost its price.

The launch of these financial products has led to a spike in demand, breaking previous US ETF investment records and stirring renewed interest in Bitcoin, which these funds directly procure and manage.

Industry experts support Wood’s view that the forthcoming Bitcoin halving event in April will lead to a supply shock, bolstering the ongoing demand-driven price rally."

This price movement indicates growing optimism among investors about the potential merger of these AI-focused projects.

The surge in value comes ahead of a scheduled community vote on April 2 for a proposed token merger involving SingularityNet, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, with a combined market capitalization of approximately $5.3 billion.

If approved, this merger would lead to the creation of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s ASI token, aiming to consolidate the strengths of the three entities into a unified force capable of competing against Big Tech’s dominance in AI.

The alliance, set to be known as the Superintelligence Collective, aspires to merge Fetch.ai’s decentralized AI application platform, SingularityNET’s AI services marketplace, and Ocean Protocol’s data exchange framework.

The initiative is a response to the exponential growth of AI projects and aims to provide a decentralized alternative for AI development, use, and monetization, challenging giants like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft.

Under the merger terms, a total of 2.631 billion ASI tokens will be distributed, replacing the existing AGIX, FET, and OCEAN tokens, which would then be convertible into ASI at predetermined rates.

The merger details include a one-to-one swap rate for FET into ASI tokens, and additional ASI tokens will be minted to allocate 867 million to AGIX holders and 611 million to OCEAN tokenholders, translating to fixed conversion rates for these tokens into ASI.

Token holders storing their AGIX and OCEAN tokens on exchanges need not take any action, as the conversion to ASI tokens will be handled directly by the exchanges.

The strategic move is supported by on-chain data and market sentiment analyses indicating a positive outlook for the merger, with a significant increase in the combined market cap of the category to $43.12 billion observed."

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) alongside the U.K.’s Office of Foreign Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) jointly designated two individuals and three entities as key financial donors involved in crypto fundraising for Hamas, a Palestinian Sunni Islamist political and military movement designated as a foreign terrorist organization.

In a press release on Mar. 27, OFAC announced sanctions against Gaza Now, which operates on platforms such as Telegram, Instagram, and X, for its role in “fundraising efforts to support Hamas” following the October 2023 terrorist attack carried out by Hamas against Israel.

“Treasury remains committed to degrading Hamas’ ability to finance its terrorist activities, including through online fundraising campaigns that seek to funnel money directly to the group.” Brian Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence

According to OFAC, following the October 2023 terrorist attack, Gaza Now began a fundraising effort in support of Hamas.

Data revealed by blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis shows that OFAC has sanctioned a few crypto addresses controlled by the media outlet, which have been used in crypto donation campaigns. In total, those addresses have received nearly $4.5 million in crypto from mixers, smart contracts, and “primarily from mainstream exchanges.”

“Gaza Now makes no secret of its support for terrorist organizations. In the screenshot of its Telegram channel below, for instance, the outlet expresses praise for the Hamas-aligned Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades.” Chainalysis

The analytics firm noted that Gaza Now frequently changed crypto addresses due to increased scrutiny following the attacks and the channel’s growing number of followers. The news outlet regularly posted and then deleted donation requests, switching between various cryptocurrencies as part of these efforts, Chainalysis added.

The latest move by OFAC represents another effort to disrupt Hamas’ operational capabilities in the wake of the October 2023 terrorist attack, which saw hundreds of Hamas militants invading Israel and launching thousands of rockets, ranking by the Center for Strategic and International Studies as the third-deadliest terrorist attack since 1970, trailing only behind the 9/11 attacks."

The statement highlighted that “over USD 15 billion in options notional open interest (OI) will expire this week,” marking a historic event in Deribit’s operational history. This Friday is poised to witness one of the platform’s largest expirations of options contracts.

The expiration includes $9.5 billion in BTC options open interest out of $26.3 billion and $5.7 billion in ETH options open interest out of $13.2 billion, accounting for 40% and 43% of the total OI, respectively.

Further details provided by Deribit reveal the impact of current market conditions on these expirations.

“For BTC options, at a price level of [$70,000], USD 3.9 billion will expire in the money. Similarly, for ETH options, USD 2.6 billion will expire in the money,” Derebit explained.

The figures are considerably higher than typical, attributed to the recent price rally in both cryptocurrencies. This is expected to induce upward pressure or volatility on the underlying assets due to the higher in-the-money (ITM) expiries and the diminishing influence of the lower max pain levels.

Analyzing the market’s volatility aspect, Deribit notes a contango in the volatility surface for both BTC and ETH. Current implied volatility (IV) levels for March 29 options stand at 63% and 67%, respectively, anticipating reaching a healthier 80% further along the curve. The observation suggests market participants do not foresee significant price fluctuations until expiration.

“$465 million in BTC March Future plus $230 million in the March ETH future will expire,” Derebit additionally disclosed, totaling approximately $695 million of the $1.9 billion currently outstanding.

The platform also highlighted the current open interest in its dated futures, stating that the current OI in their dated futures of $1.9 billion is the highest OI number of any crypto market, driven by an annualized basis of about 15% – 20%.

The high level of interest is caused by the significant returns generated, sparking considerable anticipation for substantial trading activity around the expiry period."

“Several on-chain indicators have flagged an uptick in profit-taking events,” the analytics firm wrote in a newsletter received by Crypto.news.

Glassnode’s analysis revealed that as Bitcoin’s price retracted from its all-time high to a recent low of $61,200, approximately 2.0 million Bitcoin shifted from ‘in-profit’ to ‘in-loss.’ However, as the market recovered slightly, around 1.0 million of these coins regained their ‘in-profit’ status due to the substantial volume of transactions at these elevated price levels.

Net Realized Profit/Loss | Source: Glassnode

According to Glassnode, this behavior marks one of the more pronounced ‘supply clusters’ during pullbacks since the lows of 2022.

Glassnode emphasized that a considerable portion of the 2.0 million Bitcoin, with a new cost basis above $61,200, had recently changed hands. This, according to the newsletter, is indicative of previous owners actively capitalizing on profits.

This trend was also exemplified by the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric variations cited in the newsletter, which demonstrated an uptick in profit-taking in the spot markets. Specifically, the Entity-Adjusted SOPR variant has approached levels last seen during the 2021 bull market’s peak, further cementing Glassnode’s profit-taking theory.

Analysts observed that during the rally to the $73.2k all-time high, over $2.6 billion in realized profit was secured through on-chain transactions. The analytics firm attributed 40% of this profit-taking to Long-Term Holders.

Glassnode speculates that some of these investors include those divesting from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Since its conversion to a spot ETF, the Grayscale GBTC fund has seen approximately 277,393 BTC in outflows as of March 27.

Meanwhile, short-term holders reportedly locked in the remaining $1.56 billion in profits. The report added that traders were leveraging the inflowing liquidity and bullish momentum, mirroring previous market cycles.

“Realized profit by both cohorts has reached a similar magnitude to during the 2021 bull market peak.”

Concluding its analysis, Glassnode wrote that the recent trend is “not atypical market behavior.” Historical data has pointed out that similar patterns have been observed during all previous all-time high cycles, it added.

“Each time the Bitcoin price is at, or close to, an all-time high, there’s a division between those wanting to take money off the table and those betting on further increases. It becomes a tug-of-war between Bulls and Bears,” Clive Thompson, a former director in Swiss banking and Bitcoin proponent, told Crypto.news.

This polarization typically leads to a temporary market pause, a phenomenon Thompson notes as “perfectly normal” in the vicinity of all-time highs.

Thompson also noted the recent shift in ETF inflows, which turned positive on Tuesday, March 26, after a week of outflows. This contributed to a modest positive effect on the Bitcoin price, all still below its all time high of $74,000.

“Should the inflows to the ETFs remain positive, we’re likely to see the Bitcoin price surpass previous records and climb higher,” he added.

Glassnode’s observations are shared amidst a recovery phase in the cryptocurrency market. Recent reports indicate that Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen inflows amounting to $418 million, marking the largest influx since March 13."

The project has been in the spotlight over the past week. The price of RIO tokens went from $0.8938 on March 20 to as high as $2.522 on March 27, marking a growth of 197%. The project, working with real-world asset tokenization, is cashing in on the hype surrounding this innovation.

The Realio Network is a defi marketplace powered by RWAs. Founded in 2018 and headquartered in New York, the project is creating a tokenized ecosystem for real-world Assets.

Real-world asset tokenization is the process of converting the ownership of tangible assets to a blockchain. By fragmenting assets like commodities and real estate into tradeable tokens, this process democratizes investment opportunities. RWAs help break geographical constraints, allowing markets to draw in more liquidity while also opening up investment opportunities for a broader user base.

While RWAs aren’t a novel concept, the growing interest in this sector saw a massive boost after asset manager BlackRock launched its Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund for USD. As soon as BlackRock announced its venture into RWAs, several projects involved in the sector witnessed a significant hike in prices.

Interestingly, the $10 trillion asset manager saw 10,000 worth of RIO tokens transferred to a wallet related to its new fund. The token witnessed a 47% surge in prices in a matter of hours after the transfer.

‼️ By now, everyone has heard of the “BlackRock Wallet” that was recently funded w/ $100M in $USDC.

According to crypto analyst Xremlin, RWA tokenization could grow into a whopping $16 trillion market by 2023.

“Blackrock’s entry will accelerate growth beyond your wildest dreams,” the analyst wrote.

Along with some other RWA-based projects, Xremlin expects RIO will benefit from this trend. The analyst projected the token could see massive growth as high as 100X in the 2024-2025 period. Meanwhile, another analyst going by the moniker CryptoDOC, expects the token to hit “double digits” soon.

At the time of writing, the project’s 24-hour volume was up 105%, and its market cap had also grown more than 24% to $16.7 million."
https://crypto.news/ethereums-co-founder-proposes-new-plan-to-boost-decentralization-in-crypto-staking/,Ethereum’s co-founder proposes new plan to boost decentralization in crypto staking,2024-03-27 09:36:52+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has launched a proposal to enhance the decentralization and fairness of the Ethereum network’s staking process, marking a significant stride in refining the protocol.

Dubbed the “anti-correlation incentive” program, this initiative seeks to penalize what is considered routine mistakes by validators, such as failing to complete an attestation—a process vital for the network’s security and efficiency.

The rationale behind Buterin’s proposal stems from an observation within decentralized systems: errors made by one participant are likely to be mirrored across other nodes or validators controlled by the same entity.

The anti-correlation incentive is designed to discourage such uniformity in errors, thereby fostering a more distributed and robust network structure.

Central to Buterin’s argument is the concern that without such measures, attempts to promote decentralization could inadvertently encourage only a veneer of compliance. Validators might simply appear to diversify without genuinely distributing control or resources, thus maintaining the status quo under the guise of decentralization.

Ethereum already employs penalty mechanisms for serious infractions, known as slashing, but these have historically been reserved for egregious or malicious behavior. The proposed anti-correlation incentive program, however, would integrate penalties into the everyday operations of the network.

The approach aims to address particularly the large stakers operating numerous validators from a singular location or device, which could lead to widespread, correlated failures within the network.

Buterin suggests that the new program would compel these large entities to genuinely diversify their operations, thereby reducing the risk of simultaneous failures while still enabling them to leverage economies of scale. The idea is to balance the scale advantages of large validators with the need for a decentralized and resilient network.

To ensure fairness, the proposal is tailored to impact primarily large validators, with safeguards in place to prevent undue hardship on smaller participants. It ensures that the punitive aspects of the program are directed where they can encourage real change, without disproportionately affecting those with fewer resources.

Speaking at ETHTaipei 2024, which took place from March 21 to 24, Buterin earlier talked about “rainbow staking.” The concept encourages diversity in service providers, attempting to address Ethereum’s centralization issues further.

His concern over centralization was highlighted by the dominance of platforms like Lido Finance, which, at one point, controlled over 70% of Ethereum-staked assets despite these being distributed among numerous validators."

The latest figures bring the total cumulative inflows to these investment products since Jan. 11 to $11.7 billion, resulting in collective assets under management (AUM) of $58.755 billion at the reporting time.

These inflows mark the second consecutive day of positive capital flows this week after a previous week of consistent outflows. Notably, throughout last week, the spot Bitcoin ETF market saw funds flow out of it, totaling $887.6 million, as the crypto market’s retracement heated up.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded five consecutive days of outflows for the first time since they began trading, with $362.2 million in negative flows on March 19 marking the single largest intraday outflow witnessed by these products.

The outflows were due to a confluence of reduced inflows in the other nine products and sustained outflows from GBTC, which has lost $14.36 billion since Grayscale transformed it to an ETF on Jan. 11.

Bridging protocols such as the CCTP are essential in the on-chain environment, which enables blockchain networks — which generally operate in siloed environments — to communicate with one another, allowing the transfer of digital assets across various ecosystems.

Traditional bridging solutions often have a handful of drawbacks, such as introducing additional trust assumptions and requiring users to pay significant gas fees.

The request comes as part of a proposed final judgment submitted to Judge Analisa Torres on Monday. The SEC’s proposed penalty comprises $876 million in disgorgement, $198 million in prejudgment interest, and an additional $876 million as a civil penalty.

The heart of the SEC’s argument is the alleged “severity and pervasiveness of Ripple’s misconduct,” emphasizing the necessity of a “strong deterrent message” not only to Ripple but also to other entities contemplating public capital raising through unregistered crypto-asset transactions. This stance was outlined in the court filing, highlighting the regulatory body’s concerns over maintaining market integrity.

Ripple has been at odds with the SEC for several years following accusations from the agency that Ripple raised $1.3 billion via sales of XRP, which the SEC deems an unregistered security.

In a partial victory for Ripple last year, Judge Torres found that certain XRP sales, termed “programmatic,” did not breach securities laws thanks to a blind bid process. However, she sided with the SEC regarding direct sales to institutional investors, classifying them as securities transactions.

The ESMA has submitted the report to the 27-member bloc’s executive arm, the European Commission. According to ESMA, the commission “will provide further advice and technical guidance in this area if requested.”

https://twitter.com/EBA_News/status/1767849974417576380?s=20

The report covers essential key policies such as the information required for the authorization of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), the process for financial entities to notify their intent to offer crypto-asset services, standards for assessing noteworthy acquisitions in CASPs, and the mechanisms for handling complaints within such entities.

One of the report’s main goals is to ensure a level playing field for all market participants, promoting fair competition among CASPs. The primary focal point will be enhancing investor protection throughout the EU.

The Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group of ESMA has supported this goal. The group has advocated for equal regulatory scrutiny for both traditional financial intermediaries and those providing crypto-asset services.

To further this objective, the group has also recommended a “two-track approach” for the notification and authorization processes. This strategy will reportedly streamline the regulatory requirements for all entities involved.

Further, the ESMA has also announced its third consultation package. The consultation is seeking public feedback on proposed rules targeting the detection and reporting of suspected market abuse in the crypto sector.

It will also evaluate policies for crypto-asset transfer services and establish suitability requirements for certain crypto-asset services. Additionally, the consultation looks to enhance ICT operational resilience for firms under MiCA.

The ESMA will be accepting comments till June 25, 2024. Meanwhile, the European Banking Authority (EBA) has been actively consulting on MiCA regulation measures since its finalization in 2023. The agency also collaborated with the ESMA earlier in March to announce draft regulations for multi-currency stablecoins issuers."

The Haeundae Police Station in Busan, South Korea, caught two people in their 20s and 30s for defrauding a senior citizen and taking 5.5 billion South Korean won in various transactions.

According to a local source, the victim was promised significant profits on cryptocurrency investments from September to December 2022.

The scammers guaranteed 70% earnings for a monthly investment of 1 billion won. The police quoted the scammers as saying:

“It’s a boom period for coin (cryptocurrency). If you invest 1 billion won, I will call it 1.7 billion won a month later.”

The victim handed the scammers 5.5 billion won in total across six transactions, which they subsequently falsified balance certificates to use as proof of investment.

During the scam, the victim was provided fake balance sheets for cryptocurrency investments and real estate contracts.

South Korean police claimed the fake balance sheet showed 20 billion won in cryptocurrency, despite the fact that none of the victim’s 5.5 billion won funds were sent to the crypto trading account.

Meanwhile, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, South Korea’s most notorious cryptocurrency entrepreneur, was reportedly released from prison in Montenegro on March 23 following extradition requests from the United States and South Korea.

Kwon is currently facing court accusations related to the Terra ecosystem’s collapse in 2022. Darko Vukcevic, the prison director, reportedly said over the phone:

“Do Kwon was released as his sentence for using fraudulent documents concluded. Being a non-national and due to the confiscation of his documents, he was escorted to the police department for foreigners for further proceedings.”

The decision to release Kwon was apparently made by the Supreme Court Council, which is scheduled to consider a judgment that might grant or deny extradition to his native South Korea.

At the time of writing, Crypto.news couldn’t identify the full list of the alliance members. According to its official website, only Binance and CODE (a group formed by Korean crypto exchanges Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit) are listed as the alliance’s partners.

GTR claims it will obtain the relevant information of both the sender and recipient “once a transaction request above the set threshold has been made.” However, the alliance doesn’t specify the threshold, saying “different jurisdictions have different transaction threshold amounts.” For example, FATF suggests $1,000 in USD/EUR as a starting point, but individual countries have the flexibility to implement their own thresholds (e.g., $3,000 in the U.S.).

The surge in TON’s price follows a set of positive developments surrounding the project dun in large part to its association with Telegram, the cloud messaging platform founded by the Durov brothers and one of the mostly widely used messaging applications in the world.

One significant factor behind the price surge appears to be Telegram’s plan to go public with a valuation of $30 billion. Although the exact timeline is uncertain, this announcement propelled TON’s price from $2.78 to $4.46.

Furthermore, the Binance cryptocurrency exchange announced the introduction of perpetual futures trading for TON, further fueling investor interest in the token.

https://crypto.news/grayscale-clo-anticipates-sec-approval-for-spot-ether-etfs-by-may/,Grayscale CLO anticipates SEC approval for spot Ether ETFs by May,2024-03-26 10:37:52+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","Grayscale’s chief legal officer (CLO), Craig Salm, expects the SEC to approve spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by May 2024.

According to Salm, the optimism stems from the SEC’s meetings with Grayscale prior to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. The meetings covered critical operational aspects such as creation/redemption procedures, cash versus in-kind contributions, authorized participants (APs), liquidity providers (LPs), and custody issues.

Based on these interactions, Salm asserts that the case for Ethereum ETFs is quite similar to that of Bitcoin ETFs. His argument mainly centered on the fact that many of the previously resolved issues for Bitcoin ETFs are directly applicable to Ethereum ETFs. That’s because the primary difference between the two products is the underlying assets.

“In many ways, the SEC already has engaged and issuers simply have less to engage on this time,” Salm wrote.

Salm also recalled the recent approval of Ether Futures ETFs and their classification as commodity futures. According to the Grayscale CLO, this was another argument for a favorable regulatory outcome.

He believes the high correlation between futures and spot products strengthens the case for the latter’s approval.

Further, Salm highlighted that these sentiments have already been echoed by other industry insiders like Paul Grewal. The chief legal officer for Coinbase has argued that there was “no good reason” for the SEC to deny ETH ETP applications. His stance was based on statements from several SEC officials who claimed that ETH was not a security measure.

“We hope they won’t try to invent one by questioning the long established regulatory status of ETH, which the SEC has repeatedly endorsed. That’s not how the law works,” Grewal wrote back then.

However, not all industry observers share Salm’s optimism.

Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have voiced concerns over the SEC’s “lack of engagement,” reducing their expectations for an approved spot Ether ETF in May to a pessimistic 25%. Balchunas perceives this stance as intentional rather than mere “procrastination.”

As of now, the SEC has received filings from BlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Hashdex. The deadline for VanECK’s application is set for May 23."

According to a press release shared with crypto.news, a new eBTC system has launched offering users the ability to secure loans without encountering any interest, repayment, or initiation fees. Instead, the protocol utilizes the Ethereum collateral by staking it with Lido to generate staking rewards, which potentially offers a more cost-effective borrowing option.

The protocol aims to enhance existing wrapped Bitcoin assets by leveraging staked ETH (stETH) from Lido and simultaneously introduce an approach to collateralization that gets rid of the necessity of cross-chain bridges.

In addition to addressing risks linked with bridges, eBTC provides customizable collateralization ratios and implements mechanisms to liquidate positions should the collateral value dip below the required threshold, set at a minimum of 110%.

The partnership also includes an incentive program offered by Lido’s Liquidity Observation Lab (LOL), granting additional stETH rewards to early adopters of eBTC, per the press release. These rewards are designed to be distributed without fees, further motivating early engagement.

Lido dominates the staking scene on Ethereum as the largest liquid staking protocol, boasting a TVL of $35.12 billion, per DeFi Llama data. Meanwhile, BadgerDAO, with $3.5 billion in BTC deposits, leads the Bitcoin defi sector.

Despite the innovative approach, users still contend with inherent challenges and risks within synthetic stablecoins and the broader defi ecosystem. Regulatory ambiguity, counterparty risk, and volatility remain critical considerations.

The defi market has encountered vulnerabilities such as smart contract exploits and market manipulations, jeopardizing the stability and security of protocols. For instance, SushiSwap suffered a $3.3 million loss due to a smart contract incident last April. In 2022, the defi sector experienced a total of $2.7 billion in losses from smart contract hacks."

Bitcoin (BTC) is unlikely to trade below the $20,000 mark in the current cycle, as a cohort of long-term holders has been heavily buying the crypto since early February 2023, when BTC was trading above $24,000, analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex said in a recent research report.

With Bitcoin currently trading around $70,600, analysts highlight the short-term holder realized price standing at $55,834, indicating its critical role as a “crucial dynamic support/resistance level throughout this cycle.”

“Regardless of whether we see BTC move lower, we do not expect a V-shaped recovery as has been the case for previous dips since 2023.” Bitfinex

The analysts anticipate that any decline to $56,000 would align with the maximum downturn from a new local high to the bottom, totaling approximately 23-24%.

Bitfinex noted that recent data from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) showed net negative flows for the first time last week, with each trading day reporting a net negative flow.

Global financial messaging network SWIFT is planning to launch a new platform within the next one to two years to integrate the forthcoming wave of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) with the existing financial system, a spokesperson for SWIFT told Reuters.

With approximately 90% of the world’s central banks exploring digital currency options, SWIFT’s initiative underscores a collective effort to keep pace with advancements in crypto like Bitcoin while grappling with technological intricacies.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.

BOON, an ERC-20 meme coin released by the Base Baboon team, presents a distinctive proposition in the meme coin arena. It capitalizes on the BASE blockchain to deliver deflationary advantages and improved liquidity for investors.

Exploring Base Baboon (BOON)

Base Baboon has emerged as a compelling player in the vibrant world of cryptocurrency and meme coins.

BOON is a digital asset and meme coin on the Base Layer-2 Ethereum network that combines humor, community, and cutting-edge blockchain technology, ensuring compatibility with various decentralized applications and exchanges.

Its supply is limited, fostering scarcity and potential value appreciation. The coin leverages meme culture to engage a broader audience, potentially increasing its popularity and adoption.

Unlike many meme coins, BOON stands out due to its deflationary nature and innovative liquidity features.

BOON’s primary appeal lies in its deflationary mechanism. With each buy or sell transaction, 1% of the token is burned, gradually reducing the total supply. This creates scarcity and the potential for value appreciation over time.

Additionally, BOON incorporates a 1% liquidity generator which is aimed at maintaining strong liquidity pools. As more users engage in trading BOON, this feature ensures there is sufficient liquidity in the market, enhancing trading stability.

In terms of investor protection, Base Baboon is developing the BOON Bot for its Telegram channel.

This tool will allow users to analyze BASE Smart contracts quickly, helping them differentiate between legitimate projects and potential scams by examining contract details and liquidity lock status. Access to the BOON Bot requires holding a minimum of $200 worth of BOON tokens.

The BOON tokenomics

The team is positioned to achieve a $1 billion market cap, leveraging its strategic tokenomics, continuous development efforts, and robust marketing strategy.

The total supply of BOON stands at 420,690,000,000, with allocations of 5% to developers, 5% to marketing, and an initial burn of 10%.

Moreover, the coin facilitates fast, low-cost transactions. Upon its launch, Baboon ($BOON) will be accessible on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

Emphasizing the pivotal role of the community, BOON fosters regular engagement, support, and social media campaigns.

ATIC Third International Investment Company LLC, linked to the United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, plans to secure nearly $500 million worth of FTX’s interest in Anthropic. This move came to light through a recent court document filed at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

Additionally, Jane Street, various Fidelity Management and Research-managed funds, and the venture capital entity HOF Capital, among 20 other entities, have agreed to acquire stakes.

In 2021, FTX made a significant investment of $500 million in AI startup Anthropic, only to face bankruptcy the following year due to fraud charges. Since last year, Anthropic’s value has rapidly increased with the developments surrounding generative AI and the prospect of the firm rivaling OpenAI.

Given that FTX’s holding in Anthropic ranks among the most lucrative assets within its portfolio, and with the estate’s cash reserves reported at roughly $6.4 billion previously, FTX officials are optimistic that creditors will fully recover their dues.

Previously, there were reports of interest from Saudi Arabia-based buyers. However, Anthropic executives revealed that Saudi investments were disregarded due to national security matters."

According to Max Minton, Goldman’s Asia Pacific head of digital assets, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs has significantly influenced this trend.

“The recent ETF approval has triggered a resurgence of interest and activities from our clients. Many of our largest clients are active or exploring getting active in the space,” Minton said in a release.

Goldman Sachs, which introduced its cryptocurrency trading desk in 2021, offers its clients various crypto-related services. These include cash-settled Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) option trading and futures trading for these cryptocurrencies on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. However, the firm does not directly trade the actual crypto tokens.

“It was a quieter year last year, but we’ve seen a pickup in interest from clients in onboarding, pipeline, and volume since the start of the year,” Minton said, considering the market trends.

The renewed interest primarily stems from Goldman’s traditional client base, which is predominantly hedge funds. Nonetheless, the bank is broadening its horizon to accommodate a diverse clientele, including asset managers, bank clients, and a select group of digital asset firms.

Goldman’s clients utilize crypto derivatives multifacetedly, encompassing directional bets, yield enhancement, and hedging strategies. While Bitcoin-related products remain the primary focus, the potential approval of Ether ETFs in the United States could shift the interest toward Ether-related products.

Beyond trading, Goldman Sachs is pioneering digital asset space by tokenizing traditional assets using blockchain technology. The bank has developed a digital asset platform, GS DAP, and has conducted pilot tests on a blockchain network to facilitate connectivity among banks, asset managers, and exchanges.

Goldman is also investing in startups aligning with its strategic vision for the digital asset market, particularly in blockchain infrastructure firms.

“We have a portfolio and will invest if or when it makes strategic sense,” Minton said."

Starting April 8, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) will begin accepting listing applications for cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (ETNs). The announcement follows the Exchange’s previous one and marks a significant milestone in integrating digital currencies into the U.K.’s financial market.

Following the applications in April, the LSE will start trading crypto ETNs on May 28, pending approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The inclusion of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs aims to attract a wide array of issuers and investors, similar to what Bitcoin ETFs have achieved in the U.S. since January.

To ensure a smooth launch, the LSE has set deadlines for issuers intending to list their securities. By April 15, they must submit the necessary documentation, including a base prospectus for FCA approval.

Like Bitcoin ETFs, ETNs are traded on a stock exchange, offering a more accessible and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to the crypto market. The critical difference between ETNs and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) is the structure.

ETNs are unsecured debt securities backed by the issuer’s credit, whereas ETFs are funds that hold the actual assets they track, offering direct exposure. This means that ETNs carry a credit risk that ETFs do not, as the value of an ETN depends on the issuer’s ability to pay, while ETFs’ values are directly tied to the assets they own."

The milestone was reached swiftly, with Base surpassing the $1 billion total value locked (TVL) mark on Feb. 27, 226 days after its launch in August, and crossing the $2 billion threshold just 25 days later.

Data from DefiLlama indicate that the rapid accumulation of TVL is a testament to the network’s growing popularity and adoption within the crypto community.

The surge in Base’s TVL is believed to be significantly influenced by the rise of meme coins on its platform, mirroring a recent trend that has benefited the Solana (SOL) network. Meme coins, digital assets that often start as internet jokes but can amass substantial market capitalization, are speculated to be a driving force behind the adoption and growth of the Base network.

Some community members observe a potential shift in interest from Solana to Base, particularly in the context of meme coin trading activities.

On the Base network, meme coins like Degen (DEGEN), Normie (NORMIE), Chad (CHAD), and Brett (BRETT) are gaining traction, though market caps have not yet reached the heights of Solana’s meme coins.

Binance representatives said they are aware of CommEX’s intention to cease operations. The company emphasized that CommEX’s decision does not affect its obligations to Russian users and that the users’ digital assets remain safe.

“Our decision to exit the Russian market remains unchanged, and we are currently in discussions with several service providers regarding the sale of our Russian business.

Kiyosaki, known for his insights on wealth-building and investment, announced his plans to purchase 10 more Bitcoin before April, emphasizing the upcoming Bitcoin halving as a significant event for potential investors.

He suggests that those who cannot afford a whole Bitcoin might consider buying a fraction of one through the Bitcoin ETFs or Satoshis, hinting at the possibility of owning an entire Bitcoin by year’s end if the process unfolds as expected.

The noted author contrasts his prediction with a recommendation for those less inclined towards Bitcoin to invest in silver, specifically U.S. silver eagles. Citing his friend Andy Schectman, Kiyosaki notes the dwindling supply of silver and highlights the difficulties in acquiring junk silver, referring to pre-1964 U.S. silver coins.

I am buying 10 more Bitcoin before April. Why? The “Having.” If you can’t afford a whole Bitcoin you may want to consider buying 1/10 of a coin, via the new ETFs or Satoshi’s.

The backdrop to Kiyosaki’s investment advice is a grim portrayal of the global economic condition. He cites several factors contributing to financial instability, including the United States being the largest debtor nation, China’s faltering property market, Japan’s prolonged economic slump, Germany’s descent into depression, consumers’ reliance on credit cards, troubled banks, and looming global conflict.

Kiyosaki echoes the sentiment of Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, emphasizing the pitfalls of saving in fiat currency, which Saylor derogatorily refers to as fake money.

Echoing the urgency of avoiding financial impoverishment, Kiyosaki, alongside Saylor and Schectman, encourages the acquisition of gold, silver, and Bitcoin. He notes silver’s affordability, making it accessible to a broader audience. Current prices for Bitcoin (BTC) are $70,000, gold is approximately $2,500, and silver is about $35 per coin."

CoinShares experts note that previously, positive dynamics were observed for seven weeks. During this period, inflows into instruments amounted to $12.3 billion. Trade turnover amounted to $28 billion after a record $43 billion the previous week.

The main driver of the negative dynamics was outflows from GBTC from Grayscale for $2 billion. They exceeded net inflows to its competitors ($1.1 billion).

This Canary network will be a “separate network” acting as a dedicated testing ground for new features before they are officially launched on the mainnet.

“The recent finding of a bug in the freshly launched AMM on the XRP Ledger shows the need for better testing. Testing with real value, on a network that isn’t mainnet. Testing when an amendment is available, not when it was voted in and went live,” Wind wrote in an X post on March 25.

The bug, discovered on March 24, resulted in some transactions not executing properly. Wind argues this could have been prevented with more thorough pre-launch testing.

The developer envisions the Canary Network as a sandbox environment that mirrors the main XRP Ledger in functionality but is only used for testing purposes. It would feature a native token with intrinsic value to mimic real-world testing scenarios.

The developer proposed introducing real stablecoins, such as EUR, USD, and USDC, through collaboration with GateHub. This would allow developers and users to simulate tests and even try to exploit the network to weed out possible vulnerabilities.

However, Wind stressed that it would be crucial to maintain a full history like the mainnet and provide wallet and tool support to ensure thorough testing conditions.

Wind also outlined his intention to engage in discussions with the wider XRP community and stakeholders when proceeding with the proposal. Ideal participants would include ecosystem participants, compliance officers, legal advisors, and representatives from various projects to gather insights, identify potential challenges, and explore opportunities.

The concept of a Canary Network is not unique to the XRP Ledger. Several other networks have employed similar testing environments.

Ethereum, for instance, uses multiple testnets, such as Goerli, Holesky, and Sepolia, to thoroughly test upgrades before they are deployed on the mainnet.

Wind’s initiative has been supported by the XRP community. The bug discovered caused several protocols using AMM Pools on the XRP ledger to halt their services. Support from the community stems from concerns about the future of AMMs on XRPL, as the issue was discovered just days after the XRPL AMM went live on March 22."

Autism Capital urged the Ethereum co-founder to “get back on X,” claiming it would have a much greater impact on the project’s development.

Vitalik needs to get back on X. Farcaster isn’t going to win the culture war.

Space X CEO Elon Musk also joined the conversation, inquiring about Buterin’s departure.

“Why did he leave?” asked Musk, prompting a flood of responses from community participants.

One user speculated that Buterin’s decision could have been influenced by the increasing number of bot accounts on the platform. Another user echoed this sentiment, referencing a post from Tyler John from Jan. 2024, discussing the bot issue.



According to John, Buterin’s posts are usually flooded by “sycophants, crypto bots, and followers,” who spam the replies section every time the Ethereum co-founder posts something.

“Vitalik Buterin has to append every reply with “srry 4 ratio-ing” because immediately afterwards a deluge of sycophants, crypto bots, and followers rains down on the post with tickers, memes, and expressions of praise and all the OP can see is #ETH and $SOL for three days,” John wrote.

Buerin agreed to these reasons in response, claiming that this prompted him to do most of his posting on Farcaster.

His pivot to Farcaster was also preceded by a security breach on his X account. The attackers posted malicious phishing links and stole over $690,000 from unsuspecting users.

Farcaster, a decentralized social app protocol, has seen a notable increase in user engagement and developer interest. Buterin has expressed his belief in the platform’s long-term potential, expecting it to remain a significant player in the digital space beyond a mere seasonal trend.

This optimism followed the platform’s notable performance metrics, including a 400% increase in daily active users following the launch of new features like “frames” on its Warpcast application.

According to Dune Analytics, Farcaster’s daily active user count had surged from 5,000 on Jan. 28 to over 24,700 by Feb. 3. The volume of new daily casts also experienced a dramatic rise at the time, marking a 1,000% increase.

However, a Feb. 18 report revealed that Farcaster wasn’t fully bot—and spam-free. Several users have started noticing a drop in conversation quality despite the platform’s growing popularity.

Buterin himself had weighed in on the matter while still considering Farcaster a viable X alternative. He added that addressing the issue of increasing spam was Farcaster’s next challenge."

Fencer highlighted several bots, including BONKbot for Solana transactions, BananaGun for Ethereum and Solana, and Unibot for EVM and, prospectively, Solana platforms.

Each bot requires specific customization, and mastering their use can be challenging but potentially rewarding.

“The longer the narrative in the Top Gainers, the stronger it becomes,” Fencer observed, emphasizing the importance of trending narratives in achieving significant returns with meme coins.

Fencer did, however, warn of the inherent risks associated with meme coin trading. The volatility of these assets, as well as the high risk of fraud, need rigorous due diligence and excellent risk management.

Investors are advised to use platforms like Rug Check and Coin Scan to verify the security of tokens. It’s crucial to acknowledge that not all investments will result in the expected high returns, emphasizing the speculative nature of this trading method.

The crypto asset, often leveraged for gas fees and liquidity provision on the Idex exchange, had witnessed a generally bearish trend over the past two weeks, dropping 30% from $0.0920 on March 13 to a low of $0.0642 on March 20 as the broader market fell.

However, this price slump immediately preceded a recovery push that has now seen the token reclaim a 10-month-high. IDEX saw the start of its good fortunes over the weekend, spiking to a high of $0.0904 on March 23 before retracing on the back of stern resistance.

The asset’s bullish momentum extended to the next day, allowing it to surge to $0.1191 on March 23, as it breached the $0.1 psychological price threshold for the first time since May 2023. IDEX closed March 23 with an impressive 48.24% gain, marking its largest intraday gain in 23 months.

Despite a subsequent 4.48% decline this morning, the asset has retained most of the gains recorded over the weekend. Market data indicates IDEX is up 33% in the last 24 hours, making it one of the top-performing crypto assets within this period.

Notably, details are scant on the possible trigger of the recent surge, but data suggests it may stem from growing demand following a rise in interest. IDEX’s volume has spiked 636% to $171.9 million over the past 24 hours, with Binance commanding 66% of the global volume.

Google Trends data also indicates that searches for IDEX have skyrocketed since March 23, with interest over time rising from 23 to 92 as of 14:00 UTC on March 24. Interest has dropped since then, but remains fairly higher compared to the seven-day average.

Significantly, IDEX’s derivatives volume has also increased by 1,364% in the last 24 hours to $784.53 million at the reporting time, with Open Interest (OI) rising 508% to $35.67 million, according to Coinglass data. The asset currently trades for $0.1111, looking to hold above the $0.11 territory despite the prevailing bearish action."

As the craze around meme coins keeps unfolding, the spotlight now shifts to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a sector experiencing renewed interest following a period of subdued activity.

NFT Price Floor co-founder Nicolás Lallement shared with crypto.news his perspective on the current state of NFTs, saying the market is “already seeing signs” of their comeback. Lallement, the head of the analytical website focused on NFT-related data, underscored the signs of a digital collectibles’ resurgence, pointing to recent notable sales such as two Alien Punks fetching $16 million each within the past fortnight and a record-breaking sale of Autoglyphs totaling $14.6 million in February.

“So yes, I think NFTs will come back 100%, we are already seeing signs of that. […] The ongoing bull market plus the potential l2 summer we are going to enter are the perfect combination for a comeback of quality NFTs in all fronts.” Nicolás Lallement

Speaking of meme coins, Lallement emphasized the unique value proposition of digital collectibles, citing their “compelling, richer and more sophisticated” storytelling capabilities. He noted that while meme coins may garner temporary speculative interest, NFTs offer deeper, richer experiences rooted in their uniqueness.

“I would say that the main difference is that NFTs are unique objects and that makes them way more sophisticated, superior in terms storytelling.” Nicolás Lallement

Moreover, Lallement highlighted emerging trends in blockchain development aimed at bridging the gap between NFTs and meme coins, noting the ERC-404 standard popularized by Pandora as an example of this convergence.

The NFT Price Floor co-founder also pointed to the recent launch of NFT Pulse, an analytical platform developed by venture firm Electric Capital, as a “sign of the growing interest regarding NFTs.” As crypto.news reported earlier, the California-based venture capital firm unveiled a new analytical platform designed to address the scarcity of cross-chain data and transparency within the turnover of digital collectibles."

The smart contract bug emerged shortly after the contract’s introduction on March 18, aimed at improving swapping efficiency and reducing gas fees. However, the contract contained a critical vulnerability, allowing hackers to drain funds when approved.

The ParaSwap team reported on X on March 24 that all assets recovered by white hat hackers had been returned, and permissions to AugustusV6 were revoked.

White hack recovery update: Assets have been returned to wallets which have revoked their permissions



If your wallet had assets transferred to 0x66e90d840d7c4f3473e25dd8ca361747058c6db0 and have not received them yet, your wallet is still vulnerable, PLEASE REVOKE ALL RELEVANT… https://t.co/zraj3tSFNe — ParaSwap (@paraswap) March 24, 2024

The team further noted that 213 addresses have yet to revoke their allowances to the compromised contract.

Revocation of a smart contract generally involves discontinuing or disabling its blockchain operations, which effectively hinders the contract’s capability to retrieve the user’s wallet and tokens.

The vulnerability was first discovered on March 20, with the platform responding by pausing its application programming interface (API) and securing at-risk funds through a white hat hack. The involvement of white hat hackers helped avert massive asset loss.

“Actively engaged in identifying hacker addresses and tracing the movement of the funds,” ParaSwap states in close collaboration with blockchain analytics and security firms Chainalysis and TRM Labs.

The group also said that they had started talking to the hackers through on-chain messages and urged them to return the stolen user funds.

If there’s no response by March 27, ParaSwap plans to pursue recovery through legal means.

At the time, the losses were allegedly minor, with preliminary data suggesting that the hackers got away with just $24,000 before the vulnerability was identified.

On Mar. 22, Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British-Kenyan who is Binance‘s regional manager for Africa, reportedly fled Nigeria after being detained upon arrival in the country as part of an investigation into the exchange.

Anjarwalla, who was detained in Nigeria, reportedly departed from Abuja via a Middle Eastern airline following permission to visit a nearby mosque for prayers during Ramadan, according to a report from Premium Times, a Nigerian online newspaper. An immigration official, speaking to the media, claimed Anjarwalla used a Kenyan passport to leave Nigeria, raising questions about how exactly the Binance executive obtained the passport as he possessed no other travel documents when taken into custody.

The recent development comes after the Nigerian government started legal proceedings in the Federal High Court in Abuja, levying a four-count charge against Binance Holdings, Anjarwalla, and Tigran Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen and Binance’s head of financial crime compliance, who was detained alongside Anjarwalla by Nigerian authorities.

The charges allege that the accused parties provided services to platform subscribers without proper registration with the Federal Inland Revenue Service to fulfill tax obligations. Gambaryan continues to be held in custody as the local court has deferred its decision on the matter until April 5.

The detention appears to be part of Nigeria’s efforts to stabilize the naira and combat currency speculation, which the local authorities believe, is fueled by crypto exchanges. Previously, the Nigerian government ordered telecom and internet service providers to restrict access to several crypto exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, in an attempt to address currency depreciation. In response, Binance removed the naira for trading from its platform."
https://crypto.news/kelexo-presale-attracts-dai-and-internet-computer-whales/,Kelexo presale attracts DAI and Internet Computer whales,2024-03-25 07:13:52+00:00,,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.

Kelexo (KLXO), a new defi project is emerging as an attractive lending platform, drawing the attention of Dai (DAI) and Internet Computer (ICP) investors.

Changing trends are a big part of trading and cryptocurrency trading is not an exemption. Investors have always moved with the tides to keep their heads above water. Good investors take advantage of changing trends to search out means to better their positions and ward off risks in the event of a market crash

In our analysis, we observe the performance of two tokens, Dai and Internet Computer.

Slow and steady for DAI

Dai remains a go-to token for investors, given that it is pegged to the US Dollar. As of the time of writing, 1 Dai is at par with 1 USD. Little to no changes can be observed from its performance over 30 days, as only a slight 0.01% adjustment was recorded.

Dai’s stability provides security for investors, but much is left to be desired in terms of growth. The token’s only utility appears to be a sanctuary for the often volatile market. Investors could certainly do much better than Dai.

Highs and lows for Internet Computer (ICP)

Unlike Dai, the Internet Computer token demonstrates turbulence. In the last 30 days, it has been uphill and downhill again for Internet Computer, peaking at $16.30 and crashing to $11. At the time of writing, Internet Computer is at $12.80, trading 18% worse than a week ago. A 30-day average of $13.5 is indicative of a future positive trend, but there are no promises.

Nevertheless, the Internet Computer cryptocurrency is doing well despite changes in the market. It’s staying strong even when prices fluctuate. This indicates investor confidence, which could lead to it reaching $16 or more, but investors should be wary of fake movements and market pressure. While signs remain good, investors have to be extra cautious given the increased volatility in the market.

Promising lending strategy

Kelexo is a decentralized Web3 marketplace facilitating direct interaction between loan lenders and borrowers. It eliminates the need for intermediaries, enabling users to list loans and engage in transactions without delays. With instant payouts and lower transaction fees than traditional platforms, Kelexo offers a seamless and cost-effective lending experience.

Kelexo presents opportunities for borrowers and investors alike. For borrowers, Kelexo presents the opportunity to access needed funds directly from a lender, without unreasonable transaction costs, cumbersome procedures, and lower interest rates.

Kelexo token has the potential of hitting 10x of its current presale value of $0.05. The presale is at stage two. Expectedly, payments are based on holdings, so bigger investments equal bigger ROI.

Inevitably, DAI and Internet Computer investors may ape in on Kelexo to benefit from this lending strategy.

https://crypto.news/bitcoin-is-winning-microstrategy-chair-michael-saylor/,‘Bitcoin is winning’ says MicroStrategy chair Michael Saylor,2024-03-24 20:39:21+00:00,"Julius Mutunkei, Anthony Patrick","Prominent Bitcoin (BTC) advocate and MicroStrategy Inc. chair Michael Saylor shared a chart on Saturday, March 23 comparing Bitcoin’s performance with traditional assets like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, gold, silver, and bonds.

Saylor took it as an opportunity to assert Bitcoin’s supremacy in the investment landscape.

According to the chart, Bitcoin has grown 432% in that time, compared to 56% for the S&P 500 and 50% for Nasdaq.

Conversely, silver and bonds have performed dismally, losing 13% and 19% of their value, respectively, while gold registered a modest 7% gain.

‘Volatility is vitality’

Following Bitcoin’s meteoric rise to a record high of $73,797 on March 14, the digital currency experienced a subsequent decline of nearly 12%, sparking debates within the cryptocurrency community.

Saylor, renowned for his bullish stance on Bitcoin, took to social media to share his perspective on the market’s volatility.

Volatility, in his view, equals “vitality.” The fluctuating prices are integral to the market’s dynamics, Saylor argues, portraying them as a natural phenomenon rather than a cause for alarm.

Volatility is Vitality. — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) March 21, 2024

Under Saylor’s guidance, MicroStrategy has solidified its commitment to Bitcoin, significantly increasing its holdings.

In a recent press release, the company disclosed the acquisition of over 9,000 BTC between March 11 and 18, financed through a combination of convertible senior notes offerings and company cash reserves.

This latest purchase comes on the heels of the company’s successful private offering, which raised $603.75 million.

With this influx of funds, MicroStrategy seized the opportunity to bolster its Bitcoin treasury reserves, now totaling approximately 214,246 BTC at an average price of $35,160 per Bitcoin.

Peter Schiff counters

However, not everyone shares Saylor’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin. Economist Peter Schiff, known for his skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, expressed concerns regarding Saylor’s approach to Bitcoin investment.

Following Saylor’s announcement of MicroStrategy’s latest BTC buy, Schiff cautioned against the high-risk nature of aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, citing the volatile nature of digital currencies as a potential pitfall.

Despite Saylor’s assertive leveraged purchasing, Schiff noted that Bitcoin remained down by 15% from its peak at the time.

Yet despite your reckless leveraged buying, Bitcoin is still down 15% from its high price just five days ago. Now that you're done buying the bottom can really drop out of the market. When Bitcoin hits 20K MSTR will be down $3.25 billion. At 10K MSTR will be down $5.5 billion. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 19, 2024

He cautioned against further market downturns now that Saylor appears to have completed his buying spree, suggesting that the market could experience a significant drop.

Schiff projected potential losses for MicroStrategy, stating that if Bitcoin plummeted to $20,000, the company could incur losses totaling $3.25 billion, escalating to $5.5 billion if the coin’s price dropped to $10,000."

ZigZag founder Kedar Iyer called out ZKasino founders on X, saying: “They would claim they were taking money out to pay developers for building the ZigZag frontend, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino.”

I'm gonna lay this out since it gets worse and worse everyday.

ZKasino founders, specifically Derivatives Monke, were responsible for the ZigZag fundraising, where $15 million was raised and went into addresses controlled by ZKasino founders.

“I never had control of that money, so it is possible more of that money was stolen or went into ZKasino than I was aware of,” said Iyer.

Iyer alleges that “market making” TerraUSD (UST) against his recommendation and leverage trading on FTX contributed to lost funds.

This is fun time to mention the 2nd part of the fraud.

Kedar further stated that he previously demanded recompensation for about $1 million, which went into funding ZKasino to no avail. Therefore, ZigZag token holders should attempt to get restitution on their own.

Moreover, he said that multiple former ZKasino employees and contractors had contacted him with claims that they hadn’t been paid for their work.

Iyer blamed the failure of ZigZag on Derivatives Monke’s “incompetence,” stating that he has been unable to develop ZigZag further because he ruined the fundraising and destroyed the project.

However, let's address a question: Who should be held responsible for the failure of Zigzag?

One ZigZag employee, by the username Feichi, defended Derivatives Monke, and clapped back at Iyer, saying he has “a lazy attitude towards work.”

The glitch has disrupted transactions within these pools. The RippleX team has alerted users through a post on X, advising against new fund deposits into AMM pools. Those holding liquidity provider (LP) tokens have been advised to withdraw their funds till the issue is sorted.

These preventive measures are a bid to avoid further complications due to the gitch.

AMM pools serve as liquidity sources in decentralized exchanges (DEXs). They allow asset trading without traditional order books. Traders can swap assets with the pool without involving another user. The pools hold various asset reserves.

The glitch impacts transaction execution in some AMM pools on XRPL, causing them to be processed incorrectly. As such, the basic functionalities of the pool are crippled, necessitating swift resolution.

The developers are currently collaborating with community members to actively work on resolving the glitch.

The issue has prompted several XRPL pool-utilizing projects to suspend their connections. Sologenic, a platform for trading tokenized stocks on the XRPL, halted deposits following RippleX’s announcement. Anodos, known for its XRPL interface AnodoSwap, also disabled its service.

Community reactions have been mixed.

Some users voiced concerns about the network’s reliability following the glitch. One user expressed their frustration regarding the situation, claiming that the “chain is dead.” However, others were a bit more supportive, with some lauding the RippleX team for their transparency on the matter.

The XRPL AMM went live on March 22 after the XLS-30D amendment was passed on Jan. 31. According to XRPScan, this new feature led to the creation of over 1,000 liquidity pools, significantly diversifying the assets available. Among these, one of the largest liquidity pools is the PCSH/XCASH pair. The AMM account for this pair, known as “rM8W….cX1h,” boasts a balance of 13,136,629,099.06384 LPToken.

David Schwartz, Ripple’s CTO, described the launch as the start of a “longer road” from the initial rollout to upcoming milestones.

The complications have arisen despite rigorous testing by the RippleX developers. Back in Jan., the team reported discovering an “issue” that could prevent the immediate execution of AMM transactions. The issue arose when the trading fees were set below the minimum threshold of 0.01%."

According to Bloomberg, SunnySide Digital — a wholesaler in the crypto mining industry — is sending approximately 6,000 older Bitcoin mining machines to a warehouse it operates in Colorado Springs.

The company plans to refurbish and resell these machines to buyers overseas, especially in regions with cheaper energy costs.

SunnySide Digital CEO Taras Kulyk said the decision is a natural response to the halving event. Buyers are seeking locations where electricity expenses are minimal. Countries such as Ethiopia, Tanzania, Paraguay, and Uruguay are emerging as key players in the global mining landscape due to their favorable energy costs.

Price volatility and equipment upgrades

The halving event, ingrained in Bitcoin’s protocol by its anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, aims to control the total supply of Bitcoin by reducing the mining reward by half approximately every four years. With the reward set to drop to 3.125 Bitcoin from the current 6.25, miners are under pressure to optimize their operations.

Despite the challenges posed by the halving, Bitcoin’s value has seen significant growth and is currently priced at $65,770, although a few thousand dollars down from its recent all-time high peak of $73,750 attained on March 14.

Analysts like Michael van de Poppe have described this correction as a case of pre-halving peaking and have predicted the cryptocurrency could hit new all-time highs.

However, continued use of outdated equipment could lead to electricity costs outweighing mining revenue, necessitating a shift towards more efficient hardware.

In response to these dynamics, some mining firms are strategically relocating their operations to regions with lower electricity costs. Nuo Xu, a miner with sites in Texas, is exploring opportunities in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and other countries, drawn by the prospect of reduced overhead costs.

While some equipment remains in the U.S. due to logistical and shareholder considerations, many mining companies are investing heavily in new hardware.

Major players in the industry have collectively ordered over $1 billion worth of machines since February 2023, signaling a commitment to adapt to the evolving landscape of Bitcoin mining."

In a series of tweets, Gün Sirer expressed concern over the tendency within the crypto community to overlook red flags in favor of individuals (i.e., disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried) who initially appear successful.

Hey y'all,

Many L2 platforms utilize centralized sequencers without fraud proofs, echoing manipulative tactics seen with some of Bankman-Fried’s ventures.

“The next cycle is going to be even more noisy, with even worse behavior. It has become really easy to launch a trash L2, and it’s fairly easy to do that trick, perfected by a certain chain that reorgs every other day, where you find someone who is actually doing real work and you parrot what they say, while angling for a photo op with [Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin],” Gün Sirer said.

Inferior L2 solutions can be launched with ease, often employing deceptive practices such as selling tokens pre-launch or manipulating token valuations, he warned. Therefore, it’s important to identify critical red flags associated with these “trash L2s” — discrepancies between project narratives and technological capabilities, token dumping by founders, and overly restrictive token supply tactics.

To navigate through the noise in the crypto market, Gün Sirer proposed a simple litmus test: whether a project addresses significant obstacles facing the industry and offers genuinely innovative solutions. He urged vigilance and critical thinking to prevent the emergence of new bad actors in the wake of Bankman-Fried’s downfall.

Reacting to Gün Sirer’s remarks, Robert Sasu, a core developer at MultiversX, underscored the importance of decentralization, security, and proper design in blockchain projects.

Decentralisation, security and correct construction by design matters. A lot of L2s miss most of these points. I can agree with your worlds, but don’t forget other ecosystem who scale at least as much if not more: like MultiversX.

Meanwhile, another X user with the handle @nextalphaa countered Gün Sirer’s critique of Ethereum (ETH) L2 solutions, arguing that the permissionless nature of Ethereum allows for diverse projects to emerge. He encouraged following the journey towards maximum decentralization and transparency in the L2 space.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Prime Minister Jakobsdóttir outlined her vision, emphasizing the importance of enhancing food independence and establishing a broader grid for renewable energy distribution across households and industries.

The country is known for producing copious amounts of energy from its network of hydroelectric and geothermal plants and stands as the world’s largest energy producer per capita. This has propelled it into a leading position in Bitcoin (BTC) hash rate production.

Iceland shift

Estimates from Bitcoin mining services provider Luxor indicate that the Icelandic Bitcoin mining industry devours approximately 120 megawatts (MW) of electricity.

With a population of just 370,000, the volcanic island stands out as the most Bitcoin-mining-dense country worldwide, attracting miners seeking optimal conditions for their operations.

However, despite this accolade, Jakobsdóttir’s strategic shift, aimed at bolstering food production and enhancing energy sustainability, signals a departure from Iceland’s crypto-centric energy focus towards a more diversified and sustainable approach, where fields of corn take precedence over the hum of crypto mining rigs.

The Prime Minister’s decision is not only driven by concerns over energy sustainability but also by practical considerations. Iceland’s reliance on imported corn has been highlighted as a vulnerability, particularly during power shortages in winter, forcing some industries to resort to non-renewable energy sources.

Jakobsdóttir deems this reliance on imports unacceptable and aims to rectify it by fostering domestic corn cultivation through a proposed farm funding system.

Currently, Iceland produces a mere 1% of its grain and 43% of its vegetables domestically, underscoring the need for agricultural development to enhance food security and reduce dependency on imports.

Iceland’s rethink of its crypto mining space comes amidst reports that Bitcoin miners are ramping up their investments in equipment and consuming record-breaking amounts of energy in readiness for the upcoming Bitcoin halving slated for sometime in April.

At the same time, the Canadian province of British Columbia is reinforcing a 2022 moratorium to manage its electricity supply in the face of growing demands from Bitcoin miners.

Thanks to a British Columbia Supreme Court judge, the province will continue to ban any new crypto mining concern, based on the potentially significant impact such operations may have on its energy resources."

Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe took to X to state that the current consolidation is a case of “peaking pre-halving,” and there is still time for Bitcoin to hit a new all-time high.

The consolidation on #Bitcoin continues.



I don't think we'll see much spectacle coming from Bitcoin; if we do, it will need to break $70.3K.



Above, there is time for new ATHs, but I suspect we're still seeing the case of peaking pre-halving.



Just like any other cycle. pic.twitter.com/1N1Z0JW4sj — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) March 22, 2024

Bitcoin has experienced nearly a 2.6% price drop over the past week and 4% in the last fortnight. According to Van de Poppe, this could be due to the upcoming halving event.

He said that like every other cycle, we are yet to see Bitcoin peak before the halving, adding that we might not see much “spectacle” coming from Bitcoin unless it hits $70,300.

Bitcoin halving is an automatic process that reduces miner rewards by half. Halving occurs every four years, or after 210,000 blocks of Bitcoin are mined. The next halving event is expected to take place in April 2024.

Van de Poppe compared Bitcoin’s price action to the 2016–2017 cycle, suggesting that history will repeat itself and Bitcoin will experience a significant upward trend.

“My main thesis is that we’ve seen the pre-halving hype and that we’re going to have a long, massive bull market.”

In some way, the price action of #Bitcoin is comparable to the 2016-2017 cycle.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital suggests that this year’s Bitcoin pre-halving correction has already begun. Bitcoin pre-halving retraces typically occur 14–28 days before the halving event.

Speaking during an interview at the Digital Asset Summit in London, Das stated that Bitcoin ETFs, which are restricted in the UK, can offer investors an opportunity to make decent returns.

“The UK has always said it wants to be a crypto hub. And this is one of the basic fundamentals potentially for meeting that definition,” said Das.

He added that restrictions against the product in the UK may result in investors seeking them out in unregulated jurisdictions, which may not be good for them or the UK.

Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to get exposure to the value of Bitcoin (BTC), without directly owning the cryptocurrency.

ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, and their value rises when the underlying asset’s price increases, or falls if it decreases.

Back in 2021, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) banned the retail sale of digital asset derivatives, including exchange-traded products (ETPs) that were backed by crypto.

However, Das argues that since then, the financial landscape has changed dramatically from a regulatory perspective. He stated that Bitcoin ETFs could reduce regulatory concerns since the investor doesn’t directly own the underlying asset.

FCA opening up to crypto ETFs?

The UK recently approved the launch of crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs), however, they will only be available to institutional investors and not for retail. This is unlike Bitcoin ETFs in the US, which are available to anyone.

Observers feel the move signaled an openness by the FCA, allowing recognized investment exchanges to list these products for trading. However, the regulatory body remains cautious, warning that retail investors may face significant risks associated with crypto derivatives and ETNs.

Das highlighted the massive adoption of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. after the SEC approval in January, stating that it legitimized Bitcoin in the crypto market, more broadly for institutions.

Coinbase UK CEO Daniel Seifert supports Das’ view on bringing Bitcoin ETFs to the UK, stating that it is better when consumers have more options.

The FCA now faces a balancing act between fostering innovation in the crypto space and protecting retail investors from potential harm.

But with the recent influx of investments into crypto ETFs, exemplified by billions in net inflows, there’s a growing interest in expanding access to crypto investment products."

https://twitter.com/echo_pbreyer/status/1771151729771298974

EU legislation

The legislation targets transactions from private, unregistered crypto wallets to regulated service providers, effectively limiting their use due to the inherently anonymous and permissionless characteristics of cryptocurrency networks.

The regulation mandates enhanced monitoring of cryptocurrency asset transfers and requires crypto businesses to implement rigorous due diligence practices to deter money laundering. The scope of entities required to adhere to these regulations has expanded to include most of the cryptocurrency industry, necessitating thorough customer background checks.

The legislation also emphasizes the necessity for detailed records of actual beneficiaries, aiming to disclose the real owners or controllers of legal entities. This initiative will compel a broad spectrum of entities, including banks, real estate firms, and cryptocurrency businesses, to intensify their customer verification processes.

“If institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you,” Wood said at Friday’s Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York.

In January, Wood predicted Bitcoin might reach $1.5 million by 2030.

The cryptocurrency has increased by 45% since the beginning of the year and is currently trading at around $64,844.

Further, Wood noted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) hesitation in accepting institutional investments in Bitcoin might propel the price.

Recall how Ark Invest was among 11 companies — others included BlackRock and Fidelity — to receive SEC approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.

The introduction of these products has increased demand, shattering previous records for inflows into US ETFs and sparking new interest in Bitcoin, which these funds directly invest in and hold.

Several industry experts also echo Wood’s stance that the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April will cause a supply shock. As such, the dwindling supply would support the current demand-driven rally.

Wood believes that the impending halving will have a similar impact as past halving events in 2012, 2016, and 2020, which resulted in huge price hikes for Bitcoin.

She further reminded the audience that we are still in the early stages of developing an internet-based financial ecosystem that will eliminate many intermediate costs.

Wood’s comments reinforce her January prediction that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030. She sees these trends as critical to Bitcoin’s widespread adoption.

https://crypto.news/grayscale-ethereum-etf-decision-postponed-again-sec/,Grayscale Ethereum ETF decision gets postponed again by SEC,2024-03-23 18:03:07+00:00,"Ogwu Osaemezu Emmanuel, Anthony Patrick","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again delayed approving the Grayscale Ethereum (ETH) Futures Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF).

The postponement, disclosed in an SEC filing on March 22, extends the deadline from March 31 to May 30.

The decision has sparked significant interest and speculation within the cryptocurrency community, since it directly affects the status of Grayscale’s Ethereum Futures Trust ETF.

This delay comes against the backdrop of a broader regulatory landscape that is increasingly scrutinizing crypto-based financial products, following the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.

So far, Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF application has been subject to multiple delays, with the SEC seeking additional time to evaluate the proposed rule change and address raised concerns. The decision whether to approve or disapprove the ETF was initially scheduled for December 2023, but the SEC postponed the decision, citing the need for additional public input.

In January, the SEC extended its decision-making process on Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF, as well as BlackRock’s application for an ether ETF. This action contributed to the increasing uncertainties regarding the approval timeline and sparked inquiries into the regulatory prospects for crypto-based financial products.

Long-term effect on Grayscale, crypto industry

Analysts suggest that the approval of Ethereum-based ETFs could potentially lead to a surge in Ethereum prices, positioning it as a strong competitor to Bitcoin (BTC) in the market.

As stakeholders closely monitor these developments, the decision on Grayscale’s Ethereum Futures Trust ETF remains a focal point in the crypto investment landscape, shaping the future trajectory of Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market.

Earlier this month, the SEC met with spot Ethereum ETF applicants to discuss bids for Ether-based investment vehicles.

This meeting came amidst a surge of interest in spot Ethereum ETFs following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin products.

The SEC has delayed decisions on spot Ether-based products, with VanEck’s filing taking the lead in this regulatory process. Other major issuers eagerly awaiting responses include BlackRock, Franklin Templeton Grayscale, and Invesco Galaxy.

The SEC’s postponement of decisions on these Ether-based products until at least May has created a sense of uncertainty within the industry.

VanEck’s filing holds a pivotal position, with the SEC facing a deadline of May 23 to either accept or reject their bid, setting the tone for subsequent decisions on similar applications from prominent asset managers.

The path to approving spot Ethereum ETFs faced challenges as the SEC grappled with regulatory complexities and concerns unique to Ethereum compared to Bitcoin.

Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at Variant Fund, has expressed uncertainty regarding the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC by the May deadline. Chervinsky’s doubts stem from legal issues and the policy environment in Washington, D.C., which he believes make denial or a request for withdrawal by the SEC more likely than approval.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s cautious approach to cryptocurrencies introduced an additional level of uncertainty into the approval process, highlighting the high-risk nature of crypto assets and the necessity for consensus among commissioners.

Despite the growing interest and anticipation surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs, regulatory challenges and ongoing dialogues with issuers highlighted the complex dynamics influencing the future of Ether-based investment products in the market."

Bloomberg, quoting Montenegrin state TV, indicates that Goran Rodic, Kwon’s lawyer, corroborated the release, revealing that Kwon’s passport had been confiscated to prevent him from leaving the country.

Subsequently, Kwon was relocated to a shelter for foreigners. Rodic indicated plans to appeal to the court, arguing for Kwon’s ability to remain at large until a decision on extradition is reached.

Gensler also explained that the lack of registration means no mandatory information disclosure.

“Many would agree that the crypto markets could use a little disinfectant.” Gary Gensler, SEC Chair

Gensler has consistently warned that cryptocurrency exchanges must register with the agency and that cryptocurrency firms are subject to the same rules as traditional financial companies.

Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC is actively increasing pressure on the cryptocurrency industry. The primary U.S. exchange regulator has already filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, the two largest cryptocurrency exchanges.

Ahead of the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, Gensler also criticized cryptocurrencies, saying that investing in them can only be risky and unstable. After Bitcoin (BTC) had updated its all-time high, Gensler compared Bitcoin to a roller coaster and noted that evaluating the asset’s fundamentals was necessary."

The crypto market recently experienced a shift, moving away from the potential rally anticipated last week. Bitcoin’s inability to hold above $70,000 led to a pullback, defying previous expectations of a sustained rally.

This week, the market saw a surge in put demand alongside a sharp increase in implied volatility across all significant terms. However, contrary to expectations, many put positions closed at a profit, reflecting a strategic exit by investors.

Bitcoin’s price is now just below $63,000, marking a 6% decrease today. The price decline aligns with a record outflow of $742 million from Bitcoin ETFs over the week, underscoring investor caution and a shift in market sentiment.

These devices, hosted on the Solana blockchain, are part of the DePIN project, which aims to connect the unconnected by the end of the year. Only 30 million individuals in India, a country of more than 1.4 billion, have access to WiFi, while a large portion of the population remains detached from the internet.

The company’s strategy focuses on decentralization to combat the limited reach of India’s major telecom corporations, which primarily serve urban areas. Karam Lakshman, CEO of Wifi Dabba, criticized the slow pace of current connectivity efforts. He believes that achieving nationwide coverage could take decades. He stressed the importance of widespread internet access to support India’s position as the second-largest crypto holder and the fifth-largest global economy.

In a statement, Lakshman advocated for the role of blockchain technology in providing reliable internet access, with device maintenance managed by external providers. He views the DePIN model as a scalable solution for improving internet connectivity in developing nations.



The project plans on using India as a testing ground for global applications.

To extend its network, Wifi Dabba plans to collaborate with Local Cable Operators (LCOs) in India, leveraging their reach within communities. This partnership aims to foster growth and market leadership in decentralized wireless and WiFi networks, as noted by Arul Murugan, Managing Partner at Borderless Capital, one of the project’s main investors.

He laughed off the notion that his failure was something he deeply regretted, implying that bankruptcies are very common within the crypto industry.

Davies maintained that his professional reputation is unblemished, regardless of the serious criticism he has received for his conduct before and after to the downfall of 3AC. He revealed that he was meeting with the fund’s creditors and had also consulted with Teneo, the 3AC liquidator.

Davies remained optimistic about the situation, noting that they might soon reach a settlement fair for all parties.

On Dec. 21, Teneo obtained a court order in the British Virgin Islands to freeze $1.14 billion in Davies and Zhu’s assets. The liquidator is trying to recover the $3.3 billion that they owe creditors after 3AC went bankrupt.

The firm specifically targeted Zhu and Davies for $1.3 billion, accusing them of recklessly leveraging investor funds after the hedge fund became insolvent.

Davies defended 3AC’s investment tactics, blaming their high-risk business practices on his unshakable belief in a long-term bull market. He has accused the media of exaggerating the fund’s troubles and pointed fingers at lenders for irresponsibly investing their clients’ funds in high-risk schemes.

3AC fell during a crypto market slump as it was unable to meet creditor demands. The firm went from managing $10 billion in assets in 2021 to filing for bankruptcy in July 2022. By April 2022, the value of all 3AC assets had dropped to $3 billion, continuing to fall until the declaration of bankruptcy.

Post-collapse, Davies and 3AC’s other co-founder, Su Zhu, embarked on a new venture with the launch of Open Exchange (OPNX), a crypto derivatives and claims trading platform. However, the operation was short-lived, and all operations shut down in February 2024.

As per data by CoinMarketcap, on March 22, the token’s value reached $0.0096, marking its highest level since 2022.

RSR 24-hour price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap

The surge occurs at a time marked by a general downturn in the market, with major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple experiencing declines.

Reserve Rights is a blockchain initiative aimed at creating a stable, inflation-resistant currency. The Reserve Protocol allows users to produce RTokens, which are assets that are launched into the ecosystem.

Anyone can create an RToken by simply depositing collateral utilizing blockchain technology. Typically, these tokens can be redeemed 1:1 for the underlying assets. Most significantly, they are intended to be overcollateralized, which means that if any of the collateral tokens fail, there is a pool of value to protect the value of the RToken holders.

The reasons behind the sudden increase in Reserve Rights Token’s price remain speculative. According to sources, the sudden surge of this token appears to have been caused by tweets from several well-known people in the cryptocurrency business.

They speculated on Twitter about Reserve’s potential involvement in the emerging blockchain asset tokenization trend. RSR investor @MopHandle envisioned a scenario in which Reserve Protocol would launch on Coinbase’s newly launched Ethereum Layer-2 network Base in August 2023.

Another factor attributed to the rise is the enthusiasm surrounding Blackrock’s announcement of a tokenization fund on Ethereum.

The Blackrock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund’s ticker is BUIDL, and it is backed by cash and Treasuries. According to a statement from the company’s head of digital assets,

“We are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients, and we are excited to work with Securitize.” Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets

Blackrock’s venture into tokenization underscores a growing interest in tokenized assets, joining other prominent entities such as Franklin Templeton, JPMorgan, London Stock Exchange, and Citi, which have introduced similar products in recent months.

With over $10 trillion in assets under management, Blackrock’s entry into the tokenization space is seen as a significant endorsement of the demand for such assets and a validation of the Reserve Rights blockchain company.

Discussions on social media further suggest that the Reserve Protocol’s capacity to maintain stable assets, demonstrated during the USDC depeg event amidst the Silicon Valley Bank crisis, positions it as a vital player in the tokenization efforts of major firms.

Tweets by @cjdemelker highlighted the alignment of Blackrock’s involvement and rumors of a Coinbase collaboration with Reserve’s potential, signaling a promising outlook for RSR holders, especially if the token surpasses the $0.01 mark.

The scam unfolded shortly after the Token Generation Event (TGE), when Jolan, tasked with distributing airdrop tokens, sold 13% of the TICKER supply for $900,000 on March 16, betraying the community’s trust. ZackXBT’s investigation began with conversations with another team member, leading to the exposure of Jolan’s actions on Warpcast and X.

The Bitcoin halving, occurring every four years or upon mining every 210,000 blocks, will see miner rewards halve from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin per block upon reaching the 840,000 block.

The document aims to guide institutional investors by examining the impact of previous halvings and incorporating the recent developments in the cryptocurrency market, such as the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin’s ascent to unprecedented heights before the halving.

Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant valuation increases in the months following past halvings. The first halving led to a dramatic surge in Bitcoin’s (BTC) value, climbing 139% in the six months leading up to the event and 923% in the following six months. Although the extent of growth in previous halvings has not matched this initial surge, the pattern of post-halving appreciation has been observed.

Coinbase analysts highlight the unique conditions surrounding the upcoming halving, noting Bitcoin’s 157% increase since October and suggesting the potential for continued growth.

“While it’s possible that the halving could positively impact Bitcoin’s performance, there’s still only limited historical evidence about this relationship, making it somewhat speculative,” the company’s analysts explained.

The report also points to macroeconomic factors, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Additionally, it considers the behavior of long-term holders, defined by Glassnode as investors holding for at least 155 days, who historically are less likely to sell in response to halvings.

The primer does not overlook potential challenges, including the likelihood of increased selling pressure from miners adjusting to lower rewards and companies navigating bankruptcy proceedings."

One of the main ideas of the developer is to consolidate the existing division into “operators” and “delegators,” as well as the introduction of classes of “heavy” and “light” services with different levels of responsibility and income.

In his speech, Buterin drew attention to a category he called “lazy stakers”. Its representatives own 32 Ethereum (ETH), the minimum threshold for the validator to operate. Typically, such a group uses pools and liquid staking instruments. The Ethereum founder believes stakeholders could opt for individual staking to reduce centralization risks.

Buterin also noted that users were repeatedly told not to use Lido Finance, while its total value locked (TVL) is now $34.3 billion, being the largest Ethereum validator and controlling more than 30% of assets. Other major providers of liquid staking services include Binance and Coinbase, which are major crypto exchanges.

In October 2023, Buterin proposed staking changes aimed at reducing Ethereum’s centralization. He expressed concern about asset distribution among Ethereum liquid staking providers. At that time, the liquid pool of the Lido Finance platform controlled more than 70% of Ethereum in staking, although the asset is distributed among various validators."

‘Seaport hooks,’ a new feature of the upgrade, is modeled around Uniswap v4 hooks. The goal of this feature is to facilitate the development of applications that increase NFTs’ utility and liquidity. By functioning as order fulfillment plugins, these hooks enable developers to easily integrate custom contracts into the Seaport protocol.

OpenSea and the Seaport Working Group are thrilled to unveil Seaport 1.6 — the latest generation of the most advanced NFT marketplace protocol in the EVM ecosystem.

Using the Seaport hooks function, contracts can be deployed and invoked by Seaport, ensuring a smooth and efficient order execution process. This allows NFTs to adapt their properties based on purchase conditions such as price and volume and can be obtained using specific currencies or other NFTs. It also allows for the development of bonding curves and price oracles for NFTs.

OpenSea intends to move user orders to Seaport 1.6 on Monday, March 25. This technique does not involve user interaction. Furthermore, as of Monday, April 1, only Seaport 1.6 orders will be accepted by the OpenSea Developer API. Consequently, Seaport 1.5 will be phased out over time.

In addition, OpenSea mentioned that the integration of seaport hooks will allow NFT sales to access liquidity from various on-chain sources. This integration is expected to broaden the possibilities for DeFi and NFT interoperability, bringing in features such as time-weighted average price (TWAP) oracles for the NFT sector.

“Hooks and the broader Seaport ecosystem are an invitation to the developer and creator community to push the envelope for what’s possible for NFTs, and, ideally, to enable those experiences to be natively surfaced,” Opensea wrote in the official announcement.

The update comes as the NFT market is experiencing a slump in numbers. On March 6, data from Cryptoslam revealed that OpenSea, once the top NFT marketplace, now ranks fourth in the list.

The initiative aims to reduce transaction fees on its primary layer by 15% to 33%, as announced on March 20. The idea stems from Eric Connor, a key Ethereum developer, and Mariano Conti, former head of smart contracts at MakerDAO, via a newly established website for the initiative. Their objective is to accommodate a 33% greater transaction volume daily on Ethereum, potentially reducing layer-1 transaction fees significantly.

Today, @nanexcool and I are launching an effort to help raise the Ethereum gas limit from 30mn to 40mn



This can result in a 15-33% reduction in L1 tx fees



We are calling on solo stakers, client teams, pools and community members to help#pumpthegas https://t.co/TYoyI35cle — eric.eth (@econoar) March 19, 2024

Central to the campaign is the conern that while data blobs introduced in the Dencun update via EIP-4844 have successfully reduced layer-2 transaction prices, layer-1 fees have remained unchanged. The developers are of the opinion that by increasing the gas limit and utilizing data blobs, scaling for both layer-1 and layer-2 networks might be greatly improved.



Crypto.news reached out to Connors for further insights but didnot hear back.

Gas, measured in gwei (a fraction of Ether), is used to complete transactions or execute smart contracts. As such, the gas limit is a crucial parameter for the Ethereum network. It determines the maximum amount of gas that can be used for transactions or smart contracts in a block. Since August 2021, the limit has been set at 30 million.

Gas limit standardization guarantees that block sizes are kept at a manageable level, thus maintaining network speed and synchronization. When new blocks are formed, validators can dynamically modify these limits depending on certain criteria.

The idea behind raising the gas limit is that it allows for more transactions per block, which will make the network faster and more capable. However, this also means an increased demand for hardware resources, leading to greater risks of network spam and vulnerability to attacks.

In the past, the gas limit has been gradually adjusted to accommodate the growth of the network. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has previously proposed raising it to 40 million in January, consistent with growing support for this change within the community.

This proposal has seen support within the Ethereum community, evidenced by active discussions and endorsements on social media platforms, with a Rocket Pool validator already proposing a block reflecting the new 40 million gas limit on March 20.

Although some community members and developers are hopeful, doubts have been aired. Evan Van Ness, a venture investor and Ethereum advocate, expressed his cynicism about increasing the gas limit, especially since the EIP-4844 via the Dencun upgrade also had an impact on block size.

https://twitter.com/evan_van_ness/status/1770562278368203254

Concerns regarding the potential increase in the gas limit were also voiced earlier this year by Marius van der Wijden, an Ethereum engineer, who stated that it could impact the state of the blockchain, which includes data related to smart contracts and account balances. He pointed out that while size alone might not be the main problem, accessing and altering this data could become increasingly slower.

The Ethereum network has been facing persistent scalability issues since its inception. This also has been a key reason behind hefty gas fees that the network has seen in times of heavy load. On March 4, 2024, gas fees hit as high as 174 gwei. It is yet to be seen if this new initiative succeeds in delivering on its promise."

The selection of these specific cryptocurrencies for futures contracts by Coinbase might hold deeper significance due to their shared foundational code with Bitcoin, now broadly acknowledged as a commodity by regulatory bodies.

James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, reflected on the move, stating it could challenge the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to clarify the distinction between securities and commodities beyond current justifications.

This is interesting… wonder if the SEC objects to these being classified 'commodities futures' vs 'securities futures'.

Scott Johnsson, General Partner and General Counsel at Van Buren Capital, commented on the implications of Coinbase’s strategic move, envisioning it as the beginning of a broader trend and anticipating further applications in the wake of changes in US regulatory leadership.

Johnsson also highlighted that such futures listings might be a critical step toward the establishment of spot crypto ETFs.

The development comes in the backdrop of the SEC’s eventual approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs after a protracted legal confrontation with Grayscale.

The victims had invested in various Miner Extractable Value (MEV) bots, which Robb claimed would soon be operational. However, instead of delivering on his promises, the on-chain sleuth claims Robb vanished with investors’ funds.

Moreover, the excuses for the delays ranged from COVID-related setbacks to health issues, exchange glitches, and even alleged extortion. Meanwhile, the frustrated investors sought multiple avenues to recover their funds, with some working with ZachXBT to get justice.

Interestingly, the sleuth revealed last December that Robb had a checkered past. In 2002, he pleaded guilty to a $4 million scam, defrauding investors and using the ill-gotten gains to indulge in frivolities. Moreover, in 2007, he was sentenced to three years for fraud after stealing from over ten victims in Colorado.

Shortly after ZachXBT’s disclosure in December 2023, Robb threatened legal action against him, noting that he still plans to launch the MEV project. The recent arrest comes three months after the alleged $1.2 million rug case came to limelight.

Sweden’s central bank, Riksbank, cautioned in its recent research note on CBDCs about the potential risks associated with unsynchronized data in offline payments. Highlighting the importance of synchronizing offline transactions with online balances, the bank addressed concerns regarding liquidity risks stemming from shadow wallets, and intermediary nodes that facilitate connections between offline and online wallets.

The risk becomes apparent when multiple users engage in consecutive offline transactions without proper synchronization. For instance, when individuals add CBDCs to their offline wallets, it’s crucial for the system to align this balance with their online counterparts. However, if users spend CBDCs offline, discrepancies emerge between the offline and online balances, resulting in reduced funds for recipients.

If a recipient attempts to synchronize their wallet after receiving CBDCs from an offline transaction but finds that the sender hasn’t synced their wallet, they face usability issues, the central bank explains, adding that this gap in security underscores the importance of sender synchronization to make funds available for recipients.

To tackle these challenges, Sweden’s central bank is exploring potential solutions, such as establishing liquidity pools for payments or imposing restrictions on offline CBDC usage. For instance, CBDCs received offline may only become available for offline transactions once synchronization occurs. However, the feasibility of these solutions remains uncertain, pending further analysis by the Riksbank.

Earlier this week, the infamous Lazarus Group reportedly funneled $12 million through crypto tumbler Tornado Cash. The funds were allegedly linked to last November’s HTX and Heco Bridge hack, which saw the platforms lose over $90 million.

However, this wasn’t the group’s only heist in 2023. Throughout the year, the North Korea-backed hackers compromised over $400 million worth of assets across various crypto platforms, including CoinEX, Poloniex, Stake.com, and Atomic Wallet. In 2022, the group was responsible for the biggest defi hack in history, as it compromised the Ronin Network to steal approximately $620 million.

Lazarus’s hacks occurred during a prolonged bear market in the crypto industry, reeling from the effects of FTX and Terra Luna’s collapse. In 2024, with the bull market running in full swing, significant tokens reaching all-time highs, and novel meme coins driving billions of dollars inflow into the market, Lazarus’s concerns are more prominent than ever.

To understand how the industry should prepare for such risks, crypto.news reached out to web3 security provider Cyvers, which exclusively detected the Poloniex hack last year.

How does Lazarus carry out its million-dollar crypto heists?

According to Cyvers CEO Deddy Lavid, the Lazarus Group has shifted its cyberattack strategies significantly in 2023, targeting centralized entities with a refined and dynamic approach. Moving beyond traditional phishing and brute force methods, the group now employs AI-driven phishing campaigns and complex smart contract exploits.

Specifically, the attacks on Poloniex and HTX focused on stealing private keys and launching a series of small attacks in a short period. The group also used pre-programmed bots to run automated attacks. The bots tend to live in a system for a long time undetected before starting to exfiltrate the assets.

Lavid also mentioned that Lazarus Group’s operational methods resemble military precision, reflecting a rare level of professionalism among cybercriminal syndicates. Lavid outlines a recurring pattern in their attacks: initial infiltration through social engineering, remaining dormant within the target organization for months, and stealing private keys for a series of quick, well-orchestrated attacks involving dry runs and fast, anomalous transaction rates.

The preparatory phase is followed by dispersing the stolen assets across multiple blockchains, eventually funneling them through mixers or exchanges for laundering.

So, while the crypto bull run of 2024 offers an exhilarating prospect for investors and innovators alike, it also presents an urgent call to arms for the security sector.

“My analysis emphasizes the need for increased security measures in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, urging a deeper recognition of information security’s importance, a call for more security professionals, and a focus on proactive attack prevention.” – Deddy Lavid, CEO at Cyvers

In 2024, Lavid foresees a crypto market that outgrows its nascent vulnerabilities to adopt a more mature approach to security.

Crypto platforms need to allocate greater resources towards developing security expertise within companies and a holistic strategy that preempts attacks and comprehensively addresses potential fraud across the blockchain."

According to a Bloomberg report, the committee formed during the bankruptcy case demands the return of assets that Celsius’s major clients withdrew from the crypto platform shortly before it filed for bankruptcy. This will avoid possible litigation.

Advisors began contacting clients who had withdrawn more than $100,000 from the platform in the lead-up to the company’s bankruptcy. The assets recovered through this process will help repay creditors who have yet to withdraw funds from Celsius.

“The committee is giving customers the option to settle their potential liabilities based on what their assets were worth when they made withdraws in 2022, meaning settling customers would retain any appreciation of their digital assets experienced over the past year thanks to surging crypto prices.” Bloomberg report

The recovery process will only affect about 2% of Celsius users, who collectively withdrew roughly 40% of the platform’s assets 90 days before the company filed for Chapter 11. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, Celsius said it had $6 billion in crypto assets, 1.7 million registered users, and 300,000 active users with account balances over $100.

In mid-August 2022, Celsius Network’s debts exceeded its assets by $2.85 billion. The amount of funds missing from the platform to pay creditors was almost 2.5 times greater than stated when filing for bankruptcy, when the shortage of funds was estimated at $1.2 billion.

Celsius Network’s creditors developed a plan to reorganize the company, which most account holders approved. The plan calls for the distribution of more than $3 billion in cryptocurrency and fiat funds to creditors."

According to the expert, disseminating information is divided into two parts: information contamination and information immunity. The same principle applies to meme coin hype.

Armonio notes that meme coins have become a unique phenomenon in the attention economy of the web3 era, where focus is directly assigned a financial value. The combination of capital and attention creates meme tokens. In addition to the wealth effect, the key opinion leaders’ (KOL) matrix, distribution environment, and consistency of information content are critical.

In this case, the author pays special attention to the Book of Meme (BOME) token phenomenon, supported by influencers who are also artists. While the artists aren’t big names, they stand out because they have a close-knit follower base.

“In the world of memes, where attention is key, the phenomenon of attention feeding back into investment can be considered. For example, the Bome community helped boost the value of the SMOWL community.” Armonio, AC Capital expert

The author reduces the hype around meme coins to information pressure. The essence of popularizing information is to ensure that the level of infection exceeds the level of immunity. As long as the number of people “infected” per unit of time exceeds those who have recovered, the number of followers of fashionable information increases, and the information spreads more widely.

Despite the correction of the first cryptocurrency, several altcoins are showing steady growth, especially meme tokens. According to CoinGecko, the total capitalization of this sector has reached almost $50 billion. Dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), and BOME were the most trending meme coins."

A Montenegro court previously ordered Kwon’s removal to South Korea for criminal prosecution after revoking extradition to the United States. The former Terraform Labs CEO had successfully challenged rulings allowing his removal to America on at least two occasions.

However, the latest decision greenlighting Kwon’s handover to his native country is reportedly final.

Kwon was caught along with former Terraform Labs financial executive Han Chang-Joon before boarding a private flight to the United Arab Emirates. According to law enforcement, the pair had obtained fake Costa Rican passports and were jailed for over six months on forgery charges.

Head of Kraken Institutional Tim Ogilvie said in a statement that the success of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in America effectively reignited demand for qualified crypto custody. Eight BTC ETF issuers chose Coinbase to safeguard Bitcoin for the funds.

The latest offering operates under the state-chartered bank Kraken Financial. Wyoming regulators granted the crypto startup a special purpose depository institution permit in 2020, allowing the firm to hold digital assets and run deposit accounts for institutions on a full-reserve basis.

In a preliminary proxy statement, Grayscale proposed four significant changes to facilitate this transformation. Changes include utilizing the ETH backing shares for participation in staking via a Proof-of-Stake protocol, granting authorized participants the authority to create and redeem shares, moving to a daily fee assessment model from the current monthly scheme, and introducing a third-party custodian equipped to handle shares through an omnibus account.

Omnibus accounts combine funds for executing trades on behalf of multiple clients, effectively anonymizing the identities of individual investors.

Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein conveyed optimism regarding the proposed amendments, emphasizing the potential to streamline and enhance the experience for ETHE shareholders. The initiative is part of a broader industry trend, as indicated by a similar submission from Fidelity Investments, reflecting increased interest in Ethereum ETFs with staking functionalities.

“In consideration for any staking activity in which the Fund may engage, the Fund would receive certain network rewards of ether tokens, which may be treated as income to the Fund as compensation for services provided,” Fidelity’s filing stated.

Despite these developments, the outlook for the SEC’s approval of spot Ether ETFs remains uncertain. Analysts from Bloomberg have expressed skepticism, suggesting that the SEC might reject all pending applications.

The modification came in response to the NAPP’s evaluation of “sufficient profitability” among cryptocurrency retailers and exchanges in the sector. Consequently, the NAPP introduced a new fee structure that affected both entities.

Per the new fee structure, crypto exchanges are now subject to a fee of 740 BRV, equivalent to UZS 251.6 million ($20,015) monthly. This is a significant hike from the earlier fee of 400 BRV or UZS 136 million ($10,819).

Meanwhile, crypto stores are now subject to a significantly higher fee of 185 BRV, amounting to UZS 62.9 million ($5,003). Earlier, the fees for crypto retailers were just 20 BRV, roughly UZS 6.8 million ($540) per month.

According to NAPP, these modifications are intended to significantly increase state budget gains from the crypto-asset sector. The agency expects the revenue generated from this sector to double once the new structure is in place.

Hong Kong-headquartered crypto custodian Hex Trust is set to start discussions about raising additional funds later this year, as the crypto market is signaling the potential for a long-sustained rally.

In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Hex Trust co-founder and CEO Alessio Quaglini said the custodian plans to start consultations about structuring “a [new funding] round,” although it is yet to determine whether this would be pursued in the first or second half of this year, as investors remain cautious.

“There’s been a real shift from September and October [2023] till now. We see more trading volumes and we see more appetite for risky assets.” Alessio Quaglini

Established in 2017, Hex Trust foresees a path to profitability in the current year following cost-saving measures implemented in 2023, according to Quaglini. Nevertheless, the custodian faces hurdles in achieving profitability, particularly in light of Hong Kong’s proposed regulatory framework.

Under these regulations, licensed centralized crypto exchanges in Hong Kong must develop and operate their own custody solutions, potentially sidelining third-party custodian services like those offered by Hex Trust.

The unnamed individual is accused of defrauding investors of $16.1 million, an arrest that follows after a crypto market maker’s failed attempt to flee by sea in December last year.

On Dec. 20, 2023, the individual, known under the alias Jon Bur Kim and real name Park, aged 42, was intercepted by Coast Guard officials while attempting to escape to China via a fishing boat from Jindo. His escape was hindered by a storm, leading to the boat’s docking at Mokpo.

Park, who had garnered a significant social media following by showcasing his luxury sports car collection, is currently detained and undergoing trial at the Haenam Branch of the Gwangju District Court. He is charged with illegally manipulating coin transaction prices, including providing bribes to crypto exchange employees to artificially inflate prices.

Prosecutors allege that from February 2021 to April 2022, Park collaborated with the arrested token issuer to launch and promote fraudulent cryptocurrencies, commonly referred to as “scam coins.” They are accused of using deceitful practices such as false data disclosure and market manipulation to convince investors of the legitimacy of their coins.

The prosecution further suggests that the duo might have engaged a “coin listing broker” to facilitate the listing of these coins, which subsequently led to rapid price surges, enabling them to sell their holdings for substantial profits.

The case against Park includes investigating his potential involvement in the crimes attributed to the unnamed token issuer as authorities continue to unravel the extent of their collaboration. The incident is part of a broader trend of scrutiny against altcoin issuers in South Korea amid growing concerns over the proliferation of scam coins and the involvement of celebrities in low-cap altcoin controversies.

Meanwhile, on March 8, U.S. prosecutors revealed preparations to appeal a Montenegrin high court ruling on the extradition of Terraform Labs’ former CEO, Do Kwon, to South Korea. The development is part of a complex legal battle involving multiple nations, including South Korea and the United States, both of which are seeking Kwon’s extradition on charges relating to the Terra ecosystem’s $40 billion collapse.

The charges against Kwon in the U.S. include fraud and market manipulation, with South Korea also pressing charges of fraud and capital markets law violations. Kwon’s legal team has shown a preference for his extradition to South Korea, emphasizing the proximity to his family and the potential for a 40-year prison sentence."

According to data provided by Farside Investors, a U.K.-based investment management firm, the spot Bitcoin ETF products experienced net outflows totaling $326.2 million on March 19, marking the second consecutive day of daily outflows.

This figure comes a week after the ETFs hit record inflows exceeding $1 billion on March 12.

Recall that these investment products ended a 10-day run of persistent inflows on March 18, when they recorded capital outflows totaling $154.3 million. The current two-day losing streak reflects a prevailing bearish sentiment amid Bitcoin’s price downturn.

Moreover, Bitcoin has persistently retraced the gains achieved during the recent market surge to $73,000. Following its all-time high of $73,750 on March 14, the cryptocurrency has experienced continual declines, marking a decrease of over 11% in the last week. This downward trend has exacerbated the decline in bullish pressure.

The latest ETF outflow of $326 million marks the largest daily net flow out of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, far surpassing the previous record of $158.4 million on Jan. 24. Data shows that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) championed most of these outflows, recording $443 million in capital exit.

Interestingly, the bearish outcome on March 19 did not stem from heightened outflows from these investment products, but rather from diminished inflows. Data shows that all products, excluding those from BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Bitwise, recorded a net flow of $0.

This indicates that while the ETFs failed to procure more BTC, investors did not notably withdraw their funds. BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity Investments’ FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB saw a combined inflow of $117.3 million, but this figure was not sufficient to offset the $443 million outflow solely recorded by Grayscale’s ETF.

Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, predicted this bearish turn of events in a recent statement. Thielen argued that the spot Bitcoin ETF market could see a drop in capital inflows as Bitcoin corrects the gains of the latest market uptrend."

The breach was first brought to light by renowned on-chain detective ZachXBT, who issued an alert regarding suspicious activities on Trezor’s social media account X. According to reports, fraudulent messages promoting a fake presale of a token dubbed “$TRZR” on the Solana Network were disseminated to Trezor’s followers.

Community alert: Trezor X/Twitter account is currently compromised pic.twitter.com/hNm2OUjEgE — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) March 19, 2024

The messages directed users to send funds to a specific Solana wallet address, inadvertently leading them to sites equipped with wallet drainers. The hackers also referenced Slerf, another memecoin on the Solana network, thereby attempting to boost engagement and funnel unsuspecting users towards the malicious contracts.

Trezor acted swiftly to remove the posts and address the situation, but not before the hacker managed to extract an estimated $8,100 from Trezor’s Zapper account.

Scam Sniffer, a platform dedicated to identifying crypto scams, corroborated ZachXBT’s findings shortly after the warning was issued, confirming the breach.

Despite the relatively small amount stolen, the incident has been harshly criticized, especially considering Trezor’s reputation as a security company. Jon Holmquist, a crypto security researcher, described the breach as a “major L for Trezor.”

Founded in 2012 by SatoshiLabs, Trezor has been at the forefront of providing secure hardware wallet solutions for the storage and management of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. With over two million devices sold globally, the brand is renowned for its Secure Element chip technology. However, recent events have highlighted vulnerabilities, including XSS (cross-site scripting) in older versions of Trezor Connect, CSRF (cross-site request forgery) issues in its Dropbox integration and missing path isolation checks.

This is not Trezor’s first encounter with security threats. Earlier this year, on Jan. 25, Trezor issued a warning about malicious emails being sent to its users from an impersonated Trezor team email. The phishing attempt asked users to upgrade their “network” or risk losing their funds, directing them to a malicious site where they were prompted to enter their seed phrase.

Further investigation revealed that an unauthorized individual had accessed the newsletter subscriber email database, using a third-party service to dispatch the harmful emails.

The breach follows on the heels of Trezor’s announcement of two new products at the Bitcoin Amsterdam conference on Oct. 12 last year – The Trezor Safe 3, the latest in their flagship series of hardware wallets, and Trezor Metal, a premium metal backup device, marking a major expansion of their product lineup despite the challenges faced."

For Binance, MobileCoin holds significance beyond being just another tradable token. In 2018, Binance Labs, the exchange’s venture arm, led a funding round for MobileCoin, wherein the project secured $29.7 million in exchange for 37.5 million tokens.

At the time, Binance Labs said that MobileCoin “plays a critical role in driving mainstream cryptocurrency adoption,” adding that the MobileCoin team and Binance Labs “share a common vision.” It remains unclear whether Binance or its affiliated entities, still possess MOB tokens.

U.S. prosecutors’ proposal to put FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in prison for as long as 50 years adopts a “medieval view of punishment,” as the filing portrays the disgraced crypto entrepreneur as a “depraved super-villain,” Bloomberg reports, citing a written response from Bankman-Fried’s lawyers on the proposal.

Nonetheless, prosecutors assert that a sentence ranging from 40 to 50 years is warranted for Bankman-Fried’s involvement in what they describe as a “historic” crime, which targeted over 1 million victims and resulted in losses exceeding $10 billion due to the collapse of FTX. Bankman-Fried’s defense team disagrees, proposing a prison term of 5.25 to 6.5 years, and emphasizing that despite FTX’s collapse, the exchange’s clients were reimbursed.

“With marked hostility, the memorandum distorts reality to support its precious ‘loss’ narrative and casts Sam as a depraved super-villain; it attributes to him dark and megalomaniacal motives that fly in the face of the record; it makes apocalyptic prophecies of recidivism; and it adopts a medieval view of punishment to reach what amounts to a death-in-prison sentencing recommendation.” Bankman-Fried’s defense team

In November 2023, a jury unanimously convicted the FTX founder on all seven criminal charges. FTX and Alameda Research declared bankruptcy in November 2022 as the crisis unfolded.

Soroban, which has transitioned to its mainnet phase two following two years of testing, facilitates the development of decentralized applications.

Soroban introduces a novel approach for developers to deploy smart contracts, expanding the types of applications that can be constructed on the Stellar blockchain. The platform employs WebAssembly, a binary code format for traditional web and blockchain integrations.

Smart contracts are live!



Today, we're thrilled to announce a major milestone on the #Stellar Mainnet journey: the training wheels are off, and all restriction limits have been lifted!

Stellar’s platform development aims to diversify the uses of its network, extending its functionalities beyond cryptocurrency payments to include decentralized finance (defi) and other financial services.

To encourage the development of Soroban, the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) has allocated $100 million to a Soroban Adoption Fund, which has supported over 160 projects. The projects cover a range of applications, from bridge projects like Axelar and Allbridge to the Band Protocol oracle and defi initiatives such as Sworoswap and Blend, all aiming to leverage Stellar’s smart contract capabilities.

Stellar was co-founded in 2014 by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim as an open-source blockchain network focusing on cross-border transactions. Due to its origins as a fork, Stellar initially resembled Ripple, but it later underwent significant changes, adopting a unique consensus mechanism known as the Stellar Consensus Protocol."

Ethereum took the most brutal hit, accounting for $4.2 million of the total liquidations. According to data from Parsec, a further threat of destabilization if ETH drops to $3,008 could trigger an additional $24 million in liquidations.

On-chain derivatives exchanges such as GMX, Kwenta, and Polynomial have been at the center of these liquidations, which cumulatively triggered over $52 million in the past day alone. When collaterals are liquidated in the context of defi, it means that assets pledged as security for loans are being sold off by the platform or protocol.

In defi lending, loans are often over-collateralized to account for the volatility of cryptocurrency prices. However, when the market price of the collateral asset, like Ethereum (ETH) in this case, drops sharply, it can trigger a liquidation event. The platform automatically sells the collateral to ensure the loan is repaid, often at a lower market value, leading to potential losses for the borrower.

Ethereum is trading at approximately $3,338, marking a 15% decline over the past week. The overall crypto market cap is down by 3.5% today and is faced with notable liquidation after a month-long rally."

Hougan’s sentiment diverges from the initial optimism surrounding the May deadline for the SEC decision on the first pending spot Ether ETF applications.

While expectations were high initially, recent assessments suggest a tempered outlook for a May launch due to perceived stagnation in progress. Hougan proposed a delay, suggesting that launching spot Ether ETFs in December may be better and more beneficial.

The Bitwise CIO reasoned that allowing Wall Street and traditional finance more time to understand how complex cryptocurrency can be, particularly Bitcoin, would likely result in a more receptive market for Ethereum (ETH) and its ETF.

“Wall Street and traditional finance just started ingesting this giant thing called Bitcoin, and they’re just getting their hands around it,” he noted. “And I think you need to give them longer to digest.”

In addition, the judge stated that at the time the withdrawal of funds from Gemini Earn was stopped, 340,000 users were participating in the program. At the time, Genesis kept $900 million of client funds on the platform.

According to a Bloomberg report on March 19, the strategy is designed to prevent U.S. investors from accessing its trading platform. The screening enhancements are tailored for prime brokers that primarily serve institutional investors.

These brokers are now required to gather comprehensive client data, including information about the geographical locations of the clients’ offices, as well as specific facts about the founders and staff. Furthermore, clients must confirm the accuracy of this information, guaranteeing the reliability and integrity of the data.

“Binance is fully committed to compliance and has made public how it assesses end users who can access the Binance platform. By making its standard transparent, Binance gives clarity to enterprises who want to access its market-leading liquidity,” a Binance representative told Crypto.news.

Moreover, the representative highlighted the “Binance Link Program,” an initiative aimed at enhancing trading and connectivity services for businesses, including brokers, exchanges, and automated trading platforms. Although the Binance Link Program’s main objective is to increase trading and connectivity options, its underlying architecture could assist brokerages in complying with the exchange’s more stringent screening procedures.

The context of these actions is the admission of Bank Secrecy Act violations by Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao. Consequently, Binance was hit with a hefty $4.3 billion fine by the U.S. Department of Justice due to their alleged participation in money laundering, fraud, and sanctions breaches. Zhao was blasted by the Department of Justice for deliberately focusing on American clients while dodging U.S. regulations.

In addition, Binance has recently updated its token listing guidelines, implementing a more extended “cliff period” for new tokens and requiring security deposits and token reserves for market makers. By extending the initial six-month threshold to a minimum of a year, these steps seek to stabilize the market for newly launched tokens.

Against this backdrop, Binance Labs, Binance’s venture capital arm, has established itself as a separate company from the Binance group. This separation was first announced discreetly on the Binance Labs website, later reported by Bloomberg on March 15. According to Investment Director Alex Odagiu, Binance Labs will continue operations under the Binance brand based on a licensing agreement."

Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein has announced plans to reduce fees on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) in the coming months as the crypto market craze seems to cool off. In an interview with CNBC, Sonnenshein revealed plans to gradually decrease fees on GBTC, justifying the current 1.5% management fee by citing GBTC’s liquidity and track record compared to other exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the market.

“I’ll happily confirm that, over time, as this market matures, the fees on GBTC will come down.” Michael Sonnenshein

For comparison, Vanguard has waived fees for investors until March 2025, while BlackRock charges a mere 0.12%. Sonnenshein also mentioned Grayscale’s plans to introduce a lower-fee version of its flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, trading under the ticker “BTC.” However, no specific launch timeframe was provided.

Galaxy Digital Holdings’ institutional investing division credited the milestone to a growing enthusiasm among institutional investors for digital assets. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, announced this accomplishment on March 19 on X, characterizing it as an ongoing effort to broaden investor access to the digital economy.

We are proud of our continuous progress in enabling investor access to the growing digital economy. Congrats @SteveKurz and… https://t.co/k659kfI9pu — Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) March 18, 2024

Galaxy Asset Management has witnessed a significant increase in its AUM over the past year, more than tripling its value. The firm asserts that this was the result of a number of investment strategies, such as “passive, active, and venture investment strategies,” one of which was the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO).

Interestingly, BTCO has experienced relatively modest inflows of $175 million to date, trailing behind only the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) and the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), both of which were introduced in mid-January and have recorded even lower inflows.

On March 18, the company also reported a preliminary AUM of $10.1 billion, up 24.8% from February. The investment firm pointed out that while net outflows from a specific “opportunistic mandate” acted as a brake on further growth, the general market growth was the main driver behind this hike.

Despite the recent milestone, Galaxy Digital’s stock (GLXY) saw a 4% decline to close at $12.80 in after-hours trading. However, over a longer timeframe, the stock price is up by 23.5% since the start of the year, buoyed by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in mid-January. Yet, it remains significantly below its all-time high of $40 from November 2021.

Along with its successes in asset management, Galaxy Digital is currently waiting for regulatory clearance to launch a spot Ethereum ETF; a decision is anticipated by July 5. The firm was founded in 2018 and includes Galaxy Digital Holdings’ Global Markets and Digital Infrastructure Solutions divisions. It is led by Steve Kurz, who serves as the Global Head of GAM.

The milestone for Galaxy Digital coincided with Bitcoin ETFs recording massive inflows. In a Forbes interview, Novogratz predicted that this development will contribute to launching Bitcoin’s subsequent wave of adoption.

On the contrary, Novogratz forecasts that Bitcoin’s price could go through a correction and fall as low as $50,000. The projection appears to be accurate as the value of Bitcoin has dipped from its peak of $73,580 on March 14 to $63,877 at the present evaluation.

In a more recent interview with CNBC, he detailed that ongoing net inflows into the nine U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs will likely propel BTC’s price higher. On the flip side, a transition to net outflows from these ETFs could mark the onset of the first significant market correction.

This trend, Novogratz pointed out, is now a critical watchpoint for traders tracking the inflows and outflows of spot Bitcoin ETFs."

“ICOs attracted new investors in 2018, but they at least pretended to build products. Now, crypto developers just start meme coins rather than building something. It’s a lot worse than shitcoin ICOs.” Ki Young Ju

The document states, “The Sponsor may, from time to time, stake a portion of the Fund’s assets through one or more trusted staking providers, which may include an affiliate of the Sponsor.”

Fidelity did not name any specific stake providers. Several Ether staking solutions are available now, including Lido DAO, RocketPool, and StakeWise. Following the announcement, Lido, the Ethereum network’s staking protocol, surged 9% to $2.64 before dipping back to $2.32.

Fidelity’s move to file for an Ethereum ETF back in November placed it among other potential issuers like BlackRock, Ark Invest, and Grayscale, intensifying the race to launch the first Ethereum ETF.

Interestingly, this decision comes on the back of the recent Bitcoin market uptrend and the success of the spot Bitcoin ETF market in the United States. The emergence of traditional institutional investors in the Bitcoin market has sparked increased global interest.

Ordinarily, the GPIF facilitates investments in various assets, including domestic and international stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments, to achieve optimal risk-adjusted returns while adhering to its investment guidelines and risk management principles.

Per the latest data, the GPIF recorded an impressive 20% increase in total assets under management (AUM) last year, bringing the figure to 224 trillion Yen as of December 2023 (approximately $1.489 trillion). This figure makes it the largest pension fund globally.

The interest in Bitcoin has been triggered by a flush of global demand for the asset class since last year. A Chainalysis report shows that Japan received the second-highest value in crypto transactions across Eastern Asia in 2023, topping $100 billion.

Amid the growing interest in crypto assets, GPIF is currently seeking useful information on the nature of Bitcoin and the other assets under consideration as well as the mechanics involved with their incorporation in pension funds abroad.

Significantly, the Houston Firefighters’ Relief and Retirement Fund revealed in October 2021 that it had invested $25 million in Bitcoin in collaboration with NYDIG. A month before that, pension funds in Virginia disclosed plans to invest $50 million in various cryptocurrencies.

The SEC claimed that Debt Box had transferred $720,000 overseas and was planning to flee to the United Arab Emirates, potentially moving more assets out of the country. These claims were later found to be misrepresented, with Judge Shelby discovering that the alleged overseas transfer had actually occurred within the United States.

“The bad faith in inextricable from the abusive conduct and a sanction of attorneys’ fees and costs for all expenses resulting from that conduct is appropriate,” said Shelby.

This legal setback for the SEC occurred after the agency initially filed a motion to dismiss the case without prejudice, a request that Judge Shelby denied. The case took a turn when the judge issued a “show cause order” in December, compelling the SEC to justify its actions. In response, the SEC admitted to inaccuracies in its representation of facts during a July hearing and acknowledged its failure to correct misinformation promptly.

SEC enforcement chief Gurbir Grewal issued an apology to Judge Shelby for the inaccuracies, assuring the court of steps to prevent similar errors in the future, including mandatory training sessions for staff starting January 2024. These measures aim to uphold proper standards in seeking emergency relief.

The implications of the Debt Box case extend beyond its immediate legal ramifications, highlighting broader industry concerns over the SEC’s aggressive regulatory stance on cryptocurrency under Chairman Gary Gensler.

Although the regulation does not specifically ban Tether (USDT), it imposes strict requirements on stablecoins issuers, particularly those considered significant due to size, user base, or market impact, a reason why market leaders like OKX are removing USDT trading pairs from the platform.

This strategic withdrawal precedes the EU’s expected enforcement of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which is set to be fully operational by Dec. 30 of this year.

The project’s website said its top contributor injected $200,000 or around 1,000 SOL into the meme coin pre-launch. The investor could not realize profits due to an error by the Slerf developer, who claims to have burned all SOL tokens raised by liquidity providers.

Slerf surged from $1.5 million to nearly $1 billion in market cap, generating hype and garnering multiple centralized exchange listings before it crashed below a $300 million valuation. Traders swapped over $2 billion of the meme coin within its first 12 hours.

The trend of raising millions in SOL in hours of a pre-sale announcement is fast becoming common in Solana’s ecosystem. As crypto.news reported, NFT project Milady attracted $18 million in two hours after sharing its latest offering dubbed Milady wif hat.

The idea is inspired by the viral meme play Dogwifhat (WIF), which earlier this month grossed a market cap of $3.2 billion.

Despite the prospect of a deeper correction, the report remains optimistic about the broader crypto market’s trajectory.

“We can still argue that Bitcoin will climb materially higher during the next few months as this bull market will likely continue,” Thielen commented, highlighting the value of Bitcoin reclaiming the $70,000 threshold, which could pave the way for further gains."

The latest reports show Pakistan’s crypto industry is worth nearly $20 million. As of 2023, the country was ranked among the top five highest crypto investors worldwide, with 15 million of its population actively owning cryptocurrencies.

In negotiations over a $3 billion standby agreement with the IMF, the lender has advised Pakistan’s Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to broaden Capital Gains Tax (CGT) coverage by including cryptocurrency transactions. The IMF also suggests reevaluating real estate and publicly traded securities tax brackets to ensure taxation on all profits, independent of ownership duration.

Under the proposed guidelines, real estate developers in Pakistan would have to record and declare every transfer of real estate interest before the finalization and official registration of property titles. Non-compliance with these regulations could lead to fines, including secondary liability for outstanding taxes. This initiative targets to regulate the common practice of trading plot files in housing projects.

After Pakistan accepts the terms, the IMF plans to release approximately $1.1 billion, the remaining portion of the bailout agreement from the previous summer. This agreement prevented Pakistan from defaulting on its sovereign debt."

CoinDCX, a popular Indian cryptocurrency platform, saw its trading volumes multiply fivefold within the past month, escalating from $5 million at the start of February to approximately $25 million by the end of the month. Sumit Gupta, the co-founder of CoinDCX, attributed this remarkable growth to the upward trajectory of Bitcoin prices in a recent interview with a local media outlet, The National.

In a similar vein, WazirX, Mumbai’s foremost cryptocurrency exchange and the largest in India, saw a 20-fold increase in trading volumes since the start of 2024. Rajagopal Menon, WazirX’s vice president, observed a notable rise in new user registrations and daily website traffic, linking this surge directly to the escalating Bitcoin prices and the resultant positive market sentiment.

Despite this surge in interest, trading volumes have not returned to their peak levels, partly due to heavy taxes on crypto transactions in India. In 2022, the government imposed a 30% tax on cryptocurrency profits and a 1% tax on all transactions. These measures have impacted retail investments, which, according to Menon, have not reached the heights seen in 2021. Concerns from Indian authorities about the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading, including potential misuse for money laundering, also contribute to the cautious approach to regulation.

However, some industry insiders still view the tax regime as the Indian government’s implicit acknowledgment of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment vehicles.

“Over the last couple of years, the industry has seen some progress, firstly the Government’s move to include the VDA industry under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) […] However, regulatory challenges, such as tax provisions introduced in the Finance Act of 2022, have remained a deterrent for further adoption,” Gupta told Crypto.news in a separate statement.

The need for regulatory clarity and confidence in the Indian cryptocurrency market remains crucial for sustaining demand. Sidharth Sogani, founder and chief executive of cryptocurrency research firm Crebaco, also highlighted the difference between the legal and regulated status of cryptocurrencies in India, pointing out that regulation would change the market dynamics significantly.

The concerns over cryptocurrency regulation have been highlighted by Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who firmly stated that Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets should not be regarded as currencies. Sitharaman is looking forward to the G20 — comprising 19 sovereign countries, the European Union (EU), and the African Union (AU) — to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.

“We have always maintained that Crypto is an asset class, and we have been advocating for regulatory clarity from this perspective,” Gupta added.

“Additionally, we should understand the value that this technology is bringing. This was also made evident by recent statements made by SEBI Chairperson and Shri Uday Kotak when he drew attention to the “emergence of an alternate market and how it is being legitimized by the U.S., UK, and Europe as a major part of their future.”

Gupta further stressed the importance of global collaboration among policymakers to develop a coherent and effective regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. He argued that such collaboration would lead to a pooling of resources, meaningful exchanges of knowledge, and faster progress toward establishing a regulatory framework that minimizes “regulatory arbitrage.”"

Arbitrum’s Atlas upgrade is now live

Offchain Labs, the primary developer behind Arbitrum, has announced the successful activation of the ArbOS 20 upgrade, dubbed “Atlas,” on the Arbitrum network.

As part of the ArbOS 20 update, the Atlas upgrade integrates Ethereum’s Dencun support and introduces blob transactions to streamline data processing at a reduced cost. With the Atlas upgrade now live, Arbitrum plans to implement additional reductions in execution transaction fees on March 18th.

At first, the Atlas upgrade focuses on reducing layer-1 (L1) posting fees through EIP-4844, with further reductions scheduled for next week. Arbitrum states that Atlas aims to decrease the L1 surplus fee per compressed byte from 32 gwei to zero and lower the layer-2 (L2) base fee from 0.1 gwei to 0.01 gwei. Consequently, applications on Arbitrum One should reap the benefits of the new pricing structure without requiring any modifications.

The blobs have landed on Arbitrum! 💙



🐡 ArbOS 20 ""Atlas"" is now live, blobs are in effect, reducing data posting costs.

According to Off Chain Labs, Layer 3 Rollup chains constructed atop Arbitrum One will automatically experience reduced fees.

Meanwhile, self-governed Orbit L2 rollup chains are encouraged to embrace ArbOS Atlas and enable blob posting to enjoy similar benefits.

Offchain Labs further highlights that Arbitrum RaaS (Rollups-as-a-Service) providers like Altlayer, Caldera, Conduit, and Gelato have committed to upgrading existing Orbit chains to support the Atlas upgrade and the Ethereum Dencun upgrade.

Moreover, the Atlas upgrade brings Arbitrum (ARB) in line with EVM’s security standards by incorporating support for EIP-6780. This paves the way for future improvements to the EVM.

Offchain Labs highlighted that by optimizing transaction costs, the Atlas upgrade will make previously impractical use cases like gaming, SocialFi, and DeFi exchanges viable.

The recent implementation of Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade, aimed at reducing gas fees on L2 blockchains, is expected to promote greater adoption of the Ethereum ecosystem. However, it’s important to note that immediate fee reductions are contingent upon project teams upgrading their architecture to accommodate the new standard.

In the evolution of Arbitrum, a series of upgrades have played a pivotal role in shaping its capabilities and performance. Before the recent Atlas upgrade, key enhancements made on the network marked significant milestones for the blockchain project.

The Arbitrum Nitro upgrade, released in August 2022, was a crucial development that focused on boosting network capacity and speed to address scalability challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem. This upgrade aimed to improve transaction throughput and efficiency, laying a solid foundation for a more robust and scalable Layer 2 solution.

In related news, the Arbitrum DAO has opted to retract a proposal aimed at donating around $1.28 million worth of ARB tokens to aid in covering legal expenses for Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev. This choice comes following concerns voiced by token holders regarding the potential legal liabilities linked with these donations.

This proposal, involving a donation of approximately $1.28 million worth of ARB tokens, aimed to support legal charges against Tornado Cash developers.

However, concerns raised by token holders regarding potential legal risks associated with this donation led to the withdrawal of the proposal.

After garnering more than 5,000 votes in the poll, the little-known NFT artist then launched a coin presale by posting a wallet address, which accumulated over 55,000 SOL, or $10.4 million at current prices, in a matter of hours.

Kero admitted to being clueless about what to make before the poll and named the new coin SNAP, after one of their meme characters Coco, a croc drawn in the style of another popular meme character, Pepe the Frog.

Kero is the creator of several NFT collections including Rare Coco and Snappy Cocos. Despite a history with NFTs, the artist does not have much of a track record when it comes to issuing tokens, leaving the worth of investments in the new venture rather ambiguous.

Some contributors claimed to have received tokens worth $17,000, but the meme coin is still in the early stages of development, with limited market liquidity, and its value is yet to stabilize.

SNAP is currently trading at $0.00004256, a 52.5% drop from the level it entered the crypto market at, according to data from CoinGecko.

In that period, it became the 30th most traded cryptocurrency, registering a trading volume of more than $679 million. It also has a market capitalization of $70.24 million, putting it on CoinMarketCap’s digital asset list at #2,374.

However, Bitfinex also posits that the halving could yield positive outcomes for Bitcoin’s price, citing the reduced pace of new coin generation which exacerbates supply scarcity.

“If the price of Bitcoin rises sufficiently, it could offset the reduced block reward, maintaining or even increasing mining profitability. This price appreciation is critical for encouraging continued investment and participation in mining activities.” Bitfinex

Nonetheless, uncertainty looms over whether the fourth halving will follow patterns seen in previous instances. Crypto exchange Coinbase, for instance, asserted in a recent research report that this time everything may be different, attributing the shift in market dynamics to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which have established a new demand anchor for BTC.

“We believe the current price move is only the beginning of a longer bull run and that it will take further price appreciation in order to drive supply vs demand dynamics into balance.” Coinbase

At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $68,000, according to CoinMarketCap data. Despite a slight retreat from its all-time high, industry executives remain united in their anticipation of Bitcoin’s continued rally, with expectations soaring far above $80,000 for the remainder of the year."

As London prepares to embrace a new era of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), financial giants like CoinShares, WisdomTree, and ETC Group, are eagerly eyeing opportunities to list their offerings on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), the Financial Times has learned.

The relaxation of regulations by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) signals a noticeable shift, yet criticism arises as the FCA still bars retail investors from accessing crypto ETPs on the LSE. While Bradley Duke, chief strategist of ETC Group, Europe’s largest crypto fund, emphasized readiness to introduce products on the exchange, he also expressed hope for a lifting of the retail ban in the near future.

“The LSE is such an important market for us we definitely will list products when possible and preparation is under way. We hope the retail ban will be lifted soon after.” Bradley Duke

Other major European crypto players such as VanEck, CoinShares, and WisdomTree also expressed interest in engaging with the London Stock Exchange regarding new listing opportunities.

However, the FCA’s limit to “professional investors only” has failed to attract every issuer active in the European crypto ETP market, which boasts a combined sum of $14.2 billion, the report notes. For example, even though Mandy Chiu, head of financial product development at 21Shares, positively commented on the approval of crypto ETPs on the LSE, calling the move “encouraging,” she noted that the firm would continue to “monitor” the situation and did not have plans for any U.K.-listed products as of press time.

As crypto.news reported earlier, the London Stock Exchange plans to start accepting applications for the admission of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in Q2, 2024. However, the exchange emphasized that these offerings will only be accessible to institutional entities such as investment firms, credit institutions, pension funds, and insurance companies.

This decision contrasts with the trend observed in other countries, where individual investors have been granted access to such investment vehicles. Nonetheless, the FCA’s decision marks the end of its blanket ban on crypto ETPs, aligning it more closely with the regulatory frameworks of Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the U.S."

The individuals, David Brend and Gustavo Rodriguez, now potentially face up to 20 years in prison for their involvement in what was revealed to be a “Ponzi” scheme.

In a verdict delivered on March 14, David Carmona, the founder of IcomTech, was found to have recruited Rodriguez in mid-2018 for the creation of a website for IcomTech. The company promised its investors guaranteed daily returns from its crypto trading and mining activities. However, the prosecution argued that these activities never took place, and the company instead operated a Ponzi scheme, redirecting funds from new investors to pay earlier ones.

Rodriguez was implicated in setting up fraudulent investment packages and manipulating daily returns accessible to investors via an online portal he managed.

Brend, alongside other promoters, was accused of diverting substantial amounts of investor funds for personal use, including purchasing real estate, funding lavish travels, and organizing extravagant events to attract more investment. These events were characterized by the display of luxury vehicles and clothing to project an image of wealth and financial success.

The scheme eventually collapsed in 2019 when the company failed to fulfill withdrawal requests, instead offering investors a token named “Icoms” as a supposed solution. These tokens, however, were deemed “essentially worthless,” exacerbating the investors’ losses.

Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, emphasized the scale of the deception, stating that the scheme “defrauded tens of thousands of people out of tens of millions of dollars,” highlighting the depth of financial damage inflicted on investors seeking to enhance their savings.

Sentencing for Brend is scheduled for June 27, followed by Rodriguez’s on June 28.

The conviction of Brend and Rodriguez is reminiscent of another crypto-related legal case involving Roman Sterlingov, the co-founder of Bitcoin Fog.

On March 12, Sterlingov was convicted of laundering money through a service designed to obscure the origins of illicitly obtained Bitcoin. His operation moved nearly $400 million in illegal transactions. This case, like that of Brend and Rodriguez, underscores the potential for fraud within the cryptocurrency sector.

Earlier last year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Utah-based firm Green United, accusing the company of violating federal securities laws by selling $18 million worth of fake cryptocurrency mining equipment."

Despite recent delays in transaction processing for both Solana and Ethereum on Coinbase, the platform has assured users that their funds remained secure throughout the ordeal.

Coinbase encountered a snag in its Solana transactions on March 17, 2024, leading to delayed sends for some users. The hiccup, described on Coinbase’s official page, occurred precisely at 12:09 PDT, marking a moment of concern among the digital currency’s holders.

A similar incident unfolded with Ethereum transactions later the same day, with delays being promptly addressed within the hour. Coinbase emphasized that activities such as buying, selling, and fiat transactions remained unaffected by these glitches.

Interestingly, this isn’t the first instance of transaction delays for Coinbase users, as similar reports emerged on Reddit three days prior, highlighting issues with crypto assets appearing “stuck” in wallets.

Amid these technical challenges, Solana not only recovered but also thrived, showcasing a 10% increase in the last 24 hours and an impressive 45% climb over the past week. On March 17, Solana outpaced Ethereum and other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based Layer-2 solutions in 24-hour transaction volume, amassing a total of $3.654 billion against Ethereum’s $2.397 billion, as reported earlier by Crypto.news.

Solana’s latest surge in price has catapulted the cryptocurrency into the spotlight, with Google Trends indicating a search popularity score of 100 for Solana, the highest in its five-year history. The peak in interest surpasses the previous record of 84 set in early September 2021.

However, Solana’s rapid ascent comes at a time when the network faces severe congestion, potentially affecting transaction processing and overall network performance. Historically, Solana has been celebrated as a fast and cost-effective blockchain solution, often dubbed as a potential competitor to Ethereum. Yet, the recent congestion and historical outages pose significant challenges, raising concerns over network reliability and the impact on Solana’s market positioning."

Teng, who became Binance CEO following the departure of the exchange’s founder Changpeng Zhao in November 2023, emphasized the substantial influx of capital from institutional investors into spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly following regulatory approval for such products earlier this year by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Expressing optimism about Bitcoin’s ongoing growth trajectory, Teng remarked that the market is “just getting started.” Initially forecasting BTC to end the year at around $80,000, Teng now anticipates the price of the cryptocurrency to grow even higher “with supply reducing and demand continuing to come through.”

Despite a recent dip below the $69,000 mark, Bitcoin has appreciated by over 55% this year, sparking concerns of a potential speculative bubble and triggering periods of volatility and sell-offs among certain investors.

However, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek characterized the recent sell-off as a “healthy move” in a CNBC interview, suggesting it serves to alleviate accumulated leverage within the market. Marszalek highlighted that current on-chain activity mirrors that of December 2020 to January 2021, noting that volatility is “actually pretty low compared to what we have seen in previous cycles.”

Crypto industry leaders generally appear to share a positive outlook for Bitcoin’s future, anticipating further growth barring unforeseen events.

Hydra, a layer-two scaling solution designed to enhance the transaction processing capacity of the Cardano blockchain at a lower cost, was rumored to have been abandoned.

Hoskinson’s message conveyed a clear stance: Hydra “has never been more productive and motivated.” See below:

Hydra within Cardano serves as an open-source framework designed for crafting off-chain ledgers. Cardano claims it offers developers enhanced efficiency in leveraging blockchain technology

By facilitating the simultaneous processing of multiple transactions, this inventive protocol operates through independent state channels known as Hydra Heads. These heads manage transactions off-chain, ensuring swift and efficient operations while upholding Cardano’s decentralized principles.

In contrast to certain scalability solutions that compromise decentralization, Hydra aims to scale Cardano’s network securely by accommodating the addition of more heads as the network expands.

While Hydra promises improved scalability and efficiency, its success hinges on adoption by developers, businesses, and users to fully harness its advantages.

The research paper published by Cardano ADA provides insights into the technical complexities of Hydra, highlighting its capability to transform blockchain technology.

The founder’s involvement aims to dispel misconceptions and highlight Cardano’s dedication to promoting interoperability with prominent chains like Ethereum.

Hoskinson also took to X to address rumors about World Mobile:

Grayscale omits Cardano from GDIF

Grayscale’s Dynamic Income Fund (GDIF) recently excluded Cardano, prompting discussions within the crypto community.

Grayscale, a renowned investment firm, introduced the GDIF as a means for staking cryptocurrencies to generate income.

The fund initially comprises assets from nine blockchains, including Aptos, Celestia, Coinbase Staked Ethereum (CBETH), Cosmos, Near, Osmosis, Polkadot, SEI Network, and Solana.

GDIF aims to distribute rewards in U.S. dollars on a quarterly basis, providing investors with exposure to multi-asset staking through a single investment vehicle.

Cardano’s absence from the fund raised questions within the community. ADA’s yield, standing at 3.05%, was comparatively lower than other projects like Osmosis and Polkadot, which had higher yields at 16.52% and 10.76%, respectively.

The decision to include Solana and Ethereum in GDIF over Cardano reflects Grayscale’s strategy to prioritize projects with high returns and market capitalization.

Solana and Ethereum, with a combined worth exceeding $540 billion, are among the most traded coins in the market, making their inclusion logical from an investment perspective.

Sitharaman says she expects the G20 — the intergovernmental forum comprised of 19 sovereign countries, the European Union (EU), and the African Union (AU) — to draft a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.

Sitharaman also highlighted that crypto assets are predominantly used for trading, speculation, and profit-making activities rather than functioning as traditional currencies issued by central banks.

Sitharaman further emphasized how cryptocurrency assets thrive on trading and speculation.

The absence of regulatory measures, Sitharaman argues, has global implications due to cryptocurrency’s potential influence on cross-border payments and illicit activities like drug trafficking or terrorism.

Sitharaman has been involved in G20 discussions to tackle the challenges presented by crypto assets, pushing for a unified global regulatory framework.

She highlighted the importance of international collaboration in crafting robust regulations that can effectively handle the risks associated with cryptocurrencies.

RBI governor warns against crypto risks

The Indian government embraces blockchain technology but maintains reservations about cryptocurrencies due to their volatility and speculative nature.

In India, cryptocurrencies lack legal tender status, and there are currently no dedicated regulations governing them.

The recent introduction of the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill underscores the government’s call for global consensus on minimal cryptocurrency regulations, emphasizing the necessity of international cooperation.

Furthermore, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has adopted a cautious approach towards cryptocurrencies, highlighting the importance of regulatory caution to safeguard financial stability.

In 2022, Governor Shaktikanta Das raised concerns about the lack of underlying value in cryptocurrencies and emphasized the need to uphold financial stability amid the increasing global popularity of cryptocurrencies.

The RBI’s cautious strategy aims to safeguard India’s financial sovereignty and mitigate potential disruptions to the banking system that could result from unregulated cryptocurrency activities.

Through issuing warnings and promoting regulatory caution, the RBI aims to maintain resilience and security within India’s financial ecosystem in response to changing digital asset environments.

Das further warned that the crypto “party” is not devoid of risks. Despite this, the RBI maintains its vigilance in tackling emerging risks and challenges, while cautiously considering the possibility of introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC)."

Reddit seeks to raise $748m

Reddit has yet to turn a profit.

During the last quarter of 2023, the company touted net income of approximately $18.5 million. It concluded 2023 with a net loss of $90.8 million.

Reddit, which seeks to raise $748 million via the IPO, plans to offer more than 15.2 million shares of its Class A common stock, accompanied by an additional 6.7 million shares offered by selling stockholders.

Reddit will also grant some of its employees the opportunity to sell shares during the IPO, a move that deviates from the typical process of imposing a lock-up period to prevent immediate selling that could negatively impact the stock price.

It will also reserve shares for top users who have good “karma,” a term the platform uses to gauge its users’ reputation on the site.

Reddit was sold to media company Condé Nast in 2006.

Co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman owns 3.3% of the company (his fellow co-founder Alexis Ohanian left the company in 2020).

Reddit’s other major shareholders include Condé Nast’s parent company, Advance Publications (30.1%), as well as Shenzhen, China-based Tencent (11%) and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (8.7%).

The decision to target a lower valuation comes amid a chilly IPO market.

So far in 2024, there have been 33 IPOs on the U.S. stock market. Per Stock Analysis, as of Sunday, March 17, this is 10% more than the same timeframe in 2023.

There were just 1,429 IPOs across the globe in 2023, according to S&P Global. That’s the lowest number since 2019, and a nearly 16% drop from 2022."

Yakovenko also acknowledged the platform’s success in a response to angel investor and ETH developer Eric Conner.

Observers, however, are debating the implications of Solana’s centralized staking system, with critics pointing out potential vulnerabilities.

In response, Yakovenko has differentiated Solana’s system from the multisig control mechanisms typical of Layer-2 solutions, aiming to address concerns about centralization.

Furthermore, the discussion has broadened to include blockchain resilience in the face of potential regulatory challenges.

Yakovenko has engaged in these conversations, suggesting that Solana could make adjustments to maintain operations under strict government regulations, thereby showcasing the platform’s adaptability.

A comparison between Ethereum and Solana became a topic of discussion following the activation of Ethereum’s EIP 4844.

On March 16, Conner — known for co-authoring EIP 1559 — remarked on the now minimal differences between Ethereum and Solana in terms of user experience.

Conner responded to views shared by Messari co-founder Qiao Wang, who had relayed insights from a longstanding Ethereum (ETH) user and expressed frustration with the current state of Ethereum, citing its slow performance and lack of refinement as major issues.

In their detailed account, Dumpster DAO highlighted that the mysterious wallet involved in the incident had not only sold off valuable NFTs but also managed to withdraw approximately $1 million in ETH, moving it to a secondary address.

In response to mounting concerns from the crypto community, particularly from those holding Milady NFTs, Fang took to social media to confirm the breach. Fang elaborated that the hack compromised multiple wallets, advising the community to beware of any suspicious communications.

Tweeting about the alleged embezzlement at the time, Fang said that the developer worked on the Bonkler project. They stated that the theft affected fees generated by Remilia from Bonkler.

Additionally, the developer also reportedly seized codebases and connived with other individuals to attempt to take control of the platform’s social media accounts.

On March 15, a Google Document titled “random probably bad ideas” surfaced as part of Bankman-Fried’s prosecutors’ sentencing submission.

Bankman-Fried’s lawyers, meanwhile, are advocating for a 50-year prison sentence as opposed to the maximum sentence of 115 years in prison.

With a 50-year sentence, Bankman-Fried would be 82 years old at the time of release.

Noteworthy among the suggestions on Bankman-Fried’s list of “random” ideas was the proposal to sit for an interview with former Fox broadcaster Tucker Carlson and publicly declare his affiliation with the U.S. Republican political party.

Bankman-Fried intended to leverage this opportunity as a way to critique the bankruptcy lawyers overseeing FTX’s fraud case and to voice his dislike of the “woke agenda.”

Bankman-Fried never appeared on Carlson’s show, which Fox News canceled in 2023.

Per the leaked document, Bankman-Fried conveyed a stark assessment, stating, “Discuss how the consortium of attorneys is eroding value and sacrificing entrepreneurs to mask the ineptitude of legal practitioners.”

The document cautions that the ideas expressed therein are unverified and potentially flawed. Bankman-Fried articulated his views in one list entry, expressing a clear focus on restoring value to customers while condemning the Chapter 11 team’s actions as detrimental.

In another entry, he criticized the team’s incompetence in managing the FTX case, characterizing it as colonial and dominated by a cabal of lawyers.

Other entries highlighted his advocacy for crypto and freedom, as well as a desire to engage in debates, including with Matt Levine, a Bloomberg financial journalist, who critiqued the defense strategy as being overly complex and potentially ineffective.

Following Bankman-Fried’s indictment on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in November 2022, he was convicted of embezzling $8 billion from clients of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX.

Prosecutors pushed for a 50-year prison sentence and an $11 billion judgment, effectively labeling his fraud as one of the largest in history.

Since his incarceration, Bankman-Fried’s conduct has drawn scrutiny. Reports surfaced in February indicating his provision of cryptocurrency investment advice to prison guards at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, signaling a departure from his earlier prison activities, such as trading canned mackerels as currency.

SBF’s future uncertain

Bankman-Fried’s sentencing is scheduled for March 28. He intends to appeal his conviction.

Prosecutors argue that his actions inflicted substantial financial harm on over a million victims, warranting a lengthy prison term.

On Feb. 28, Bankman-Fried’s lawyer advocated for a lenient sentence, emphasizing that most funds would be returned to the affected customers.

The lawyer, Marc Mukasey, suggested a prison term ranging between 5-1/4 and 6-1/2 years to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is scheduled to deliver the sentence on March 28.

Bankman-Fried’s psychiatrist and his Stanford law professor-parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, also submitted letters of support stating that their son was uninterested in material wealth.

Bankman-Fried is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and worked at Wall Street before riding a boom in the values of digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC).

His net worth — once estimated to be $16 billion — vanished when FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 following a series of customer withdrawals.

The decision now lies with U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is tasked with weighing the conflicting recommendations to determine the appropriate sentence.

The Seattle-based company informed customers of Odyssey’s sunsetting through email and in an update on its FAQ page.

“The Starbucks Odyssey Beta must come to an end to prepare for what comes next as we continue to evolve the program,” the company stated.

Starbucks has announced that they will be sunsetting their Odyssey Beta Program and closing the Discord, with the program officially sunsetting March 31st



See the full announcement: pic.twitter.com/sfTlFV0luR — The Nifty (@niftyportal) March 15, 2024

The program garnered widespread attention for its integration of blockchain technology with customer loyalty initiatives when it first launched in late 2022.

On March 31, it will officially end.

Members of the program have until March 25 to complete any outstanding activities and so-called “journeys” — a reward program of sorts where members could earn, buy, and trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs) stamps.

The first NFT collection was made up of 2,000 “Journey Stamps” and sold out within the first 20 minutes of hitting the market.

Details regarding how many jobs will now be cut are unclear.

In a heartfelt statement, the program’s community lead shared the personal impact of this decision, reflecting on the vibrant community built around Starbucks and the Odyssey program.

Despite the emotional attachment departing harder, @NFTbark shared an optimistic outlook on facing the uncertainty ahead while cherishing memories with Starbucks, like enjoying a cold brew and a birthday cake pop.

However, they made it clear that they would not be speaking on behalf of Starbucks or about the Starbucks Odyssey program further.

Starbucks: Stamps remain accessible via Nifty

Whether Starbucks lives up to its promise to “evolve” the program remains to be seen. The coffee retailer did pledge one final benefit to Odyssey members who have achieved Level 1 status or higher, which will be communicated via email by the end of March.

Furthermore, the fate of members’ accumulated points and Odyssey Stamps has been outlined. Points are set to expire with the program’s conclusion, with no additional benefit selection periods planned.

However, Odyssey Stamps will remain accessible through Nifty Gateway, and the Odyssey marketplace will transition to the Nifty marketplace, allowing for continued buying, selling, and transferring of stamps.

Stamps can be withdrawn to an external wallet for trading on other platforms. However, the dedicated Discord server for the Odyssey community will shut down on March 19, though the coffee retailer is exploring new ways to maintain community engagement.

Starbucks isn’t the only major corporation to pull the plug on its NFT programs. In October 2022, The Vault by CNN NFT marketplace project ended, as the media outlet ceased selling digital collectibles.

And in March 2023, Meta announced that it was “winding down” its work with NFTs on both Facebook and Instagram."
https://crypto.news/parallel-studios-hypes-up-ai-powered-game-on-solana/,Parallel Studios hypes up new AI-powered game on Solana,2024-03-17 13:05:30+00:00,"Ogwu Osaemezu Emmanuel, Anthony Patrick","The Web3 developers behind the popular Ethereum (ETH) NFT game, Parallel, are transitioning to Solana (SOL) for their upcoming project, Colony.

The survival simulation crypto game is powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and built on the Solana blockchain.

According to a March 14 white paper published by Parallel Studios, the Solana-powered game “pushes the boundaries of AI agents in blockchain, gaming, and even general purpose contexts.”

“Colony breaks new ground in incorporating continuous learning capabilities into gaming, and its AI avatar architecture allows for unique personalities and worldviews,” the company says.

Here’s why: The team claims the game will introduce players to autonomous AI-powered agents that evolve and make decisions on their own. Players initiate their agents by answering initial questions to establish their fundamental personality traits, but the agents can progressively develop their own goals and behaviors over time.

While owners can offer suggestions to their agents, compliance isn’t guaranteed. This introduces a science-fiction-like element: agents may interpret suggestions differently or reject them due to evolving objectives.

To earn crypto rewards, players must own an NFT avatar. While a “free-to-play” option will exist, these users won’t be eligible for ‘PRIME’ rewards, item retention, unique NFT minting, or external item transfers. However, all players, even those using the free version, will need to cover costs associated with the large language model (LLM) powering the AI.

As stated in the whitepaper, gamers must still provide funding to cover fees associated with their agent’s use of the underlying LLMs during game sessions. This mirrors the structure of the full version of Colony, where players fund their avatars’ LLM calls from deposited funds.

The whitepaper further highlights the dynamic interaction between users and their avatars within Colony’s ecosystem.

Users can suggest actions to their avatars, who respond by considering their objectives, occasionally diverging from owner suggestions if they conflict. This process may entail owners persuading or negotiating with their avatars to complete tasks.

Colony’s framework will be built upon existing Parallel Avatar NFTs on Ethereum, with additional digital collectibles planned for minting on Solana. The game will incorporate a “breeding” mechanism reminiscent of Axie Infinity’s creature generations to spawn more agents.

Players will utilize the PRIME token, bridged from Ethereum to Solana, for in-game transactions and rewards. Parallel Studios aims to release a public alpha version of Colony in either the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025.

With ongoing developments, players can expect further updates and details in the coming months, heightening anticipation for this ambitious AI-powered crypto game on Solana.

Art ownership via NFTs

Solana has become a major player in the NFT market by offering a platform that democratizes art ownership, unlocks revenue streams, and promotes financial inclusion globally.

With over 14 million wallets having held an NFT on Solana, with a low cost of minting an NFT at $0.00011, its high throughput and low fees make it appealing to NFT creators and collectors.

The platform’s NFT standard and minting program offer extensive customizability and ecosystem-wide support, enabling creators to focus on their artwork rather than developing new smart contracts.

Additionally, Solana’s price journey has been marked by significant volatility, with recent corrections following a period of remarkable performance. After reaching an all-time high of $258.93 in November 2021, Solana experienced fluctuations, dipping to as low as $23.49 in July 2021 before surging again in the second half of the year.

As of Feb. 24, sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Solana network have surpassed $5 billion in total volume. Per data from CoinGecko, Solana (SOL) is trading at $179.65 at the time of writing, representing an over 820% price incline in the past year,"

Kevin Svenson says 'yes',2024-03-16 19:58:21+00:00,"Ogwu Osaemezu Emmanuel, Anthony Patrick","Kevin Svenson a crypto analyst and professional trader, suggests Bitcoin (BTC) could reach a new all-time high of above $80,000 before the upcoming halving event.

According to Svenson, as Bitcoin enters the fourth stage of its current parabolic curve pattern, volatility is anticipated to rise. This pattern typically exhibits a staircase-like structure with four levels, where the price tends to pause and fluctuate before continuing its upward trend.

Numerous investors are expected to enter the market in anticipation of this occurrence.

However, Svenson also cautions about potential short-term risks post-halving. He highlights the possibility of a significant sell-off following the April halving, potentially causing Bitcoin to briefly dip below its previous peak before establishing a new accumulation zone.

BTC hitting $83,000?

Utilizing Fibonacci retracement and extension tools for technical analysis, Svenson proposes a potential price target of $83,000 for Bitcoin.

Furthermore, he anticipates a retracement to approximately $48,000-$49,000 before resuming its upward trajectory.

However, Svenson cautioned that Bitcoin could encounter downward pressure post the scheduled April halving. “Once the halving occurs, we could witness a significant ‘sell-the-news’ event, potentially driving prices below the all-time high,” the analyst explained.

Svenson also highlighted the likelihood of a market turnaround and the emergence of an accumulation zone below the peak before another upward surge.

Emphasizing the bullish sentiment leading up to the halving, the analyst suggested that many investors might seek to purchase Bitcoin before the event, possibly propelling prices to new records.

However, they warned that a surge in buying activity could temporarily restrict growth.

Bitcoin’s price trajectory post-Bitcoin halving

The Bitcoin halving event, a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency market, is likely to have implications for altcoins as well.

As the halving diminishes the rewards miners receive for validating transactions on the Bitcoin network, its repercussions reverberate throughout the entire crypto market, exerting influence on both Bitcoin and altcoin prices.

In November 2023, “Wolf Of All Streets” Scott Melker aligned with Standard Chartered Bank’s prediction of Bitcoin (BTC) hitting $100,000 by the end of 2024. This forecast was driven by the approval of the U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming halving event.

Standard Chartered Bank maintains its April forecast, asserting that Bitcoin (BTC) will indeed hit the $100,000 mark by the conclusion of 2024.

A pivotal factor driving this projection is the approval of multiple U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter of 2024. These ETFs, potentially encompassing both BTC and ETH, are anticipated to draw significant institutional investment.

The bank also observed that Bitcoin’s market dominance has expanded, now comprising 50% of the total digital assets market cap, up from 45% in April.

The suggested amendment would raise the fee from the current 30 million naira (approximately $18,620) to 150 million naira ($93,000). The adjustment is part of a broader set of proposed changes aimed at enhancing the regulatory framework for digital asset service providers.

The SEC also seeks to provide clearer regulatory guidelines for crypto services. This includes incorporating feedback from industry stakeholders, particularly after recent discussions with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).

The initial rules and guidelines for crypto and digital asset service providers were released by the Nigerian SEC in May 2022. However, on Friday, March 15, 2024, the commission announced its intention to modify these rules.

Under the proposed changes, the application fee for entities like digital asset exchanges, digital asset offering platforms, and digital asset custodians will see an increase from 100,000 naira ($62) to 300,000 naira ($186).

The registration processing fee will also jump from 300,000 naira ($186) to 1 million naira ($620), indicating a 234% increase.

Another significant amendment includes renaming the rules. The name would change from “New Rules on Issuance, Offering Platforms and Custody of Digital Assets” to “Rules on Digital Assets Issuance, Offering Platforms, Exchange, and Custody.”

Diplomatic friction

Meanwhile, Tigran Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen and the head of the Binance crypto exchange’s criminal investigations team, has been detained by Nigerian authorities since Feb. 26, 2024, without formal charges.

The circumstances surrounding their arrest have prompted calls for intervention by the U.S. government.

Gambaryan and a colleague were reportedly lured to Nigeria under false pretenses and subsequently taken into custody by armed individuals.

They have been held at an undisclosed location, with their passports confiscated, leading to speculations of a possible government-led effort to secure a large ransom from Binance.

The lack of clear charges and denial of legal representation for the detained individuals has led to criticisms regarding the legitimacy of their detention.

The incident not only challenges international legal norms but also puts a strain on diplomatic relations between Nigeria and the U.S., a country that provides over $1 billion in foreign aid to Nigeria annually."

The heist, which was traced back to a compromise in their private key infrastructure, underscores the escalating worries regarding security within the global defi ecosystem.

The breach, which caused a $2.4 million loss, targeted the Arbitrum chain on Mozaic, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum (ETH) designed to enhance scalability and efficiency.

https://twitter.com/Mozaic_Fi/status/1768754080271196178

Per a comprehensive report from CertiK, the breach stemmed from a targeted compromise of a private key, a crucial security element in blockchain systems.

Exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker illicitly conducted transactions via the “bridgeViaLifi” contract, typically restricted to developer wallets.

https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1768597420080848922

Upon analyzing blockchain data, it was found that an account with the suffix “50eb” initiated the malicious activity, resulting in 27 token transfers, each involving significant sums of stablecoins.

Significantly, a notable fraction of these funds were tracked back to the original account, resulting in a cumulative loss surpassing $2 million. This event serves as a clear reminder of the resourcefulness and tenacity of attackers focused on the defi sector.

Following the attack, Mozaic Finance released a statement, acknowledging the breach and detailed their immediate actions.

They revealed that all pilfered funds had been transferred to MEXC, a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, offering a glimmer of hope for asset recovery.

With confidence in the legal process and centralized exchanges’ mechanisms for handling such incidents, they hinted at a potential avenue for reclaiming the stolen funds.

Mozaic Finance’s proactive stance, alongside its collaboration with security experts and law enforcement, sets a precedent for defi platforms in addressing security breaches.

This underscores the necessity of prompt action and transparency in mitigating the repercussions of such attacks on users and stakeholders.

Crypto heists, private key vulnerability

Recent cybersecurity incidents in the defi space underscore the critical importance of safeguarding private keys to prevent unauthorized access and fund siphoning.

Cybercriminals continue to target defi platforms, exploiting vulnerabilities to compromise security protocols and execute sophisticated attacks.

Private key compromises have also emerged as a significant threat, with attackers leveraging various tactics to gain access to users’ passcodes and subsequently drain funds from platforms like PlayDapp and Unizen.

A recent PlayDapp breach amounted to over $290 million and marked one of the largest hacks in crypto history. The attack involved an unauthorized addition to the PLA token’s minting address, leading to substantial losses.

Despite attempts to negotiate with the hacker and pause the smart contract, the attacker continued to exploit vulnerabilities, minting additional tokens and laundering funds through exchanges like Paribu and HTX.

PlayDapp’s response included proposing a migration plan to introduce a new ‘PDA’ token with improved security features like multi-signature implementation.

On March 11, Unizen — another defi protocol — also suffered a hack resulting in approximately $2 million in losses. The breach exposed a critical “external call vulnerability” in one of Unizen’s smart contracts, allowing unauthorized access for fund theft.

To address the aftermath, Unizen CEO Sean Noga pledged personal funds to cover 99% of the losses for affected users, demonstrating a commitment to restitution and platform security enhancements."

The Central American nation, under newly re-elected President Nayib Bukele’s guidance, revealed its considerable Bitcoin holdings, totaling 5,689.68 BTC, currently valued at over $386 million.

This relocation into an offline vault within the nation’s borders marks the creation of the country’s first official “bitcoin piggy bank,” per President Bukele’s words.

The step not only showcases El Salvador’s commitment to leveraging cryptocurrency for economic growth but also addresses security concerns by safeguarding against potential cyber-attacks.

Since adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021, amidst International Monetary Fund (IMF) skepticism, El Salvador has been on a quest to revolutionize its economy.

By bringing cryptocurrency into the mainstream, the nation aimed to lower overseas remittance fees and bank the unbanked, a significant concern given that 70% of Salvadorans are outside the traditional financial system.

Buckley explains stance on Bitcoin ETFs

Despite facing criticism from customers and ongoing inquiries about the firm’s plans to offer them, Buckley has remained steadfast in his strong opposition to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Buckley highlighted Bitcoin’s extreme volatility and speculative nature, noting its lack of stability, reliability as a store of value, and absence of underlying cash flows found in traditional assets such as stocks and bonds.

The firm’s conservative investment strategy, which prioritizes long-term stability and diversified funds, is the basis for its reluctance to integrate Bitcoin ETFs. Vanguard’s dedication to protecting its client’s interests and concentrating on asset classes with established value and cash flows has driven this steadfast position.

In a video released by Vanguard, Buckley advised against including Bitcoin ETFs in retirement investment plans due to the asset’s volatile nature.

Buckley further argued that Bitcoin’s status as a store of value is dubious, highlighting its significant decline during the stock market crash of 2022.

“When stocks plummeted in the recent crisis, Bitcoin followed suit. This highlughts its speculative nature. It’s really challenging to consider its place in a long-term portfolio. The Vangaurd Group CEO, Tim Buckley

Following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of the first U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded investment products on Jan. 10, major investment firms eagerly entered the arena, vying to provide their clients, regardless of size, with access to Bitcoin.

However, notably absent was the Vanguard Group, the world’s second-largest private investment management fund.

Via a blog post on Jan. 6, Vanguard’s executives, including Janel Jackson and Andrew Kadjeski, reaffirmed the firm’s stance that crypto assets are primarily speculative rather than suitable for investment.

They attribute this perspective to the immaturity of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, their lack of cash flows, and the potential they hold to destabilize portfolios.

Jackson clarified that Vanguard currently has no plans to launch its Bitcoin ETF or any crypto-related products due to the current state of cryptocurrency as an asset class. When deciding on investment products, Vanguard considers various factors, including enduring investment merit and meeting clients’ needs.

Vanguard has made it clear that it does not believe that crypto has an appropriate role in long-term portfolios. However, Vanguard remains interested in blockchain technology and its potential applications beyond cryptocurrencies to improve capital markets efficiency.

Kadjeski emphasized that Vanguard prioritizes investors’ interests, offering products and services that align with their long-term goals. Vanguard says its structure aims to cater to its investor-owners, who predominantly favor a long-term, buy-and-hold approach.

Kadjeski underscored the high volatility of Bitcoin, with price fluctuations of up to 150% increase and 77% decline within three years, emphasizing the challenges of recovering from significant losses. Vanguard’s approach aims to help investors save more, trade less, and adopt a long-term perspective rather than succumb to short-term trends and portfolio churn.

Bitcoin’s rollercoaster ride

The Bitcoin price has been experiencing significant fluctuations. Since January 2024, Bitcoin surged above $60,000, hitting new highs exceeding $69,000 in March.

This surge was fueled by the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs by the SEC, marking a pivotal moment for the crypto market. SEC Chair Gary Gensler supported the approval alongside two Republican commissioners, while two Democratic commissioners dissented.

This decision also followed a federal appeal court ruling that prompted the SEC to reconsider its denial of certain products, ultimately leading to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, despite acknowledging the asset’s speculative and volatile nature.

The latest move is seen as an effort to bolster investor protection on the platform by filtering the tokens listed.

In the wake of numerous incidents where investors were defrauded by unverified digital assets involved in schemes such as rug pulls, resulting in significant financial losses, Binance aims to prevent the listing of dubious crypto projects by enhancing its listing criteria, according to Bloomberg

The exchange’s strategy includes modifying the conditions for crypto projects wishing to list their tokens, particularly concerning the “cliff period.”

The period refers to a timeframe during which a portion of the total coin supply is locked within a smart contract.

Only after this period expires do the tokens gradually become available according to a preset schedule. Market makers, essential for providing liquidity, receive allocations of these tokens but face restrictions on their withdrawal capabilities.

Notably, Binance has adjusted the required cliff period to a minimum of one year, a significant increase from the previous maximum of six months.

Additionally, the platform is reportedly seeking to reserve a larger fraction of tradable tokens for market makers, aiming to ensure sufficient liquidity.

Binance motivations for policy adjustments

“Binance does not impose lock-in periods for projects listed on our exchange,” a Binance spokesperson told crypto.news.

“Each project is able to independently decide their token vesting schedule,” the spokesperson added.

This clarification came in response to questions regarding whether Binance mandates lock-ins on a project’s token vesting period.

Further, the spokesperson elaborated on the rationale for these changes: “It is crucial to mention that the primary focus has always been to protect investors. A longer vesting schedule fosters deeper commitment in projects, thereby benefiting the users and the overall ecosystem.”

The modifications to Binance’s listing policies are not isolated efforts, but part of a broader initiative to enhance regulatory compliance and investor safety amid the platform’s recovery from a tumultuous year.

In 2023, Binance faced significant legal challenges, including a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for alleged violations of federal securities law and a substantial settlement with the Department of Justice (DoJ).

The regulatory scrutiny culminated in a $4.3 billion settlement and the resignation of co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao."

Through these acquisitions, Marathon has substantially increased its stake in its mining operations from about 3% to 53%.

As Bitcoin reached its all-time high at $73,000 earlier this month, several Bitcoin mining companies experienced a notable surge in their stock prices. Marathon Digital has particularly benefited from Bitcoin’s recent rally, as the company’s stock price is currently at $19.22, over a 170% increase from last year.

Especially for trades below $125,000, 97.5% of transactions performed on layer-2 networks were more cost-effective than those on the Ethereum mainnet, likely due to lower gas costs and higher liquidity concentration beneficial for retail traders.

The research also notes that while Ethereum accounts for 25% of total transactions, it encompasses over 60% of the volume, indicating a preference for layer-2 networks despite Ethereum’s higher transaction volume.

Additionally, layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum offer significantly shorter block times, reducing the window for market price fluctuations and making arbitrage less profitable. This ultimately benefits liquidity providers, who receive 20% higher returns from arbitrage on layer-2 networks compared to the mainnet.

However, the paper also addresses concerns regarding layer-2 networks, including centralized sequencers that may manipulate transactions for their benefit and the absence of decentralized fraud proofs in optimistic rollups necessary for correcting errors.

The proliferation of over 40 layer-2 ecosystems also leads to liquidity fragmentation, requiring reliance on bridging infrastructure, which is costly and time-consuming.

Developers are actively working to mitigate these issues, with Optimism unveiling a permissionless fault-proof system and initiatives like Espresso to diversify sequencer networks.

“For decentralized markets to fulfill their full potential, aggregate trading costs must continue to decline, and user experience must continue to improve,” Adams said. “We believe that the studied generalized layer-2s still have many benefits that users can utilize today, and any future improvements will only continue to benefit the trading experience.”"

Federal prosecutors said in a Manhattan courthouse on March 15 that Sam Bankman-Fried gambled with money rightfully belonging to Alameda and FTX customers, eventually stealing over $8 billion in cash and cryptocurrencies through his digital asset firms.

Lawyers for the government further argued that the FTX founder insists on his innocence despite being found guilty on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy by a jury last year.

His lawyers claimed he never intended to defraud Alameda and FTX customers and investors during his tenure in charge.

Bankman-Fried plans to contend his conviction and sentencing in an appeal court, while Judge Kaplan is due to sentence the former FTX CEO in a federal court on March 28.

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a managing director at JPMorgan, stated that Bitcoin’s (BTC) allocation is 3.7 times greater than that of gold, attributing this shift to the significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since the approval of these ETFs in January, over $10 billion has been invested, with the potential market size projected to reach $62 billion.

JPM Securities predicts that the spot Bitcoin ETF market could expand to $220 billion within the next two to three years, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s price.

This influx has already been beneficial, as evidenced by Bitcoin’s 45% increase in market cap in February alone. Net sales for spot Bitcoin ETFs hit $6.1 billion in February, a significant jump from January’s $1.5 billion.

The dog’s alleged owner, who has become the symbol of the Dogwifhat (WIF) meme coin, has put a famous photo of the dog up for auction as a non-fungible token (NFT) item.

The dog’s name was previously Chi-Chi, but it was later changed to Achi. The famous photograph, which became the logo of the Dogwifhat meme coin, was allegedly taken two months after its birth on Nov. 17, 2018.

“Achi’s parents captured him in an endearing hat on camera. The photo of Achi wearing a small hat instantly took the internet by storm, and now it has captured the hearts of people around the globe as a meme called wif.”

The auction has been going on for several days on the Foundation site, but it attracted the attention of the crypto community only on March 15, when the size of the bids reached staggering values. Thus, users are willing to spend several Ethereum (ETH) on an image of a dog in a pink hat.

At the time of writing, the most significant bid is 6,942 ETH, which is over $25,600 at current rates.

Earlier in March, the Dogwifhat project community raised more than $703,000 to place the dog symbol of the WIF meme coin on the screen of the MSG Sphere entertainment complex in Las Vegas.

The hype around WIF has been going on for several months now amid a rapid price increase and market capitalization increase.

In March 2023, the U.S. transferred BTC confiscated from the Silk Road hacker to Coinbase. In April, the government sold another 9,861 BTC. Then, in January, government officials announced their intention to sell some of the cryptocurrency associated with the Silk Road case. The statement mentioned assets of 2,934 BTC.

In February, the U.S. government transferred another 15,085 BTC seized after the hacked Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange. The U.S. government confiscated funds from the platform in 2016 after hacker Ilya Lichtenstein stole about $4.5 billion from Bitfinex."

Despite this brief decline, Jupiter and Solana continue to rally amid increased trading volume and positive market sentiment. SOL gained nearly 10% today, and Solana-based meme coins have experienced record-high gains throughout this bull market. Dogwifhat (WIF) reached a new all-time high of $3.47 yesterday, recording a 534% monthly growth.

Another newly launched Solana meme coin, Book of Meme (BOME), went viral on social media and has increased 560% since yesterday. The high demand for the BOME/SOL trading pair has also impacted Solana’s price today. BOME’s initial market started just below $10 million and soared to $510 million within a day of trading.

Executives involved in the Binance listing, who spoke anonymously to avoid jeopardizing business relationships, said the changes threaten their profitability and make listing new tokens prohibitively burdensome. One of them verbally complained to Binance management about the tightening of requirements. The changes began to take effect late last year, said the source, who asked not to be identified.

Now, projects seeking to list tokens on Binance must agree to a more extended cliff period—from six months to a year—during which coins cannot be sold, more must be allocated to market makers, and collateral must be paid. In some cases, the exchange requests that a more significant portion of traded tokens be assigned to market makers to ensure adequate liquidity.

“A longer vesting schedule fosters deeper project commitment, benefiting the users and the overall ecosystem.” Binance executives

Binance employees’ concerns about loss of profits are not accidental. The company’s share in the market of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in November 2023, against the background of the announcement of Changpeng Zhao‘s resignation from the post of CEO, briefly dropped to 32%, and at the end of 2023 decreased by 5% from 54.2% to 48.7%.

Although the exchange still leads the market by a wide margin over other trading platforms, its share of influence has declined after a series of problems in 2023.

Senators Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler, in a communication with SEC Chair Gary Gensler, highlighted the potential risks to retail investors, specifically citing the possibilities of fraud and manipulation in markets for smaller cryptocurrencies. They emphasized the findings of a FINRA survey, revealing that 70% of brokers’ interactions with retail investors breached fair disclosure norms, with misleading comparisons of cryptocurrency to cash and inadequate explanations of risks.

The senators critiqued the terminology used for bitcoin ETFs, suggesting it conceals critical aspects of these investments. They pointed out the heightened risk to investors from ETFs that reference less frequently traded cryptocurrencies or those susceptible to market manipulations like pump-and-dump schemes.

“Brokers’ communications falsely equated cryptocurrency with cash; in others, they provided misleading explanations of cryptocurrency’s risks,” they highlighted, stressing about the dangers of misinformation in the sector.

Additionally, Reed and Butler cautioned against allowing the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs to set a precedent for future endorsements. The senators advocated for more rigorous oversight of Bitcoin ETFs and the advisory services related to them, given the less regulated nature of other cryptocurrency markets.

Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, publicly countered the senators’ concerns, arguing that established markets for major cryptocurrencies like Ether exhibit robust metrics that compare favorably with the largest traded equities. Grewal highlighted Ether’s market depth and liquidity, asserting a direct correlation in Ether’s futures and spot markets akin to that observed in Bitcoin’s markets.

With Bitcoin’s (BTC) price retracing from its peak and dipping below $69,000, analysts at IntoTheBlock warn of the market showing signs of “being overheated,” sparking worries of a potential correction.

https://twitter.com/LucasOutumuro/status/1768504693003522227?s=20

In an X post on Mar. 15, Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, addressed the increasing leverage in both decentralized finance (defi) and centralized finance (cefi) markets, indicating a looming adjustment.

“Not only are meme tokens rocketing left to right, but the amount of leverage behind large cap assets has also quickly accelerated. This is evident in derivatives markets where borrow costs to go long have reached their highest since 2021.” Lucas Outumuro

On centralized exchanges funding rates have “abnormally high” levels, Outumuro says, adding that even though exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows may continue carrying spot prices for the moment, the overly bullish positioning in derivatives “posts a warning sign for the market.”

Moreover, the surge in leverage extends beyond centralized exchanges to defi platforms. The aggregate debt issued through Aave v3 on Ethereum has more than doubled year-to-date, Outumuro noted.

The analyst warns of a potential “Great Unwinding” in the crypto market, anticipating a 20% correction “as the amount of leverage in the system gets reset.” While the exact timing of such a correction remains uncertain, the escalating borrow costs serve as a cautionary signal for crypto investors to exercise prudence in their trading strategies, IntoTheBlock’s head of research noted. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $67,819, according to CoinGecko data."

Publicly traded Bitcoin (BTC) mining companies have traditionally served as a gateway for investors to gain exposure to the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization without directly owning it. However, the recent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has dramatically changed this dynamic.

In a statement to crypto.news, Alessandro Cecere, marketing specialist at Bitcoin mining services firm Luxor Technologie said that the market “may now be starting to price in” the fourth halving — due in mid-April — and investors are no longer utilizing stocks of public mining companies to obtain exposure to Bitcoin, as they once did.

“The market may now be starting to price in the 4th halving, and now that Bitcoin ETFs have been approved, and experienced a successful launch, investors aren’t forced to obtain exposure to Bitcoin through mining stocks, leading to a reduction in the average premium to BTC spot they used to have.” Alessandro Cecere

As crypto.news reported earlier, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju highlighted an uptick in miners’ selling activity since 2012, indicating increased selling pressure on Bitcoin.

However, Ju suggested that the current bull market would likely persist unless there is a slowdown in ETF inflows. He also noted that U.S. mining companies are not the primary Bitcoin sellers, implying that offshore or older miners may be the top sellers.

U.S. mining companies aren't major #Bitcoin sellers; the sellers are likely offshore or older miners. pic.twitter.com/H6lffwviAR — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) March 14, 2024

Addressing these developments, Cecere attributed the ability of publicly listed miners to issue new shares as a way to raise capital, which is not available to private miners. This distinction may explain why U.S.-based mining companies have not yet started selling off their crypto holdings, Cecere noted.

“With interest rates at high levels compared to the last bull market, issuing new debt is not as attractive anymore, this might explain why overseas miners are selling Bitcoin as they prepare for a significant reduction in revenues after the halving.” Alessandro Cecere

Following Ki Young Ju’s statement, Bitcoin’s price experienced a downturn, dropping below the $70,000 level late on Mar. 14. As of press time, BTC is trading at $68,230, according to CoinMarketCap."
https://crypto.news/ex-swiss-bank-director-discusses-the-future-of-bitcoin-etfs-after-record-breaking-trading-day/,Ex-Swiss bank director discusses the future of Bitcoin ETFs after record-breaking trading day,2024-03-15 07:47:42+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","Bitcoin ETFs shattered records with a 14,261 bitcoin purchase on March 12, as a former Swiss Bank Director shed light on the changing Bitcoin ETF investment scene.

On March 12, net spot Bitcoin ETF inflows surpassed $1 billion, with Blackrock’s IBIT product reaching a record $849 million inflow and exceeding 200,000 BTC in assets under management, as per reports.

The latest surge in trading activity eclipses the initial enthusiasm seen at the ETFs’ inception and establishes a new market engagement benchmark.

In a March 14 interview with Crypto.news, Clive Thompson, a retired managing director of wealth management with decades of experience in Swiss private banking, shared his insights into the cryptocurrency market following the historic launch of Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on Jan. 11, 2024. The introduction of these ETFs, including the high-profile conversion of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust into an ETF, marks a significant milestone in the evolution of Bitcoin as an asset class.

“Bitcoin became an asset class which can no longer be ignored,” Thompson stated, highlighting the watershed moment when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowed the launch of 10 Bitcoin ETFs. This move, he notes, is not an endorsement of Bitcoin as an investment but acknowledges the undeniable demand for accessible exposure to Bitcoin’s price.

The ETF launch was historic, drawing over $700 million on its first day, the highest ever for an ETF. Although Grayscale saw some early losses due to higher fees, the situation improved fast, leading to more than $11 billion invested in Bitcoin through these ETFs since they started.

What makes this development even more significant is the growing acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs among investment firms worldwide. “Investment firms all around the world are under pressure from their relationship managers to include the Bitcoin ETFs as an authorized investment,” Thompson explained. He delved into the rigorous approval process within these firms, emphasizing that despite the challenges, “little by little, these ETFs are going to be approved.”

However, Thompson also cautioned that the journey toward widespread adoption is not without its hurdles. He discussed the cautious approach many asset allocators are likely to take, initially limiting exposure to a small percentage. Moreover, not all relationship managers are convinced about including Bitcoin in client portfolios immediately, waiting for a pullback before making a move.

Despite these challenges, Thompson remains optimistic about the future flow of funds into Bitcoin ETFs, driven by a combination of increasing acceptance among investment firms and the potent allure of Bitcoin’s rising price, which has created a “fear of missing out” among investors. Since the ETF launch, Bitcoin’s price surged from $47,000 to a staggering $72,800, further fueling investment interest.

Looking ahead, Thompson predicts continued growth but also cautions investors about the potential for volatility, driven by profit-taking and external risks such as government actions or market incidents. Yet, he believes in the resilience of Bitcoin, buoyed by factors like the network effect and concerns over fiat currency devaluation.

On March 11, just a day before the record ETF purchases, the new Bitcoin ETFs acquired approximately 7200 Bitcoins. This acquisition significantly exceeded the average daily mined supply of 900 Bitcoins, contributing to a 5% price increase in Bitcoin. Thompson’s observations underscore the profound impact of ETF activities on the market.

Furthermore, Thompson highlighted Genesis Holdings’ role following its bankruptcy and subsequent liquidation of GBTC shares, starting on Feb. 28 and concluding around March 13. The liquidation indirectly influenced Bitcoin sales, and according to Thompson, the conclusion of Genesis’s GBTC share sales marked a pivotal moment with potential implications for Bitcoin’s price trajectory, hinting at a surge to new highs, which could attract more inflows into Bitcoin ETFs.

“In the long term, I see much higher prices,” Thompson concluded, reflecting on the growing network of Bitcoin holders and the inflation of fiat currencies. “The hard-wired limit of 21 million bitcoins means that it can’t be printed will-nilly like fiat currency can, making it a protection against what may happen to the currency.”"

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has brought charges against 17 individuals implicated in a $300 million Ponzi scheme, targeting predominantly Latino investors in the U.S. and two other nations.

The scheme, as detailed in a press release issued on Mar. 14, allegedly operated out of Houston, Texas, targeting over 40,000 investors across 10 states and two foreign countries with promises of substantial wealth through “risk-free” and “guaranteed” crypto and foreign exchange investments.

This action by the SEC follows its previous emergency intervention in September 2022, which halted CryptoFX’s operations and implicated its key figures, Mauricio Chavez and Giorgio Benvenuto.

According to the investigation, the 17 individuals charged, originating from Texas, California, Louisiana, Illinois, and Florida, are accused of orchestrating the CryptoFX network and enticing investors with potential returns ranging from 15% to 100%. However, funds purportedly allocated for trading were instead used “to pay commissions and bonuses to themselves and investors, and to fund their own lifestyles,” the SEC says.

The SEC has leveled various charges against the defendants, accusing them of breaking rules related to fraud, registering securities, registering as brokers, and protecting whistleblowers. Two of the defendants, Luis Serrano and Julio Taffinder, have accepted final judgments without admitting or denying guilt, the SEC noted. They’ve agreed to pay a total of over $68,000 in penalties, disgorgement, and interest."

Blockchain analytics startup Elliptic reported on March 14 that Lazarus funneled $12 million into the Ethereum-based crypto tumbler. The funds, denominated in Ether (ETH), originated from a November hack on Justin Sun’s HTX and the exchange’s cross-chain solution, Heco Bridge.

According to Elliptic and several other on-chain security firms, Lazarus orchestrated a $100 million attack on the two platforms last year. The funds remained dormant until March 13, when North Korea’s infamous hacker group began laundering stolen HTX assets.

According to Elliptic, Lazarus has made over 40 transactions into the smart-contract-based mixer in the last 24 hours.

For years, the criminal organization frequently used Tornado Cash to obscure transactions and launder illicit wealth until U.S. authorities sanctioned the service in August 2022. However, due to its decentralized design, Tornado Cash continued to operate since the government could not effect a total shutdown.

U.S. agencies targeted other Lazarus Group options like Bitcoin-based mixers Blender and Sinbad in response. These platforms differ from Tornado Cash, as developers utilized a centralized model for the design. This meant that law enforcement was able to shutter the services completely.

As crypto.news reported, citing Chainalysis data, the crackdown resulted in a 29% reduction in crypto money laundering throughout 2023, as Lazarus and other bad actors struggled to off-ramp looted funds.

However, the North Korean syndicate’s return to Tornado Cash signals a scarcity of large-scale mixers, mainly due to U.S. enforcement action and regulatory takedowns."

The idea was inspired by Ethereum’s native staking model following its PoS transition, which replaced miners with stakers as crucial network contributors. Ether.fi and similar projects give users access to additional yield and rewards, occasionally in points or airdropped tokens.

The protocols tap EigenLayer, the original restaking platform, to achieve this extra staking yield. Some users and proponents have shared skepticism about this crypto trend, citing risks to restaking platforms and Ethereum’s mainnet.

Nevertheless, the liquid restaking ecosystem has grown in leaps and bounds within a few months of its emergence. Users have deposited over $6.8 billion in total value locked (TVL) into this sector, according to DefiLlama.

However, the expert outlined the importance of community-driven solutions and technological advances to solve these problems.

The expert suggested several constructive steps to improve the scalability and efficiency of Solana.

According to CoinGecko, Dogwifhat has become the fourth meme coin by market capitalization, after giants such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE). Over the past 24 hours, the asset has grown by more than 40%.

The trader could have earned $23.2 million by selling tokens near an all-time high by holding the asset for several months.

This is not the first time investors have made large sums from meme coins. Earlier, analysts drew attention to a trader who turned an investment in WIF of $1,800 into $11 million.

A trader bought 5.1M $WIF with only a cost of $1,749 on Nov 30 and has held it to now, which is now worth $10.9M!

Another WIF trader purchased 2.58 million WIF, bringing his total profit to $4.12 million.

The growth of meme coins coincided with another wave of popularity for DOGE — its capitalization has reached $25 billion. As a result, new meme coins, launched in late 2023, before the start of the bull period in the crypto market, are generating significant returns for early investors."
https://crypto.news/uk-treasury-proposes-regulatory-overhaul-for-crypto-assets-and-money-laundering/,UK Treasury proposes regulatory overhaul for crypto assets and money laundering,2024-03-14 13:48:29+00:00,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka","The United Kingdom Treasury has released a consultation paper detailing proposed changes to money laundering regulations, with significant implications for the regulation of crypto assets.

These amendments are motivated by the outcomes of a comprehensive review of the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (MLRs) conducted in 2022. The initiative targets the implementation of “smarter regulation,” aiming to lessen regulatory burdens, ensure the longevity of regulations, and promote a regulatory environment where accountability and responsiveness are paramount.

Central to these proposed changes is the refinement of the supervisory and registration framework for crypto firms. The consultation paper emphasizes the necessity of a robust supervisory regime to bolster the effectiveness of the MLRs. Under the existing regulations established in 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) oversees institutions under both the MLRs and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA).

Notably, the paper proposes that while institutions regulated under the MLRs would require FCA regulation, they would no longer need to seek MLRs authorization. With this simplification, the treasury aims to streamline the regulatory oversight of crypto asset service providers.

The paper articulates a shift in the regulatory landscape for crypto assets. Currently, crypto assets fall under FCA jurisdiction when used as the underlying asset for regulated activities or financial instruments. The proposed regulatory amendments would broaden the FSMA’s purview to encapsulate new activities, including the operation of crypto asset exchanges and custody services. Consequently, crypto assets not previously under FCA oversight will be mandated to register with the FCA for MLRs supervision.

A major point of discussion in the consultation paper is the existing disparity between assessments conducted under MLRs and FSMA, specifically concerning the eligibility for control and control thresholds. The paper deliberates on the feasibility of maintaining two distinct standards of control or aligning MLRs requirements more closely with those of FSMA. Such an alignment would aim to unify the regulatory standards and control mechanisms across the financial industry.

As previously reported by Crypto.news, the United Kingdom also launched a consultation paper to explore the integration of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) cryptocurrency reporting standards into its legal and financial framework. The UK Treasury projects that this integration will significantly boost revenue, with an anticipated increase of £35 million ($45 million) in the fiscal period between 2026 and 2027, escalating to £95 million between 2027 and 2028.

The implementation of the OECD framework aims to augment the existing guidelines on offshore accounts, facilitating more efficient cross-jurisdictional sharing of cryptocurrency transaction data. This move is part of a broader effort to close the gaps in tax transparency caused by the rapid evolution of fintech and the expanding global crypto asset market. By aligning with international standards, the UK endeavors to fortify its financial system against the challenges posed by these technological advancements, ensuring a robust and equitable tax collection mechanism."
https://crypto.news/chainalysis-crypto-investors-saw-over-37-billion-in-gains-in-2023/,Chainalysis: crypto investors saw over $37 billion in gains in 2023,2024-03-14 13:46:44+00:00,"Wahid Pessarlay, Dorian Batycka","Data confirms that cryptocurrency investors recorded an impressive $37.6 billion in gains in 2023 despite the lackluster market performance, offsetting some of the losses incurred during the 2022 bear market.

According to a Chainalysis report shared with crypto.news, investors garnered substantial profits in ten out of the 12 months of 2023, with only August and September experiencing losses.

The downturn in August 2023, marked by Bitcoin’s (BTC) largest monthly loss of 11.28%, led to the broader crypto market’s slump, with Bitcoin plummeting to the $25,000 range and dragging down other assets. This turn of events catalyzed the losses in August.

The panic threw investors off, leading to selloffs, as most sought to hedge against any further declines. Those who demonstrated resilience succumbed to the selling pressure in September 2023, when BTC slumped below $25,000.

Data from Chainalysis indicates that investors lost $1.5 billion in August and $1.4 billion in September 2023. However, these losses were eclipsed by the gains witnessed in other months, especially in Q4 2023, when the pre-bull run phase began.

Bitcoin recorded three consecutive green monthly candles from October to December 2023, surging by 45% to close the year above the $42,000 level. This upward trend had a ripple effect across the market, allowing investors to engage in profit-taking trades.

Interestingly, about $19.5 billion, representing over 51% of the total profits in 2023, were generated in the fourth quarter of the year alone, with December witnessing the single largest monthly gains at $8.5 billion.

The total $37.6 billion gains pale in comparison to the profit of $159.7 billion witnessed in the 2021 bull run, when most assets recorded new all-time high prices. However, Chainalysis confirmed that the overall market growth in 2023 mirrored the pace recorded in 2021.

The analytics firm suggested that the disparity in gains between both years could stem from the fact that investors predominantly favored HODLing their assets in 2023, as they anticipated further price surges, given that the bull run had not yet materialized.

Investors lost $127 billion in 2022

In contrast to the profit-making years of 2021 and 2023, investors faced significant challenges in 2022 due to the bear market. The year was marred by several crises, such as the Terra and FTX implosions, which sparked widespread panic and substantial selloffs. Investors lost $127 billion in 2022.

While the gains in 2023 do not fully offset this figure, the ongoing bull run holds the potential for significant contributions. In terms of gains by country, Chainalysis found that U.S. investors reaped the highest profits, totaling $9.6 billion, with the U.K. following closely at $1.39 billion."

As two executives from Binance remain detained in Nigeria for the second week in a row without any charges publicly brought against them, the crypto exchange issued a blog post on Mar. 13, emphasizing its commitment to compliance with local laws and regulations.

In the post, Binance underscored its dedication to fostering responsible growth in Nigeria’s crypto sector, saying it has been in cooperation with Nigerian law enforcement agencies, including the Nigeria Police Force and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission at least since June 2020.

“Between June 2020 and February 2024, Binance’s financial crime compliance (FCC) teams responded to 626 information requests coming from Nigerian law enforcement agencies or related to investigations pertinent to Nigeria, with an average of 37.4 hours between submission and resolution.” Binance

At the end of the post, Binance called on Nigerian authorities to engage with crypto partners with a “proven track record of constructive collaboration,” implying its readiness to solve the recently sparked issue between the exchange and Nigerian officials.

“As the adoption of financial technology in the country accelerates, law enforcement and regulators should be able to rely on industry-leading partners with a proven track record of constructive collaboration with the authorities in Nigeria and all around the world.” Binance

The blog post was published shortly after reports indicated that Binance’s two detained executives, Nadeem Anjarwalla and Tigran Gambaryan, would remain in custody at least until Mar. 20. As crypto.news reported earlier, Nigeria reportedly seeks access to Binance’s top 100 users in the country, along with six months of transaction history.

This detention seems to be part of Nigeria’s efforts to stabilize the naira and combat currency speculation through crypto exchanges. Previously, the Nigerian government ordered telecom and internet service providers to restrict access to several crypto exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, in an attempt to address currency depreciation. In response, Binance removed the naira for trading from its platform."

The token, which saw a surge in demand following its launch on Feb. 20, achieved an all-time high of $1.18 on Feb. 28, only to fall to $0.01974 by March 13. This sharp decline has sparked discussions regarding the possibility of the project being a potential rug pull.

Source: ONI Price-CoinMarketCap

Anonify, a privacy-centric Telegram bot, claims to facilitate secure cross-chain swaps across various blockchains. It emphasizes complete anonymity, eliminating the need for personal information and ensuring the confidentiality of users’ identities. The platform’s cross-chain swap capability has been marketed as a key feature, allowing for easy token and coin exchanges between different blockchains.

Anonify’s Blast Bridge, as described by the project, aims to enhance the user experience by enabling smoother interactions between Ethereum (ETH) and the Blast Layer 2 (L2) network, according to the project’s claims. With the launch of Blast’s mainnet on Feb. 26, Anonify announced its bridging capabilities between BLAST and ETH.

The project claims this allows users to bridge assets between the two networks without the traditional 14-day waiting period required by official Blast bridges. This announcement was part of the project’s broader claims of facilitating a significant increase in liquidity inflow into the Blast Ecosystem over the last five days, intending to improve transaction efficiency and security across the ecosystem.

However, on March 1, the Anonify team addressed an issue where some users prematurely accessed the Blast L2 mainnet using an Ethereum contract address, bypassing the official bridge. The team emphasized their commitment to platform security and integrity, choosing to delay the activation of their bridge to mitigate potential risks. This stance was reinforced by their clarification regarding token transfers, countering speculation about selling activities on the chart.

By March 8, Anonify announced the impending shutdown of the Blast -> ETH bridge, citing a lack of significant demand. Despite this, the team revealed plans to repurpose the UI for a forthcoming web app designed to offer a more seamless swapping experience, aligning with their roadmap.

In a conversation with crypto.news, an investor in ONI known as “Grinding Poet” on X shared their perspective on the unsettling developments within the Anonify project.

“I mean, no genuine updates from devs, they seem to be just tax farming as there’s a 4% buy/sell tax,” Grinding Poet expressed, indicating a deep-seated concern over the developers’ intentions.

“I bought it coz they promised a fast both-way bridge for Blast, with a privacy narrative, I hoped it would be the 0x0 moment for Blast. It is not normal for projects to dump 98%+ at launch of the chain they are supposed to be a mascot of,” Poet added.

Further elaborating on the developments, Grinding Poet posited that the developers “farmed everyone,” a sentiment exacerbated by the recent announcement of the bridge’s suspension. According to the investor, this action has significantly depressed the price, adding that “surely insiders sold” while “most outsiders are still holding” onto their assets. Grinding Poet, holding a “sizable investment” in ONI, voiced these concerns amid a burgeoning sense of frustration within the ONI investor community.

“If you ask me, Snup has a plan. He could leave but didn’t and fixed websites problem. He stopped communicating with us and being more focused on other things. I mean he was checking the chat etc! Give him some time he will announce and update the project. At this point we cannot do anything! Just waiting for him. Dont put pressure on him at this point. hes a human too… you feel me?,” wrote Mo, an investor in the Anonify telegram group.

Meanwhile, another Investor, going by Mr Castiel, also echoed similar sentiments, adding:

“Ok, it’s pretty weird all went dark for few days, but it has working product up and running [..] Currently, mc [market cap] is 100k. I Mean. 100k it’s not even a great risk at this point. People here are talking: ‘when it hits 1 million, I’ll buy back in???’ That’s missing a 10x. Afaik 100k is bottom. Rock bottom. Opportunity of a lifetime or break even. “

Crypto.news also conducted an examination of the project’s Telegram group, witnessing further complaints from some users. While criticisms highlighted concerns over project management and the absence of marketing efforts for a project with an operational product, others showed support for the project’s anonymous creator, “Snup,” viewing the current market cap as a potential investment opportunity.

Crypto.news reached out to Snup devs, but has yet to hear back.

At the time of writing, the token was priced just $0.02474, down 97.9% from its all-time high price."

The figure not only surpasses the initial enthusiasm witnessed during the ETFs’ launch but also sets a new high for market engagement. The method for calculating these Bitcoin purchases involves dividing the daily monetary inflow by Bitcoin’s average price, highlighting the ETFs’ significant role in the market.

After experiencing a downturn in inflows that coincided with a reduction in Bitcoin’s price, the ETFs have shown a strong rebound. Current trends indicate not just a recovery but an ongoing increase in investments. This surge in demand for Bitcoin through ETFs, contrasted with the daily new supply from mining at approximately 900 bitcoins, is contributing to an upward movement in Bitcoin prices. This gap is expected to expand with the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will reduce the daily mining output to 450 bitcoins.

In a March 14 post on LinkedIn, Clive Thompson, a former managing director of wealth management with a background in Swiss Private Banking, noted a potential link between the increase in Bitcoin holdings by ETFs and the rise in the cryptocurrency’s price.

This suggests that ETF activities could play a crucial role in Bitcoin’s market movements. Despite price fluctuations, Bitcoin’s overall trend remains positive, supported by a high Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index at 91, indicating a strong market sentiment.

The market is currently driven by two main factors: the anticipation of the Bitcoin halving event, which is predicted to initiate the next bull cycle, and the continuous interest in ETFs. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs has been particularly significant, attracting institutional investment and increasing the cryptocurrency’s mainstream appeal.

According to Kaiko Research, liquidity depth in the Bitcoin market has hit a new high, with a notable imbalance between bids and asks in order books, suggesting a trend of profit-taking among traders. Despite this, high refinancing rates indicate sustained demand for Bitcoin.

The rising interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, both from institutional and retail investors, is making a noticeable impact. With Bitcoin ETFs nearing $60 billion in assets under management (AUM) and rapidly closing the gap with Gold ETFs, which stand at about $98 billion, the momentum suggests a potential shift in investment preferences.

Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg Intelligence points out that all 10 Bitcoin ETFs are likely to surpass Gold ETFs in AUM. The least ranked among them, WisdomTree‘s BTCW, already manages $74 million, placing it in the top 15% of the 108 ETFs launched in 2024, signaling a strong market acceptance and growth potential for Bitcoin ETFs."

Following an extended period of anticipation, the Dencun upgrade finally went live on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, as confirmed by Ethereum Foundation Protocol Support Tim Beiko.

According to data provided by Dune, L2 protocols utilizing blob transactions have experienced a significant decrease in transaction fees, with platforms such as Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum seeing some of the largest drops shortly after Dencun went live.

As of March 11, Optimism had an average transaction fee of $1.587, while Base recorded a figure of $1.927, data from Dune confirms. However, these values have dropped substantially, with Optimism and Base both recording an average transaction cost of $0.035 at the reporting time.

This change represents a massive 97.7% drop in Optimism’s fees and a 98.8% decline in the value witnessed with Base. Zora also recorded an impressive slump, as fees collapsed 99% from $1.423 on March 11 to $0.003 at the time of writing, per data from Dune.

Starknet saw similar drops, with the average cost for in-app swaps on Argent X, a Starknet wallet, slumping from $6.82 a few days ago to $0.04 shortly after Dencun went live. It bears mentioning that the Starknet Foundation also promised to introduce a mechanism for fee reduction in parallel with Dencun.

For the uninitiated, the Dencun upgrade seamlessly merges the “Cancun” and “Deneb” updates. It aligns with Ethereum’s roadmap known as “The Surge,” with a primary focus on bolstering the network’s scalability.

The upgrade introduces a novel concept called “proto-danksharding” (EIP-4844), aiming to fine-tune gas fees and enhance data management for layer-2 networks and rollups.

Dencun’s ultimate goal is to reduce transaction costs while boosting throughput across the Ethereum ecosystem. Notably, this objective could be achieved through a type of transaction called “shard blob transactions,” introduced with EIP-4844.

The Ethereum ecosystem has witnessed the utilization of over 4,000 blobs so far. While other layer-2 protocols have swiftly implemented these blob transactions, Arbitrum plans to join the party with the upcoming launch of its ArbOS hypervisor. Meanwhile, Blast saw a 1-hour downtime due to issues related to Dencun."

The Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), has imposed an administrative fine of €2,850,000 (around $3.1 million) on Foris DAX MT, a parent company of Crypto.com, saying the company violated the local anti-money laundering rules and anti-terrorist financing act.

According to a press release on Mar. 13, companies providing crypto services in the Netherlands are required to register with DNB under the anti-terrorist financing act. Failure to comply with this requirement carries penalties.

Bitcoin miners often sell their holdings before halvings to secure profits, mitigate price volatility risks, diversify their assets, and reinvest in mining infrastructure, leading to increased market volatility leading up to and following halvings.

Analysts, however, are confident that even the increased selling activity by miners is unlikely to impede Bitcoin’s upward momentum, given the substantial inflow of fresh capital through spot ETFs. Coinbase Research analysts have suggested that the current price surge “is only the beginning of a longer bull run,” adding that “multi-billion dollar net inflows [into spot Bitcoin ETFs] in just two months have irrevocably altered the landscape.”

The significant price increase occurred shortly after Musk, speaking at the Berlin Gigafactory, responded affirmatively to an inquiry about purchasing Tesla cars with Dogecoin. “When can you buy Tesla with Dogecoin? At some point, I think we should enable that,” Musk stated during the interaction, which was later shared on X by user @dogeofficialceo.

Meanwhile, speculation surrounds the X app and its potential integration of cryptocurrencies following the establishment of an ‘XPayments’ account for an upcoming payment feature. Expected by mid-2024, the specifics of whether this feature will include cryptocurrency payments remain unconfirmed.

Despite Musk’s recent support for Dogecoin, he has expressed a diminished interest in cryptocurrencies more broadly, along with clarifying last year that X would not launch its own crypto token."

CipherTrace, a blockchain analytics firm acquired by Mastercard in 2021, appears to be discontinuing some of its key services, Fortune has learned, citing sources familiar with the matter. While the exact reason behind the move remains unclear, the California-based blockchain firm appears to have suspended the following services:

Armada, a tool that helps banks, payment providers, and regulators uncover virtual currency-related transactions for use in risk and fraud models by mapping legal names and account numbers to exchanges.

Inspector, a repository of attribution data ties crypto-addresses to real-world organizations, sanctioned entities, IP addresses, and events.

Sentry, a tool designed to track in real-time “know your transaction” (KYT) for compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) regulations.

The report highlights that this recent development follows Mastercard’s decision to retract the expert testimony of Jonelle Still, CipherTrace’s Director of Investigations and Intelligence, in the Bitcoin Fog case. Still had previously stated that Chainalysis’ attributions were “unverifiable” and criticized the prosecution’s investigation as “massively incomplete.”

However, Mastercard later withdrew Still’s testimony, asserting that the data she relied on was “unverifiable and unauditable,” originating from pre-acquisition data collection practices, Fortune pointed out. Crypto.news reached out to CipherTrace for comment and will update the article if we hear back.

Earlier findings by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) reveal substantial variations in blockchain data mapping among different on-chain analytics providers.

In July 2021, FATF issued a report comparing peer-to-peer transaction data from seven blockchain analysis firms: Chainalysis, CipherTrace, Coinfirm, Elliptic, Merkle Science, Scorechain, and TRM Labs. The comparison highlighted significant discrepancies in the data provided by these companies, leading FATF to acknowledge the challenge of drawing definitive conclusions from the presented graphs."

District Judge Edgardo Ramos denied motions to dismiss filed by Gemini crypto exchange and crypto lender Genesis in a U.S. SEC complaint submitted over an Earn program hosted by both firms until late 2022.

In a March 13 court order, Judge Ramos said that the SEC provided sufficient grounds to allege that Gemini and Genesis violated U.S. securities rules.

The ruling issued in a Southern District of New York courthouse cited the Howey Test and Reves Test, referenced by the commission, as adequate justification for qualifying the Earn program under existing securities rules.

At this stage, under both tests, the Court finds that the complaint plausibly alleges that Defendants offered and sold unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program. As a result, Defendants’ motions to dismiss are denied. Judge Edgardo Ramos

Genesis, in particular, has previously attempted to dismiss the SEC’s complaints, claiming Gemini’s Earn program operated under a loan creation model rather than securities contracts.

According to the BNB chain, BEP 336 will significantly decrease transaction costs and boost network performance. This development coincides with Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade going live on the mainnet today, marking a significant day for blockchain technology.

The upgrade introduces “Blob-Carrying Transactions” (BlobTx), enabling large data chunks up to 128 KB to be stored temporarily and cost-effectively. This approach simplifies the transaction verification process on the network. BNB Smart Chain (BSC) enhances efficiency by verifying data accuracy within blobs rather than each transaction individually. The feature is especially beneficial for opBNB, the layer 2 network of the BNB ecosystem.

The proposal, “Defining Larger Participants of a Market for General-Use Digital Consumer Payment Applications,” aims to regulate nonbank financial companies processing over five million transactions annually, similar to the regulatory requirements for banks and credit unions.

During the hearing, some House Financial Services subcommittee members expressed concerns about the CFPB overstepping its bounds. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb, questioned the legality of the CFPB claiming jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies with minimal legal basis.

Conversely, Democrats like Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass, argued for the necessity of CFPB oversight due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, which has led to significant investment losses.

“There’s a huge amount of risk and volatility in that, and yet there are some who say there’s no risk-based reason for the CFPB to venture into this,” Lynch said.

The rule explicitly mentions cryptocurrencies several times and has been criticized for allegedly extending the CFPB’s reach into areas like crypto transactions and self-hosted wallets without clear jurisdiction.

Witnesses and lawmakers, including House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., and Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., have voiced concerns over the rule’s vague implications for digital assets.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility has long been a key point for traditional investors to dismiss the largest cryptocurrency as a first-class asset. Investors typically view first-class assets as stable, less risky, and offering consistent returns. Examples include government bonds from stable countries, blue-chip company stocks, and top-rated corporate bonds.

However, a recent analysis showed that despite its inherent volatility, BTC has seen annual price declines in only four years since its debut in 2009. This means the cryptocurrency has outpaced major fiat currencies like USD in purchasing power, which has remained inflationary yearly.

At the latest Web Summit Qatar, Gracy Chen, managing director of Bitget, and Silvina Moschini, founder of Unicoin, provided compelling insights into this evolution.

Bitcoin’s resilience cannot be downplayed

Chen highlighted two pivotal moments contributing to Bitcoin’s ascent. First, the SEC approved a spot Bitcoin ETF in January, signaling a monumental shift, welcoming institutional money into the crypto domain.

The approvals democratized access for retail investors and enticed traditional financial players to allocate a portion of their portfolios to crypto. Additionally, macroeconomic factors, such as anticipated interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, continue to drive the leading cryptocurrency and other risk assets.

Moschini emphasized BTC’s undeniable traction, underscoring its appeal across demographics, notably among women in markets like Mexico, where they constitute the majority of crypto holders. This shift towards digital assets, coupled with Bitcoin’s resilience and return profile, is building trust among investors.

Especially in developing countries where fiat currencies have seen major inflation in recent years, BTC has showcased stable growth from year to year, which appeals to the long-term investment mindset. This was evident recently as the coin hit an all-time high in countries like Argentina and Turkey nearly three weeks before it did on the global market.

Both speakers concurred on the significant role of institutional investors, propelled by regulatory advancements and product innovations such as ETFs. According to Chen, this institutional foray complements the growing interest from retail segments, thereby broadening Bitcoin’s investor base.

Amidst enthusiasm, caution remains present. Chen and Moschini advocate for diversification and prudent investment, emphasizing the volatility of the crypto markets. Moschini’s venture, Unicoin, takes a regulated approach, backing its value with real assets to mitigate risk, showcasing the evolving sophistication in crypto investment vehicles.

The two also discussed the global shift in crypto dynamics, noting a pivot towards Asia as a burgeoning hub for blockchain innovation. Regulatory clarity and a conducive investment environment in regions like Singapore, Hong Kong, and Dubai are drawing attention away from traditional Western markets.

Both leaders see promising trends in tokenizing real-world assets and the emergence of regulated digital currencies. The developments suggest a maturing market that balances innovation with investor protection.

In conclusion, conversations at Web Summit Qatar 2024, underpinned by BTC’s recent achievements, underscore its potential trajectory towards being a first-class asset.

This growth comes amid expectations of forthcoming advancements in the Aegis AI ecosystem, as noted by a crypto influencer known as Jolly Green Investor. The influencer’s enthusiasm was shared in a statement highlighting Aegis AI’s imminent introduction of its AI-based security tools, designed to address vulnerabilities in the crypto domain. These tools include AI-powered smart contract audits, token legitimacy audits, protocol monitoring, and bug bounty programs, all part of the soon-to-launch Aegis AI dApp.

According to the crypto influencer, the surge in AEGIS token value is closely linked to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s emphasis on the need for AI in smart contract auditing and bug detection.

Via an X post on Feb. 19, Buterin expressed his optimism about the use of AI for formal verification of code and identifying bugs, pinpointing this as one of the most significant technical risks currently faced by Ethereum. He advocated for AI’s potential to revolutionize this aspect, marking a significant stride towards enhancing security and reliability.

As such, Jolly Green highlighted that Buterin’s encouragement for Ethereum projects to develop AI-based solutions, combined with the growing anticipation around the Ethereum ETF, positions AEGIS uniquely at the forefront of addressing these challenges.

Further insights were provided by a user responding to the influencer, referencing a recent AMA that unveiled additional features of the Aegis ecosystem. These features include a Bitsensor subnet, an operating system, a DePIN ecosystem, and SKL-based licensing, among others. This expansion introduces new revenue streams for AEGIS token holders, offering them an 80% revenue share.

The surge in AEGIS price comes as cryptocurrencies linked to AI, such as Fetch.ai, have demonstrated resilience and substantial growth, marking significant price increases amid a widespread market downturn. Further, a recent Coinbase report highlighted that AI-affiliated cryptocurrencies have surpassed the performance of major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether since the start of the last quarter of 2023.

Additionally, these tokens reportedly outperformed major AI-related stocks, including Nvidia and Microsoft, during the same period, underlining the growing role and potential of AI in the cryptocurrency sector."

Bitcoin has finally entered the fourth cycle in its history as its price keeps growing beyond the $70,000 mark, Glassnode analysts said, adding that the interest surrounding the cryptocurrency appears to be transitioning it into the euphoria zone.

According to on-chain data analysis, the Bitcoin Realized Cap, a measure of the total wealth stored in BTC on-chain, has surged to a new high of $504 billion, experiencing a $40 billion increase in capital inflows since Mar. 1 alone.

“From an on-chain data perspective, this moment has historically triggered a distinct shift in investor behaviour patterns, particularly in the relative balance between HODLers and the Speculator cohorts.” Glassnode

The Realized Cap is currently increasing at a rate of $54 billion per month, analysts say, adding that Bitcoin is now approaching levels last seen during the early 2021 bull run. This underscores the significant capital inflows into Bitcoin, partly fueled by the success and demand for new spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier in January.

“Across numerous metrics, the current cycle is surprisingly and eerily similar to previous all-time high breaks, with the transfer of wealth from HODLers to new investors and speculators well under way.” Glassnode

However, Glassnode noted that this week, a significant level of realized profit has been locked in through on-chain spending, surpassing “statistically high levels,” with analysts highlighting parallels to the onset of previous euphoric phases, such as those seen in the 2017 and 2021 bull markets."

The paris include COMP/TUSD, EDU/TUSD, and PENDLE/TUSD. This decision follows the platform’s routine assessment of trading pairs, aimed at maintaining market quality by considering factors such as liquidity and volume.

The changes are scheduled for March 15, 2024, at 03:00 UTC, affecting not only these pairs but also others like ARPA/BNB and EDU/BNB. Despite the delisting, Binance added that the base and quote assets of these pairs will remain accessible through other trading options on the site.

Additionally, the exchange said it would discontinue Spot Trading Bots services for these pairs concurrently with the trading halt.

This development followed closely on the heels of TUSD’s deviation from its peg to the US dollar earlier this year. As previous reports suggested, an imbalance in TUSD trading on Binance was observed on Jan. 15, 2024, with sell orders surpassing buy orders by over $142 million.

This disparity resulted in TUSD’s value falling to as low as $0.984.This imbalance was further highlighted within a 24-hour trading window, where TUSD sell orders amounted to more than $339.2 million against $296.8 million in buy orders, leading to a net outflow of $42.3 million.

Further scrutiny into TrueUSD’s operations surfaced on Jan. 10, with issues reported concerning the real-time attestation of its reserves. This prompted speculation about the stablecoin’s backing, as failures in its API were noted, impairing the provision of a US dollar valuation for its collateral assets.

However, the TrueUSD team attributed the depegging event to specific activities on Binance Launchpool. They indicated that recent mining activities created short-term arbitrage opportunities, which they deemed normal aspects of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments. The team assured that redemption mechanisms involving collaborations with global banks were fully operational, facilitating uninterrupted transactions for users.

However, a Kaiko research report revealed that TUSD was no longer utilized for mining activities on Binance Launchpool, marking a significant shift in stablecoin’s engagement with the platform. According to the report, this was a core reason for the devaluation of the Stablecoin."

The figure starkly contrasts with the average daily mined supply of 900 Bitcoins. Thompson pointed out that this imbalance between demand and new supply led to a 5% increase in Bitcoin prices.

He highlighted the role of Genesis Holdings in the market dynamics. Following its bankruptcy, Genesis Holdings began liquidating its GBTC shares, indirectly influencing Bitcoin sales. These sales, which commenced on Feb. 28, appeared to conclude around March 13, according to Thompson. He suggested that the completion of Genesis’s GBTC share sales could have significant implications for Bitcoin’s price trajectory, anticipating a potential surge to new highs, which in turn could see more inflows into Bitcoin ETFs.

On March 12, Balchunas pointed out, the market experienced its second-highest trading volume day for the ten spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking the best day in the past five weeks with a total volume of $8.5 billion.

The volume surpassed that of all but five stocks. Specifically, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, saw an extraordinary level of activity, doubling the trading volume of SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD). Furthermore, other ETFs like VanEck’s HODL and Invesco Galaxy’s BTCO witnessed substantial trading volumes of $150 million and $250 million, respectively, which were significant achievements for these funds.

The success of IBIT has spurred further interest in Bitcoin ETFs, with BlackRock, under Larry Fink’s leadership, seeking regulatory approval to expand its cryptocurrency offerings. This includes proposals for additional spot Bitcoin ETFs and inclusion in its Global Allocation Fund, alongside efforts to extend its reach to emerging markets in Latin America through the launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF’s Depositary Receipts in Brazil.

However, the journey for new cryptocurrency ETFs, including those for Ethereum (ETH), faces regulatory challenges. The SEC’s hesitation to approve or deny these filings until May has sparked speculation among experts regarding the likelihood of approval.

The absence of dialogue between the SEC and ETF issuers such as BlackRock has been identified as a key factor contributing to this uncertainty. Despite this, there is anticipation for upcoming meetings that could potentially influence the SEC’s stance on these innovative financial products."

Tapping multichain technology for Ethereum scalability

As Ethereum cannot be scaled infinitely without running into the blockchain trilemma, layered multichain solutions have proven to be an efficient path forward for long-term scalability, Urosevic shared with crypto.news.

Over the years, the developer community has worked on many solutions for scaling Ethereum. While each of them has its benefits, optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups are the most promising, efficient, and secure ones. Nebojsa Urosevic, Tenderly’s co-founder and SVP

Tenderly’s co-founder said Ethereum’s Dencun will incentivize these rollups to launch even more general-purpose and application-specific chains to cater to different types of users. This seamless tooling portability, made cheaper by tackling throughput cost via Dencun, will be important to web2 companies as defi onboards more traditional firms en masse, according to Urosevic.

Improving developer infrastructure for widespread adoption

Tenderly’s SVP remarked that evolving multichain ecosystems will ultimately foster additional levels of complexity. However, the software veteran said providing web3 developers with standardized tools and practices while lowering the entry barrier for web2 builders could facilitate a frictionless community for innovators.

Should Dencun deliver on its promises, this solution would become easier to realize, Urosevic suggested.

On Tuesday, a deliberation that lasted approximately two days led the jury to find Roman Sterlingov responsible for obscuring the origins of crypto transactions, thereby complicating efforts to trace the financial proceeds from criminal endeavors. The prosecution argued that Bitcoin Fog had been instrumental in masking over $400 million in transactions, with $78 million directly tied to notorious dark web marketplaces.

Sterlingov’s conviction marks another significant victory in the United States’ intensified efforts to combat cryptocurrency-related criminal activities. The series of legal actions also includes the notable conviction of FTX’s co-founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, and the latest settlement with Binance.

Further evidence presented by the prosecution suggested Sterlingov engaged in minor transactions from an account under his name, purportedly to test Bitcoin Fog’s operations before its 2011 launch. Sterlingov admitted to using Bitcoin Fog but denied collecting any fees, contrary to the prosecution’s assertions.

Sterlingov’s case underscores the growing concern over cryptocurrency’s role in money laundering, especially through services designed to anonymize transactions. A recent report by Chainalysis for 2024 highlights a worrying trend of increased laundering activities via crypto mixers.

The report sheds light on the dominant role of transactions linked to sanctioned entities, accounting for 61.5% of all tracked illicit transactions, amounting to $14.9 billion in 2023. Many of these transactions involve cryptocurrency services under sanctions by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) or are based in sanctioned jurisdictions.

The company also expanded its BTC ETF footprint outside the U.S. to emerging markets in Latin America. BlackRock launched the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF’s Depositary Receipts in conjunction with Brazil’s B3 stock exchange.

Sterling points out that the acceleration of debt accumulation began with George W. Bush and continued through the previous three presidencies. Significant milestones were crossed in response to military spending, tax cuts, the Great Recession, and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.

Armstrong responds to this fiscal trajectory by advocating for Bitcoin as a counterbalance. The Coinbase CEO suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) represents a return to a form of financial discipline reminiscent of the gold standard abandoned in 1971.

Armstrong argues that cryptocurrency could serve as a crucial check on the continuous growth of deficit spending, which he views as pivotal for maintaining the strength of the U.S. and its currency.

This is (in part) why Bitcoin matters. It’s a return to the gold standard that we left fully in 1971. A return to financial discipline.

The mini trust aims to offer a more cost-effective option to the company’s existing $28 billion GBTC spot Bitcoin ETF. The proposal, detailed in a recent SEC filing, outlines Grayscale’s strategy to fund this new offering by reallocating a portion of the shares from its GBTC ETF.

The introduction of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust aims to lower the aggregate fees for current GBTC investors, promising them a reduction in expenses without the burden of capital gains tax for transitioning to the new fund. The proposal is particularly significant given that avoiding capital gains tax has been a critical factor in keeping investors attached to the GBTC despite its higher fees than competitors.

Today, Grayscale submitted a Form S-1 for a new spot Bitcoin ETF called Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

While the specific fee structure for the new mini trust has yet to be announced, insiders suggest it will be in line with the lower end of the market, positioning it as a competitive alternative among existing Bitcoin ETF offerings.

The GBTC has maintained its dominance in the market, even converting from a closed-end fund to an ETF, despite its higher fee rate of 1.5%. The rate contrasts the lower fees offered by competitors such as Franklin Templeton Digital Holdings Trust (EZBC) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which charge 0.19% and 0.2%, respectively.

The launch of a standard and a mini version of an ETF within the industry is a well-established practice that aims to cater to a broader range of investor preferences and financial capabilities.

Despite a significant outflow of over $10 billion from the GBTC since the approval of several spot bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year, the value of the main fund has remained stable. This stability is attributed mainly to the bullish crypto market, which has offset the impact of these outflows."

“The seizure of $1.4 million worth of Tether (USDT) marks a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to uphold integrity in this rapidly evolving industry.” Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether

According to Tether, the scam targeted mainly senior citizens throughout the United States.

The victims were then tricked into thinking their bank accounts were at risk, leading to the funds being converted into cryptocurrency to protect them from hackers. These funds were transferred to virtual currency wallets controlled by the attackers.

BitMEX Research initially labeled this exodus a record outflow. However, they later clarified that it was a historic high in terms of the Bitcoin price. The assertion from BitMEX faced scrutiny as GBTC had previously seen outflows surpassing $500 million during five days in January and again on February 29.

These figures are part of a broader trend of diminishing holdings for Grayscale, which have declined by 36% since the trust transitioned into a spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in January.

Since its transformation into a spot ETF, GBTC has witnessed consistent outflows, reaching a total of $9.26 billion, as previously reported by Crypto.news. The new structure of the ETF has enabled investors to redeem shares for Bitcoin directly, a feature not available in its previous format. This shift, coupled with GBTC’s higher fees compared to competitors such as BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC, has contributed to the ongoing outflows.

The proposal is part of the “Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue Proposals,” aiming to broaden the tax base to include digital assets, which are currently only covered under broker and cash transaction reporting guidelines. The administration plans to levy an excise tax on firms engaged in digital asset mining, covering both owned and leased computing resources.

Crypto mining companies will be required to document the quantity and type of electricity consumed, with a specific focus on the value of electricity if it is purchased from external sources. Additionally, entities that lease computational capacity must report the electricity value provided by their lessors, which will be used to calculate the tax base.

The implementation of this tax is slated to occur in phases, starting at 10% in the first year, escalating to 20% in the second year, and settling at 30% from the third year onwards. This phased approach also applies to companies generating their own electricity or those obtaining power “off-grid,” who will face a 30% tax on the estimated costs of their electricity consumption.

The proposal has sparked a debate within the crypto community and beyond. Pierre Rochard of Riot Platforms has critiqued the proposal, suggesting it aims to hinder Bitcoin’s growth and facilitate the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). According to Rochard, the tax would apply universally, even affecting miners who utilize renewable energy sources, raising questions about the proposal’s fairness and intentions.

U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis has publicly opposed the tax, arguing that it could significantly impact the cryptocurrency industry’s development in the United States. She shared her concerns on X, indicating that while the government’s recognition of cryptocurrency in the budget suggests a positive outlook on the industry, the proposed tax rate could potentially cripple it.

The tax is part of President Biden’s wider agenda to regulate and generate revenue from the digital asset market. This includes measures such as enforcing wash trading rules and enhancing reporting requirements, which are projected to generate significant revenue. According to government estimates, these measures could contribute over $42 billion to the national treasury over the next decade.

Specifically, integrating digital asset transactions with wash sale and mark-to-market rules is expected to bring in over $1 billion and $8 billion, respectively, by 2025, contributing substantially to the national budget. Additionally, the proposed excise tax on crypto mining is projected to reduce the national deficit by around $7 billion within the same timeframe.

Despite its potential for revenue generation, the proposal faces opposition from Congressional Republicans, who criticize the budget’s focus on increased spending. A joint statement by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders condemned the budget as a continuation of the administration’s “reckless spending,” warning it could accelerate America’s decline.

This budget proposal and the discussions surrounding it arrive at a time of intense political activity following Super Tuesday and President Biden’s recent State of the Union Address. The proposal, therefore, not only reflects fiscal policy considerations but also sits at the intersection of political debate and the evolving regulatory landscape for digital currencies."

Leading Thailand-based daily newspaper Bangkok Post disclosed this in a report today, citing recent comments from Pornanong Budsaratragoon, the Secretary-General of the office of the Thailand SEC.

Notably, Budsaratragoon revealed yesterday that the SEC agreed in its board meeting last week to give Thai private asset management firms the approval to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. This move comes on the back of the success recorded by these products in the U.S. market.

Before now, the regulation around investment managers in the country made no provisions for crypto ETFs. Budsaratragoon highlighted the persistent calls from these Thai-based asset managers to allow them launch products in crypto.

The Thailand SEC Chief emphasized that the regulatory agency had to first evaluate the possibility of granting these firms exposure to digital assets, citing the inherent risks associated with them. These concerns often stem from the heightened volatility native to the crypto scene.

Following a careful consideration of the necessary factors, the agency has now adjusted its rules to accommodate spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to Budsaratragoon. Notably, South Korean authorities are also reviewing the approval of the products.

In Thailand, companies dealing in securities have the authority to facilitate trading in all assets regarded as securities by the country’s SEC. The recent rule change has classified spot Bitcoin ETFs as securities, giving these companies the greenlight to trade them.

The recent rule change comes amid the growing demand commanded by spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., with the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) seeing a record $788 million inflow on March 6. Interestingly, IBIT recently hit $10 billion in AUM, quicker than any ETF in the history of the U.S. This figure has since surged past $12 billion.

Market analysts have attributed the ongoing Bitcoin rally to a confluence of factors which include the demand triggered by the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Amid the upsurge, Bitcoin (BTC) clinched a new all-time high above $72,000 yesterday."

In a recent interview with CNBC, Dimon highlighted ongoing issues surrounding crypto’s involvement in illicit activities such as fraud and terrorism. Despite these concerns, he emphasized his willingness to defend individuals’ right to purchase cryptocurrencies, although he personally seems hesitant to do so.

“I don’t know what the Bitcoin itself is for, but I defend your right to smoke a cigarette, I’ll defend your right to buy a Bitcoin. I won’t personally ever buy a Bitcoin.” Jamie Dimon

In a seed funding round in February 2023, the startup raised $19 million, with Dragonfly Capital leading the investment and numerous other investors participating, such as Finality Capital, Placeholder Capital, Shima Capital, and Lemniscap.

If successful, the $200 million funding round would mark one of the largest deals in the blockchain industry for 2024, comparable to Islamic Coin, a Shariah-compliant crypto asset based in Switzerland, which secured $200 million from ABO Digital in 2023, according to data from Crunchbase.

Orderbook exchanges, preferred for their direct trading environment, contrast with Automated Market Makers that use liquidity pools and mathematical models for trading. However, decentralized exchanges have faced challenges in liquidity, leading to a shift towards orderbook models.

Elixir addresses this by allowing liquidity provision to exchange pairs, rewarding users in the process. The network supports a substantial share of liquidity on exchanges like Vertex, Bluefin, RabbitX, and is set to integrate with platforms including dYdX and ApeX.

Following the heightened whale activity, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also hiked from 62 to 72 over the past day, per Santiment data. The indicator suggests that XRP is slightly overheated at this point and high price volatility would be expected.

For XRP to remain bullish, its RSI would need to cool down below the 60 mark.

Data from Santiment shows that the XRP price-daily active addresses (DAA) divergence dropped to negative 29% at the reporting time. When the number of active addresses declines while an asset’s price increases, the price DAA divergence indicator shows a sell signal.

On the other hand, XRP’s total open interest (OI) surged from $635 million to $845 million over the past 24 hours. Surprisingly, the XRP Binance funding rate also increased from 0.05% to 0.08% in the same timeframe.

On Monday, Hill urged a proactive approach to blockchain technology, indicating that current regulatory stances hinder innovation.

He emphasized the need for clarity in policies regarding permissible actions and standards for safety and soundness. Hill, who previously worked as a Republican Senate staffer, pointed out the challenges in policy-making due to the rapid evolution of technology.

In 2022, top U.S. bank regulators, including the FDIC, Federal Reserve, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, warned banks about the risks of engaging with cryptocurrencies, highlighting concerns over volatility. The agencies stressed the importance of preventing uncontrollable risks from affecting the banking system.

Hill criticized the FDIC’s apparent reluctance to collaborate with industry entities interested in exploring blockchain or distributed ledger technologies for purposes beyond cryptocurrency, such as tokenized deposits.

“The confidential nature of the existing process means there is little public information on what types of activities the FDIC might be open to, if any,” Hill said.

He called for more precise distinctions between crypto and tokenization, the latter referring to digital representations of physical assets often utilizing blockchain technology.

Additionally, Hill commented on the SEC’s guidance requiring firms to treat crypto assets as liabilities on balance sheets, diverging from traditional custodian accounting practices.

The vice chairman argued that this guidance, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, hampers banks’ ability to expand digital asset services for customers by increasing costs. Since its publication in 2022, this has sparked criticism from the banking sector."

The public nature of Bitcoin’s network allows for visibility into the number of tokens each wallet holds. However, the anonymity of these addresses makes it challenging to identify whether individuals or organizations own them.

This year, the original digital currency has climbed by about 70%, driven by enthusiasm for the newly approved Bitcoin ETFs that began trading in January. Despite this impressive growth, the rate of millionaire wallet creation is not as high as in the 2021 bull market, which saw over 4,000 wallets daily reach the million-dollar threshold. According to crypto analytics firm Kaiko Research, the peak for this year occurred on March 1, with 1,691 wallets.

Several factors could be contributing to this more moderate pace of wealth creation. The market may still be waiting for significant new investments as large investors, or whales, may be cashing in their profits at BTC’s new highs. Large investors are opting to secure their assets with custodial services rather than in personal wallets, according to Kaiko’s Monday report.

As the most prominent cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $72,600 today, every investor who has ever entered and remained in the Bitcoin market is enjoying profits. This latest rally also means that BTC’s value has increased almost every year since its inception, except for 2015, 2019, 2022, and 2023.

According to a person familiar with the deal, Kickstarter board members approached venture capitalist Chris Dixon in the summer of 2021 about a new investment in Kickstarter, with the proposed blockchain pivot offered as an incentive for the deal. For Dixon, the prospect of bringing a familiar name like Kickstarter into the web3 realm was too tempting to pass up.

The grand but unlikely plan would move the entire platform to a blockchain called Celo, another a16z portfolio company, where it would operate as an open-source protocol rather than relying on the proprietary code model used by most tech firms.

However, no part of the platform was converted to run on the blockchain. Following public outcry, Kickstarter formed a community advisory board, and the company ultimately decided to shift its focus away from blockchain.

Last week, crypto.news reported that a16z is in the final stages of raising $6.9 billion to enter the AI space. The company plans to complete the collection in April 2024, and half of the funds will go to the central fund. The venture firm does not disclose details on this part of the assets."

Bitcoin price continues its blistering 2024 performance, soaring above the $72,000 milestone on around 12:00 GMT on March 11, adding over $100 billion to its market cap within the last 72 hours.

As Bitcoin price reached a new all time-high of $72,286.9, its market cap soared to $1.4 trillion for the first time ever, bringing its 2024 year-to-date performance to 73%.

Speculative traders mounting bullish bets and strategic spot traders looking for front-run Bitcoin ETFs trade openings appear to be the major catalysts behind the latest bullish wave.

With the new all-time-high, investments of large institutional players like MicroStrategy and BlackRock appear to be paying off.

MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm, has expanded its digital asset portfolio to include 193,000 BTC, valued at approximately $13.896 billion. Over the weekend, the firm purchased an additional 12,000 BTC, bringing its total holding to 205,000 ($14.7 billon)

That move underscores the company’s view of Bitcoin as a viable store of value and investment asset.

Meanwhile, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has entered the Bitcoin space through its Bitcoin ETF, presently holding 197,943 BTC.

Both investments highlight Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance among institutional investors and represents a significant step for regulated diversified assets in cryptocurrency among top funds in the US."

CEO and co-founder Edul Patel highlighted the significance of this move, in an exclusive statement, particularly for institutional clients, stating, “this is much more valuable to institutions, as this was already available to retailers.”

The platform will introduce four spot ETFs in its initial phase, featuring offerings from BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Vanguard. Operating with a subsidiary registered with the Intelligence Unit of India, Mudrex has established a presence within the European Union as well, holding licenses in both Lithuania and Italy. The company aims to facilitate transactions through U.S. broker partners, while its Indian subsidiary will provide the spot bitcoin ETF service.

Despite retail clients having access to spot bitcoin ETFs via U.S. stock investing companies, Mudrex claims to be the first in India to extend such services to institutions, marking a significant milestone for the firm.

Patel explained the legal groundwork allowing Indians to invest in these ETFs under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), enabling them to diversify their portfolios through Bitcoin. The LRS allows for annual overseas investments up to $250,000, with Mudrex setting investment thresholds between $5,000 and $250,000.

Furthermore, Patel noted the importance of strong banking relationships in the U.S. for facilitating seamless transactions under the LRS. Around 20 out of 350 institutions collaborating with Mudrex have started the process of joining, anticipating investment volumes with an average ticket size of $110,000.

This development occurs amidst a complex regulatory environment in India, where the central bank and the government have shown differing stances on cryptocurrency. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has expressed resistance towards crypto, citing risks to the national economy, while the Finance Ministry has taken steps to incorporate crypto service providers within the regulatory framework, emphasizing investor and economic protection.

Amid this regulatory dichotomy, the Indian government has intensified its crackdown on illicit activities within the crypto space. The latest came from the Enforcement Directorate, as it filed a charge sheet against 299 entities, signaling the government’s firm stance against the misuse of digital currencies. These entities, notably including individuals of Chinese origin implicated in a cryptocurrency scam, have been targeted under the stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

On the other hand, in contrast to the stringent regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrency transactions, the RBI is making strides in embracing digital innovation through the development of the central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital rupee. Governor Shaktikanta Das’s announcement of plans to explore offline functionalities for the digital rupee marks a significant step towards enhancing financial inclusion and accessibility. This initiative aims to extend the benefits of digital currency to areas with limited or no internet connectivity, broadening the scope of digital financial services across the nation."

Blockchain analytics firms PeckShield and SlowMist played crucial roles in identifying and assessing the breach on March 9.

PeckShield first detected an “approve issue” on March 9, leading to the discovery that over $2 million had been siphoned from the platform. SlowMist’s investigation confirmed the total losses amounted to around $2.1 million, noting that the stolen funds were converted from Tether (USDT) to the stablecoin Dai (DAI).

The hacker exploited an external call vulnerability within the Ethereum-based contract, converting the stolen USDT to DAI. The funds remain stationary, with users urged to revoke any approvals associated with the hacker’s address to prevent additional losses.

In response to the theft, Unizen proactively reached out to the hacker with an on-chain message on March 10, offering a 20% bounty for the return of the remaining stolen assets. The company has also engaged with law enforcement and forensic experts to trace the hacker’s identity.

Despite the ongoing negotiations for the bounty, Unizen announced on March 11 its plan to begin compensating 99% of the victims immediately, prioritizing a meticulous, individualized approach to the reimbursement process.

Sean Noga, the founder and CEO of Unizen, has provided personal funds to facilitate the reimbursements, ensuring that users who suffered losses below the $750,000 threshold receive their funds back in USDT or USD Coin (USDC). Cases involving losses exceeding $750,000 are to be addressed individually. Furthermore, Unizen has released a video guide to assist users in revoking platform approvals to mitigate further risks.

Martin Granström, Unizen’s Chief Technology Officer, disclosed on social media platform X that sufficient evidence has been gathered for a comprehensive incident report, which will be published in collaboration with external third-party firms. Granström also reiterated the company’s commitment to enhancing its security measures to prevent future incidents.

This incident underscores the urgent need for the DeFi sector to continually reassess and enhance their security measures to protect user assets from complex online attacks. In a recent event last month, Seneca Protocol experienced a severe security compromise, leading to a sharp 65% decline in the price of its SEN token. CertiK reported that the assailant took advantage of a flaw within the protocol, making off with digital assets valued at around $3 million. Furthermore, the offender moved 1,000 ETH between two independent accounts, bringing the total estimated damages to about $6.4 million."

Investment frauds constituted 16% of the reported cases, followed by phishing scams at 9%. Noteworthy, TRM Labs added that phishing scams predominantly occur on the Ethereum blockchain, accounting for over 90% of such incidents.

Another prevalent form of fraud leveraging crypto is romance fraud, commonly known as “pig butchering” scams, which rely on psychological manipulation to promise victims substantial returns on their investments.

As per TRM Labs data, once dirty funds are in motion, they are twice as likely to pass through unlicensed service providers compared to licensed ones. Analysts at the San Francisco-headquartered firm also noted that despite the prevalence of crypto scams, regulatory actions and public awareness efforts appear to be yielding positive outcomes, as indicated by a 16% reduction in global crypto-related fraud from 2022 to 2023.

Similarly, the British financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, reported a significant slowdown in the growth rate of investment fraud in fiat and crypto in 2023, with the number of victims increasing by only 4.3%, down from 28% in 2022."

The London Stock Exchange (LSE) revealed in a press release on on Mar. 11 that it will start accepting applications for the admission of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in Q2, 2024. Although the exact launch date remains unclear as the LSE plans to disclose it “in due course,” the exchange noted that it plans to accept applications in accordance with the details contained in the crypto ETN factsheet.

According to the factsheet, crypto ETNs will be allowed for trading on the LSE only for professional investors and are under designated trading segments. Issuers could offer up to three different currency lines for each crypto ETN, the factsheet reads.

The document also states that the custody of underlying crypto for ETNs must primarily be in cold storage. While the LSE does not elaborate on this matter further, it added that custodians must adhere to anti-money laundering regulations in jurisdictions such as the U.K., E.U., Jersey, Switzerland, or the U.S. After the news broke, Bitcoin’s price quickly jumped above $71,000, while ETH soared above $4,000. However, it’s not clear whether LSE’s move had an effect on price appreciation.

For the London Stock Exchange, the latest move toward embracing web3 is not entirely novel, as the stock exchange has been exploring blockchain technology’s potential applications, including the possibility of facilitating blockchain-based trading for traditional financial assets for some time now. For instance, in September 2023, the London Stock Exchange Group unveiled plans to introduce blockchain-based trading for traditional financial assets, citing a strategic pivot driven by the potential benefits of integrating blockchain within traditional markets."
