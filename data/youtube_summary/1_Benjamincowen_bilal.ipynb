      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin but more specifically we're going to talk about Bitcoin dominance if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel get the video a thumbs up and also check out intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom we've been on a pretty long journey here with the Bitcoin dominance metric it is something we have discussed for quite a long period of time um not even just through the current uptrend but this is something that I've discussed on my channel going back all the way to 2019 when I was actually bearish on on bitcoin dominance but over the last couple of years two and a half years or so I have been a fairly vocal Bitcoin dominance bull for reasons based around monetary policy so my arguments have just been simply that as rates go higher for longer and as quantitative tightening continues then the ultimate outcome is that the altcoin market bleeds to bitcoin it is not nor has it ever been a personal attack on any altcoin in particular it is more so just an acknowledgment of this is what we saw happen last cycle this is what we have seen happen in other business Cycles with other asset classes namely higher risk assets bleed to lower risk assets that doesn't mean the process is monotonic it does not go up in a linear fashion it is very much a stochastic process and and sort of the the the pendulum will will swing from one one side to the other but the general direction for dominance for quite a long period of time has in fact been up and since my last video on bitcoin dominance where at least the title was Bitcoin dominance we have put in a new cycle high right and that's an important Milestone to acknowledge because Bitcoin dominance has now hit 57% now the reason why that's important is because a lot of people in the cryptoverse were very convinced that the dominance of Bitcoin had already topped going into the spot ETF a lot of people were convinced that it had topped back over here in the summer of 2023 but what you'll notice is that it just continues to go higher and higher and higher and the reason why I think a lot of people got this wrong was because they were sort of basing their Bitcoin dominance view on what happened last cycle where dominance topped out in the preh having year right it topped out in September of 2019 which is why so many have come to the conclusion that that was the top there and then when it wasn't the top well then that was the top right it was because that is what would have expected to happen based on the last Market cycle but my argument has been that the timing of the Bitcoin dominance top is not just based on where you are in a typical four-year cycle right it's more so based on monetary policy and what is the Federal Reserve doing the dominance of Bitcoin did not top in September of 2019 just because it happened to be Q3 of the prehab year and you know people thinking that that has to be repeated every Q3 of the prehab year it topped more than likely there's again there's no even definitive evidence that this is true in it of itself right it's just a theory it topped after the FED started to cut rates that is when it topped not before the FED started to cut it's topped after the Federal Reserve started to cut rates and so because of that because of that I have just simply suggested that it might take until rate Cuts before we see the Bitcoin dominance top out just based on what we saw last cycle right and admittedly I might not be right about that but also I think it would be fair to say especially for you know the people that have been the most critical of My Views that it wasn't necessarily wrong to think that considering that at least at this point Bitcoin dominance just keeps on putting in new highs and now we have seen it go all the way up to 57% right you can see here this Wick right there it all the way up to 57% so really the 60% Target that I've been talking about for the last 2 and a half years while once it seemed almost unobtainable at this point it's not really that much further away now again there's no guarantee that we reach it but of course in this video I will explain why I do think it will continue to go up not necessarily in a monotonic fashion but but the stochastic process should continue where it generally resolves to the upside it was not necessarily just the FED reducing interest rates in the last cycle that caused the Bitcoin dominance to top out it might also have had to do somewhat with the fact that they started to expand their balance sheet in September of 2019 in fact if you were to draw a line through the process from where they went from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing you will notice that basically marked the top for Bitcoin dominance so my view is just simply that as we continue into quantitative tightening and high interest rates then Bitcoin dominance should continue to go up just as we're seeing it do again that doesn't mean that every week it has to go up it doesn't mean that you won't get multi-week sometimes even multi-on pullbacks in Bitcoin dominance but the general resolution of it should continue to be to the upside the further we go one question I often get asked is why talk about Bitcoin dominance so much and my answer is always the same when you go to make an investment you have to figure out well you should figure out is it worth the risk is it worth the risk and my argument has been that Bitcoin is the least risky asset in the cryptoverse and the market cap of Bitcoin dominance or yeah not the market cap and the mar the the the actual metric of Bitcoin dominance should go up right so not only is it the least risky asset but it should outperform a majority of the different cryptocurrencies right that's not to say none of the cryptocurrencies will outperform Bitcoin I have always admitted that there would be some that outperform Bitcoin and there have been some that outperformed Bitcoin but collectively we have seen the altcoin market lead back to bitcoin over the last several years and so if you go to make an investment in the cryptoverse and you want to figure out what your risk adjusted returns are you first look at Bitcoin you look at an altcoin if you can come up with a compelling reason why that altcoin should bleed to bitcoin then it would make more Sunny it would make more sense just to you know to buy Bitcoin instead of that altcoin if you come to the conclusion that the altcoin will outperform Bitcoin then it helps justify some of that risk right but the reality is that most altcoins have now continued to put in new lows against Bitcoin even this late in the market cycle so that is something that you know it wasn't necessarily going to be true based on what people thought about sort of Cycle Theory but monetary policy certainly suggested that the dominance of Bitcoin would continue to go up now I do want to talk a little bit about where we currently are because first of all I will you know just acknowledge that we've put in a new high right so you know the haters can say whatever they want to about it but it wasn't wrong it wasn't wrong to be bullish on on bitcoin dominance whatever they may want to say right this is a new high in fact if you look at monthly hiashi candles for dominance it's just been in a macro uptrend since December of 2022 right there hasn't even been a single month where these highin AI candles turned red not yet anyways so it was never wrong to be to be bullish on it I think there were some people that it didn't really sit well with them because of it the the implication of what it meant for maybe some of the altcoins they held sort of the devaluation of that altcoin but as I said before it's not personal it's just a lesson I learned in the last Market cycle and I was hoping to relay to other people as I've said I'm not going to talk about this stuff next cycle but I do hope that we can kind of you know tie a bow on this Theory relatively soon and guys I I will say you know one more disclaimer just because I've been right about it doesn't mean I will continue to be right about it right sometimes I see people you know they have a theory and they get it right and then people think all right well they were right about it therefore what they say next has to come true that's not even necessarily true okay so please also get other people's opinions and and add those opinions to you know to what you're looking at um not just mine because again you know a lot of times when something seems like it's coming true even if it eventually continues to be true it can swing back the other way for a while um because it is a market right it is a market and there's going to be people that believe different things so please be aware of that with that said Bitcoin dominance has put in a new high in fact it put in a new high this month April which is what what I said right I said going into the having we should see dominance go to a new high and we have right and we have and that has not changed and and it played out basically as as we sort of speculated it might you know I mean I know there's a lot of people thinking that it was going to top out at the spot ETF and then the that the direction would sort of gear more towards the potential spot ETF for eth but what I said back then was that well the having is going to come first so dominance should continue to Rally into the having and you can see that it put in a new high only last week now with that said it has now had a pretty substantial pullback to 55% in fact it's actually gone below 55% right i' I've watched it earlier it Wicked below 55% a few times it's gone into the 54s and I mean it certainly could go back there right there's nothing necessarily saying that it can't but I do want to explain you know again why I think it'll continue to go up and what I would be looking for to see it shift back the other way so remember first I would expect us to have to go back to looser monetary policy that doesn't necessarily mean it has to top out after rate cuts it could be you know right as rate Cuts arrive it could even be a month before rate Cuts right but the point is it should top out somewhere around that area the problem for and the problem that has been for the altcoin market is that these rate Cuts these theoretical rate Cuts just keep getting pushed further and further out right so you know the rate cuts that were once being projected to occur in March were then pushed out to May and then June and then July and now the Market's not even expecting the First Rate cut until September now I do think there's a good chance we could get a rate cut before September but that's one of the reasons why I think we've seen altcoins go to new lows on their Bitcoin Pairs and the reason why we've seen Bitcoin dominance continue to put in new highs it's because these rate cuts that people keep waiting on that a lot of the riskier assets really need to start doing well against lower risk assets they just keep getting pushed further and further out and so as the market continues to price that in all Bitcoin pairs capitulate right that doesn't mean you're not going to get days like we've had this past weekend and I actually warned about this many many times in some of the videos that I did recently and also in in a lot of tweets that I put out on on Twitter or x a lot of posts on X where I said you know if these altcoins are going to get a bounce right if you're going to see eth get a bounce it would be just after the having if it's going to happen there's no gu guarantee that it even happens and you might say well Ben you know this is a pretty big bounce guys first of all it's still right now below 0049 second of all if you look at last cycle you will notice that e Bitcoin had not one not two but three bounces off of the range low before ultimately capitulating so far we have only had two bounces one and two so is it possible that it gets one final bounce before rolling over maybe if there is a narrative to accompany that I have to imagine it would be people speculating on the potential approval of a spot ETF for eth I don't really think it's going to happen in May but I could be wrong about that I don't really have a a strong reason for why it would be approved or not I just I'm basically going on what Market probabilities are telling about its approval and they're not so optimistic right now um so if there is going to be a third and final bounce you know it would make sense for it to occur right after the having but whatever happens here I would expect it to once again resolve to a lower high what you'll notice about the third and final bounce here is that it was rejected on the weekly time frame by the bull market support ban it did get some WI above it but it still had weekly closes below right now the bull market support band for eth Bitcoin is around 0053 to 0.0054 so for me if it's going to bounce I think that's going to be your your your sort of your limited upside and I'm not even convinced that it's going to one of the reasons for that is because over here when it bounced it was not a weekly close below the range low right here we got a weekly close below the range low and you can look at another example back over here in you know in in 2016 where once we got a close below the range low we didn't get another balance after that right I mean we just basically bled until you know for for basically two more months so these are these you know there's these things that occur in the market right where you you sometimes get counter Trend rallies it doesn't mean that the overall trend has been incorrect it just means that you're not convincing everyone on the first attempt right and every time that it tests it again you convince a few more people and that's why often times what you'll see is on the fourth attempt it will break and you'll see that actually a lot right you you'll see that actually a lot in markets where you have a trend line and it'll hold it as support one time it'll hold it as support two times it'll hold it as support three times but on the fourth time that's when it finally breaks okay I don't know I want to be clear I don't know if eth is going to get a move here or not right because I mean right now it hasn't even really bounced it's still below 049 right I mean come on you know I mean 049 is the level that all all the eth Maxis told me it was never going to go below and and here we are so bouncing right back up to 0049 isn't really necessarily proof of anything but I will say if there is a bounce what you'll notice over here is that whatever that bounce occurred it occurred relatively quickly in the move right within the first week or so is when that that move topped out just after the spot ETF for Bitcoin you saw eth Bitcoin get a bounce right right after it but what happened it just bled right back down putting in lower highs so we just are about to finish up the having week so if e Bitcoin is going to bounce um this will be the time for it to do it but I'm not convinced that it has to just because we already put a close below the range low if it does bounce I have to imagine a lot of people would assume that this would be the low but my assumption based on monetary policy would be that it would be rejected here at its bull Mark sport ban just like it was back over here in May of 2019 just before before rate Cuts arrived what's funny is that this bounce here occurred at the end of April of 2019 and here we are at the end of April of 2024 which again is also theoretically a year where the FED Cuts interest rates so is that what's going to happen is it going to bounce off go back to the bullmark sport band and then go down or is this where we are where after you get some here you had two closes below the range low you get a week where e Bitcoin goes up a little but then it just keeps on bleeding right but then it just keeps on bleeding so again how do I navigate it my my portfolio has just been Bitcoin heavy for like the last two and a half years for someone like me I don't really care if these things get low or high bounces because I ultimately expect it to resolve to the downside that is my view right so far it's worked out I mean so far it has whatever people want to say I mean it has I think it will continue to resolve to the downside and this is what I would say about eth Bitcoin my base case is that it Bottoms in June okay that's my base case that's flexible though right I'm not like I'm not that set in stone on that I think it could bottom in June if it doesn't bounce here okay so if this just ends up being like a little you know a little back test of the support level that held for so long and then we just keep on going down then I think you get about you know seven more weeks and then once you're out in in in about mid June or so I could see it theoretically bottoming and then that would mean the FED would then cut potentially in July last cycle eth Bitcoin um bottomed out in August well I guess it bottomed out after the FED started to cut rates last cycle so I mean um this in fact in July is when it broke support and that was just before the FED started to cut rates so I don't know if the fed's going to cut rate I mean I don't think they're going to cut rates in May but I will say if it doesn't bounce then I would expect eth Bitcoin to bottom out in about two months if it does bounce then it might take three to four months to go to that .3 to 04 range so that's kind of my view so if no bounce potentially of botom in June maybe July if it does bounce then it could be you know July or August or something like that so just something to think about as we as we continue to navigate the cryptoverse here and and and these these moves that have occurred and you know I I do really vividly remember the bounce here off of the range Low by eth Bitcoin and everyone's saying you know that was the low um and then it just kept on You Know It ultimately resolved to the downside so again if it does bounce I would expect it to be rejected by the bullmark scoreband if it doesn't then you might just go into final capitulation into the the early summer and I think it would be honestly fantastic for it to not bounce and to just get about a TW Monon bleed to bottom out the same time it did in 202 too because if you look at this what you'll notice is that historically after eth Bitcoin breaks the range low it takes about 8 weeks for it to bottom when you see that it break the it broke the range low right here the first weekly close below the range low it took eight weeks to bottom we saw this first weekly close below the range low last week and we of course only have gone one week since then 8 weeks would actually put you in in June the reason why that interesting is because there's some type of seasonality that comes with eth in the summer that for whatever reason ethereum is allergic to the summer months right it doesn't like it does not like summertime I think one of the reasons for that is because during the summertime people go outside and touch grass maybe you should try it sometime and I think that in the summer time people focus Less on risky assets and they focus more on other things therefore higher risk assets like e will bleed to lower risk assets like Bitcoin just because there's not really you know you really need a reason for Bitcoin dominance you don't really need a reason for Bitcoin dominance to go up I mean that's just kind of what it does uh you need a reason for it to go down and and in in my opinion the way that it can continue to go down um is or the way that that that that that Bitcoin dominance can continue to go up and E Bitcoin could continue to go down is just simply people tuning out this summer and not watching crypto and when people don't watch it that's kind of when all Bitcoin pairs can bottom when\n",

      "Bitcoin dominance you don't really need a reason for Bitcoin dominance to go up I mean that's just kind of what it does uh you need a reason for it to go down and and in in my opinion the way that it can continue to go down um is or the way that that that that that Bitcoin dominance can continue to go up and E Bitcoin could continue to go down is just simply people tuning out this summer and not watching crypto and when people don't watch it that's kind of when all Bitcoin pairs can bottom when people just don't really care anymore about about crypto so I think it would actually be great if there's no bounce and it just bleeds until June and it bottoms out around the same time as it did in 2022 because you can see in 2022 it bottomed out in June right it bottomed out in June if you're kind of like what's been talking about with this weakness by eth in the summer you know don't take my word for it honestly don't this is crypto after all don't trust verify you know don't just let me blow smoke and then you take it to the bank like it means something right let's go take a look let's go look at the um at the uh the monthly average Roi okay so this we're looking to look at the 90day Roi averaged out over the course of you know of of all of all of eth's history so if we do that if we pull it up for eth what you're going to see is that if you buy on average if you buy eth in January February or March then on average throughout all Market Cycles all years eth is up about 2x 90 days later but if you buy it in April you can see it's only 1.5 buying it in may only 1.2 buying it in June basically break even now clearly there are some times where the market goes down this is averaging out data going back pretty far to 2015 you know if you change this to 2018 you can see that it's not you know it isn't the numbers aren't as big right but it still gets into this lull here in the summer months right and if you take it out 2020 you can see that you know it goes down into April still kind of low in May but it doesn't really pick back up until the end of the year and you can see that for a lot of different time frames right I mean a lot of different time frames it's the beginning of the year and the end of the year that have the best Roi for eth the beginning and the end with a l kind of in between right and we're just looking at CH different calculation starts high in the the high in the beginning high in the end sort of a low in between and so when you think about e there there e some type of weakness that often comes in the summer months by by eth Bitcoin and we can actually see that if you go look at asset pairs eth Bitcoin look at the 90day ROI of eth Bitcoin on average going back through 2015 and you can see that you know the best time honestly to get into it is September you know trading your Bitcoin to eth in September has often been a pretty good time in terms of a 90-day Roi and isn't it funny how last cycle eth Bitcoin bottomed in September right what if it I mean imagine if it takes until September I mean I hope not but in the grand sche of things it's only 5 months from now you know I mean this this thing has been going on for 2 and a half years 5 months is really nothing at this point I don't really think it's going to take until September to be completely honest but there are other reasons why that have me thinking that it might take that long and I I'll show you a couple of those reasons as well um but I'm I'm hoping that it just sort of bottoms out in June if it if it gets a bounce here into into May then certainly August September time frame could be on the cards I mean it really just depends on on on when the FED shifts over to looser monetary policy right I mean I think there's a lot of people thinking that there has to be a certain answer to this question but in reality it's based on something that none of us know the answer to right so I mean it's going to be based on on things that we just simply cannot know and so while everyone wants to pretend like they have an edge and can predict exactly when it's going to bottom and some people are predicting now no one knows because no one really knows exactly what the fed's going to do um I think that they might pivot sooner than the market is thinking especially if the market continues to be weak because you know some parts of the market like the NASDAQ are starting to show some weakness but given that there is often some type of seasonal weakness kind of going into May in election years so so far this is really nothing different than normal um but if it were to continue and if if it were to evolve into something more then it would be time to to think that okay maybe they'll pivot sooner than what the market currently thinks so the reason why I just spent so much time talking about e Bitcoin is because if Bitcoin dominance is going to go to 60% I would have to imagine it's going to be on the back of eth Bitcoin dropping some more right it's hard to imagine a scenario where eth Bitcoin goes up and Bitcoin dominance um continues to go a lot higher now one thing that I I feel compelled to present to you which would potentially try to poke some holes in my theory if you look at the year-to DAT Roi of Bitcoin dominance without stable coins and you compare it to Prior having years you can see that in 2016 when the having was you know further out in the summer there was a spike by Bitcoin dominance and you can see in 2020 when the having was in May there was a spike in Bitcoin dominance right and you can see here it was in April there was a spike in Bitcoin dominance now what's interesting is that every cycle Bitcoin dominance while in 2016 it had a really big dip going into that year right 2020 the dip wasn't as big right this time the dip was basically nothing I mean it barely even went below the yearly open right so what you'll notice is that after the in in the third quarter of the year right in the third quarter of the year um so what I'm thinking is that if eth Bitcoin just capitulates over the next month or two then you could still see something like that happened where Bitcoin dominance tops out and then it it kind of comes into a lull or something over here into into Q3 um but obviously a lot of people people are going to look at this and say well you know what happens if the having is the top for dominance because you can see that there were some local highs by dominance um in those having years but one thing to point out is that even though there were highs by dominance at the prior having years did eventually go higher than where they were at the having right so in 2020 you can see that it was here by the end of the year Bitcoin dominance went higher in 2016 you can see that it was you know right around here by the end of the year Bitcoin dominance went higher so I would still be under the assumption that even if there is a pullback by the end of the year dominance you know should be a lot higher um and also considering too that these pullbacks while a lot of people expected a larger pullback by dominance going into the having year because of what we've seen historically look at this there wasn't really much of a pullback at all so maybe these pullbacks is not much of a pullback at all either If the Fed refuses to Pivot and that's why I think dominance has continued to stay a lot stronger than a lot of people thought that it would um so I would continue to look at this chart uh because I think it's going going to be really interesting to follow and if you look at other things like eth Bitcoin in having years I imagine that might tell a fairly interesting story so if you look at 2024 you can see that eth Bitcoin has already fallen about 10% in 2020 you can see that eth Bitcoin by this point in the cycle was up 40% right so there's clearly a difference clearly there's a difference here you know in 2020 it was already putting in higher highs or sorry higher lows higher lows here eth Bitcoin is still putting in lower lows which again to me suggests that the reason it's not playing out like that having year is just simply because of where monetary policy currently is that's the reason otherwise it probably would play out like the prior one but inflation is making the FED keep rates higher for longer it's nothing personal to e you know I mean I I like ethereum I really do I'm not a Bitcoin Maxi I just I've made my case for why dominance is going to go higher and you know I've certainly lost a lot of sleep over it over the years but I'd like to tell my former self you know from two years ago that you know had all the people telling me I was wrong I I wish I could just tell them you know in the having dominance is going to hit 57% ignore them right ignore them you were not wrong to be bullish on it so then the question becomes now will there be a final push to 60% one reason why 60% is a target of mine but it's honestly not the reason I initially came up with but one reason is because last cycle if you look at the Fibonacci retrace tool dominance retraced to the 618 this cycle you can see that the 618 corresponds to 60% right it corresponds to 60% so that's the reason why I think ultimately that we will get to that level um you can see that once we cross the0 five in 2019 we ultimately hit 60 or we hit the 618 um only about two months later right so if that were to repeat it would mean we hit the 618 in June which is exactly when I said maybe eth Bitcoin bottoms out right if it doesn't get a bounce now if you Deion Go full Dej on me again and bid it up once again then maybe you make me wait later in the year right which hey you're going to do what you're going to do um I'm not going to try to worry about what people think if that happens but but um that's just something to look at right here and and note that it did ultimately make it to the 618 right it it it actually you know did make it there um it took a long time to get there but it made it there you can see that it also swept the 618 again at the end of the having year right on bitcoin's parabolic rally now there's an interesting Trend here that you may not be aware of but it is actually quite fascinating when you kind of hone in on it and and look at it very very closely because Bitcoin dominance has this thing that it does where it puts in lower highs for a while making people think that it's just going to go down and then when people least expect it it just blasts through right it that's what it does you know and and that's why there's so much hate for being bullish on bitcoin dominance because it often will do things like that where it it it it it sort of luls people into to a false sense of security to make them think that their altcoin is durably outperforming Bitcoin when in reality Bitcoin is slowly sucking the liquidity out and then when no one's paying attention anymore when the social risk is basically zero it takes off again and you can can see that it did it here right it also did it over here when we were in a parabolic rally during low interest rates and quantitative easing but that's what it does right it it it it breaks out when people least expect it and then it just goes on these manic rallies now what you will notice is not to look at the lower Highs but simply look at the highs and draw a trend line what do you notice here put in a high sweep the high go back down to the bull market support band hold it as support and then blast on through right now look what happened the next time that happened put in a high sweep the high go back to the bullmark SP ban and whoops all season right that's the All Season you guys want that you guys keep telling me for the last two and a half years I was missing out on but I don't see it on the chart I mean again my eyes are bad my you know my vision is not that great I have contacts but this is not all season you know and this is what I've learned in Prior Cycles is that all season only occur for about 6 to 12 months and then we all spend the next 3 years dreaming of it and by the last time the person by the last person that capitulates their alts to bitcoin that's finally when alt season begins once everyone's convinced that Bitcoin is the way now I do think Bitcoin is the way to be successful in the crypto but even though that's true I respect the the shifts in Trends and while Bitcoin dominance honestly spends about three years of the market cycle going up with people and complete disbelief the entire way it only spends about one year of the market cycle going down and then we dream about that for the next three years so rather than dream about that for three years just enjoy the dominance rally Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio wait till lose to monetary policy and then altcoins start to durably outperform bitcoin but what do you notice in both cases Bitcoin dominance swept the high in both cases and in one case we went back to the bull market support band held it as support and in the other case we went back to it and we didn't hold it as support when we didn't hold it as support alt season happened when we did hold it as support the altcoin Reckoning continued now what's going on today well you'll see here that we put in a high in December we then swept that high more or less right here in March now technically speaking where we went in March was not a higher high so I don't know if you can call it even sweeping the high or not if you exclude stable coins it most certainly was is not sweeping the high but we're going to look at it both ways if you assume that the March move here by dominance was the sweep of the high similar to this one then what you'll notice just after it is it came back down to the bull market support band held it as support and is now breaking out again if that is the case then that means we are here and that means the dominance is going to turn around really quickly and start to go back up because it's had a pretty big pullback right it's dropped from 57% to 55% so if we are there then it means we're already on the third attempt and this could be the move that is about to happen over the next two months that takes Bitcoin dominance to 60% that is what I would hope because I kind of want to be done with with these discussions if I'm being honest I don't like being the bad guy you know I don't but that I think is where we could potentially be now with that said there is some evidence to suggest that the March move was not a sweep of the high and that would be to look at the Bitcoin dominance excluding stable coins now if you look at it excluding stable coins what you'll notice is that we put in a high in October and then we came back up to that high in December but it was not a higher high it was not truly a sweep of the high this is truly a sweep of the high is it not right no doubt about it excluding stable coins Bitcoin dominance put on a new high I cannot tell you guys how many people have been telling me about ex you know dominance excluding stable coins about how it was going down and I kept telling them I'm like no it's probably going to do exactly what it did last cycle so on the ITC website we have the way to to track it excluding stables and look at this here you can see the same thing happened right lower highs and then at one point it finally swept the high and then it had a one month pullback and then it and then it continued its Journey you see that lower highs lower highs lower highs sweep the high just as everyone thinks that Bitcoin dominance is already topped think about how many people told you dominance had already topped in January right sweep the high and then it came back down for one month and then it went on and then it went on its way to put into the top so if you look at that same pattern today you can see something similar right lower high lower high lower high lower high sweep the high we're now in that pullback right so this pullback right here is potentially the one that we are currently in but this is a more volatile version of this right the range on this just to give you an idea right it went from 57 all the way down to 50 so about a 7% difference this one here has been about 58.6 down to 53.8 right it's only about a 5% difference so this one over here was more volatile than this one was this pullback pulled back to the third top right so you had this first top second top the third top which was higher than the second top it pulled back to that level if you look at where we currently are this is the first second third the third top is right around where the dominance currently is excluding stable right so what if we're just in this pullback right here now if we are in that pullback it it still means that it could take a little bit longer for the dominance train to continue but if that's the case I still think it's only going to be a few weeks one of the things that could cause you know if again if if people are going to speculate about a spot e ETF and it gives eth some legs for a little while I I think it's only going to last cple a few weeks honestly because I I think there's a good chance it just gets rejected in May and maybe that's when eth Bitcoin finally takes the plunge 003 to 04 but you can clearly see this same Trend occurred now what do you also notice the same Trend here on dominance excluding Stables also occurred up here right high and lower highs and then eventually we swept the high right I mean it's the same exact thing thing but the difference when we swept the high here we just capitulated back down to the lows in alt season so I think we are more over here than we are here the reason I think that as I stated earlier is because when you look at dominance of Bitcoin I think it's based and works around monetary policy and we know that last cycle dominance did not top until the FED pivoted until we went from high rates to lower rates and from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing that's when it topped last cycle precisely in fact precisely so because of that because this has not changed and I don't think it's about to change I think it's going to be sometime later maybe later this year but it hasn't changed yet because of that I think that the the dominance of Bitcoin will hold support above its bull market support band now the bull market support band right now is actually kind of low it's all the way down at around a little above 53% so I mean I don't think it has to go that low honestly as I showed excluding Stables it might just hold here but if if the Deens just can't help themselves and E Bitcoin bounces one last time to the bull market sport band it is possible for dominance to fall back in to its 20we SMA one final time before going on into the final move to 60% my base case is that we don't need that that's my base case is that we don't need to see that happen I don't think we need to go back down there and the reason why I'll say that is because what a lot of times I'll see happen for for people that are very convinced of a trend is that they'll miss out on the trend because they're constantly trying to trade counter Trend r rallies right they'll constantly try to trade it so you know they'll be bullish on something or bearish on something but because they're constantly second guessing themselves they'll try to catch every single move right so that means converting their Bitcoin to alt every single time you get these moves and if you do that you miss out on the larger move up so for me my base case is not to try to predict every counter Trend rally because I don't do that every time we do get a counter Trend rally I get a lot of hate that I have to deal with because the trolls come out and they're like oh how's Bitcoin dominance doing today but I'm not in the business of trying to predict these counter Trend rallies I just want to know is it going to continue going higher or not over a more medium time frame you know like a couple of months time frame and if I think it\n",

      "for me my base case is not to try to predict every counter Trend rally because I don't do that every time we do get a counter Trend rally I get a lot of hate that I have to deal with because the trolls come out and they're like oh how's Bitcoin dominance doing today but I'm not in the business of trying to predict these counter Trend rallies I just want to know is it going to continue going higher or not over a more medium time frame you know like a couple of months time frame and if I think it is I don't really care about what it does in the short term I don't right I really don't so that I think is where we are right that I think is where we are looking at dominance excluding stable coins I think we're going to get one final push to the 618 at 60% at 60% now if you look at all Bitcoin pairs you will notice that last cycle they bottomed when the fed pivoted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing precisely at that at that point now we've seen a little bit of a bounce by all Bitcoin pairs I'm sure there are some comments on YouTube and on Twitter asking me about about this because again they haven't broken down yet and that's something that I'm I mean yes they haven't you're right they haven't broken down yet but that doesn't mean that they won't in fact last cycle just before the breakdown they did get one final push to near the bull market support ban they didn't even quite make it there and then they capitulate it the bull market support ban right now for all Bitcoin pairs is at 045 to 046 and we're already at 043 and we were earlier today we were at 044 and remember last cycle we didn't even make it there so what if that's where all Bitcoin pairs are the final bounce before the capitulation all Bitcoin pairs over the Long Haul are oscillators at best on an individual scale all Bitcoin pairs collectively bleed over the macro scale that's how pessimistic with pessimistic person we look at it they bleed and I'll show you why parallel Channel connect the dots those are lower highs don't take it up with me that's just what the chart shows right I don't control it if you have a problem with it do something about your altcoin it's bleeding to bitcoin right over the macro scale we have seen all Bitcoin pairs put in lower highs and lower lows glass half empty approach okay glass half full approach all Bitcoin pairs are oscillators that top out at approximately parity with Bitcoin where the alt Bitcoin pairs are equal where the altcoin market cap is equal to the Bitcoin market cap and around 0.99 or one right and they bought them out at 1/4 the market cap of Bitcoin 0.25 and that this move to 1.35 and this move to to 0.18 are just deviations that we shouldn't put a lot of weight in so for me if all Bitcoin pairs come back to 0.25 that's good enough for me I I don't if if it's in a macro downtrend and it's lower highs and lower lows then so be it you know maybe they bleed a little bit longer but guess what I will have preserved the Satoshi valuation of my portfolio for three years by being Bitcoin heavy as opposed to being altcoin heavy so this is the final move that I think needs to occur the 42% drop by Bitcoin pairs to the range lows which I think will happen going into the summer months that is my base case that doesn't mean you can't bounce around a little bit first but that is my base case 0.25 that's where I think we're going dominance excluding Stables you see this wedge that we just we just broke well we just broke through the the Range High here but do you see this wedge that we're in the top of the range is 64% if you assume we're at 59% now we're just below 59% excluding Stables that's a 5% move 5% right from 59 to 64 a commencer move by Bitcoin dominance including Stables 5% 55 to 60 55% to 60% a lot of these altcoins are already capitulating right Ada a Bitcoin has finally taken out the lows you know again it's not personal you know and I said for a long time that I did not think this trend line would hold I said it for a long time because you don't assume that an altcoin gains value on bitcoin from one cycle to another on average some of them will for two Market Cycles but there's not usually one that does it for three not usually there might be a few exceptions to the rule you assume base case for like 99.9% of alt coins that they are oscillators at best at best which means that a to bitcoin still theoretically needs to go to the range lows right and you can see that at the highs it's lower highs again it's not personal it's just this is what it does now do you remember earlier when I said that I don't think it's going to take until September for Bitcoin dominance to hit 60% or to top out but it is possible I want to show you one reason why again it's not my base case um and there could be a case where Bitcoin dominance goes to 60% this summer and then I flip my view on it and then it just keeps on going up you know that's possible too um but look at adaa Bitcoin do you see this trend line here point A to point B and you see where Ada to bitcoin finally bottomed all the way down here now look at this cycle same thing you see that trend line very similar trend line exhibit a very similar levels too slightly lower but it makes sense that it's slightly lower because alt coins are oscillators at best so you can see here that if you continue this trend line if Ada Bitcoin bottoms on the Final Touch of this trend line down here that doesn't happen until September right that doesn't happen until September so if that's the case then it could mean you still have a few more months of this chopping out right if it took this long to get here if it took a lot longer to get to this point maybe it takes a little bit longer to get to this point and so that is one reason it could take until September but again there does exist a scenario where it takes until September but Bitcoin dominance hit 60% before September because maybe the Bitcoin dominance tops out at 64% or 62% right maybe it goes higher than what I think or maybe it just goes to 60% in September one reason why I wouldn't put a lot of faith in a trend line like this is because there does exist a scenario where we just break the trend line to the downside and if that happens that could actually cause the capitulation that the market needs to finally find a bot one reason I wouldn't put a lot of faith in these is if you look at some other other if you look at some other altcoins you could try to draw a similar trend line right from here to here to here and you can see that eventually it just broke to the downside right that's a further period back that's all the way back in 2021 so if you just want to take it from here to here you can see that if you were to connect this dot to that one right if you were to connect that one sorry I'm trying to trying to connect these dots but let me get it let me try to get it as accurate as possible right so if you connect these dots there right you can see that you do sometimes go below that trend line right we just went below it again I don't know if Dots are Relic but what I would look for is to see if it can bottom out against Bitcoin it hasn't done that yet it doesn't mean that it won't but it hasn't done it yet it is it possible that this is the low yeah it's possible but even if it is the low you would still need to see it hold that low on at least one more attempt right so that's why you know when looking at something like Ada a Bitcoin I don't think you should necessarily put a ton of trust into such a trend line because there does exist a scenario where it goes below the trend line before September just like dot Bitcoin went below the trend line and it's been going below the trend line and it keeps on trying to hold it and you know I think people keep on thinking it's capitulated and then that's the bottom right and then it gets a pretty big bounce and then it just bleeds on back down and I think people are getting tired because they're like well why does it keep on bleeding back down you know alts didn't bleed this long last cycle or at least most of them didn't that were not relics why is it bleeding well one of two reasons option one reason one it's a relic option two we just haven't seen a shift in monetary policy so all coins haven't had the chance to bought them so again for every altcoin it's not personal like I don't I mean there's all these altcoins that could theoretically go back up and do great things in the future right they haven't had a chance to bottom out against Bitcoin most of them because we just haven't seen a shift in monetary policy so if you have an altcoin and you're like you're wondering what to do what I would say is we haven't even reached the point where they've been given the chance to bottom because monetary policy hasn't shifted Litecoin Bitcoin just put in a new low last week you know last week link Bitcoin I sort of Drew this out a while ago um we'll see I mean that you can see the low from June of 2023 see if it holds that low maybe in May maybe in May madic Bitcoin is in out right capitulation now I think madic Bitcoin might bottom out 1 month before eth Bitcoin so if you see madic form a low and then bounce off of that low the same time that eth Bitcoin puts in a new low that probably means that madic Bitcoin has bottomed I have said for a long time on ITC premium that the spot to start looking for a low on madic Bitcoin is at less than a th000 stats well guess what we just went below 1,000 stats we just went to 953 I don't know if that's the low I could see it going a bit lower we've seen a lot of times after Bitcoin pairs break they dropped 50% right and right now it's dropped 45 if you look at adaa Bitcoin last cycle when it dropped below the range low it dropped about 50% right from here here this drop a 52% drop so if madic were to drop 52% from the breakdown point it would put it at around 800 SATs so that has kind of been my base case for madic 800 SATs it's already coming pretty close right again I'm not asking you to time the market perfectly I'm just saying that it could continue to go down a little bit more if is going to play out like some of the other altcoins did last cycle now you probably heard me say that I think it'll bottom out before E I think it very well could look at adaa Bitcoin last cycle when did it bottom it did not bottom in September when eth did it bottomed in August but it also broke before eth look at this Ada Bitcoin broke support in June eth Bitcoin didn't break until July adaa Bitcoin bottomed in August e Bitcoin bottomed September now look at madic look at madic madic Bitcoin dropped below the range low weekly close I don't care about Wicks no one's getting out of bed for a wick weekly close in March e Bitcoin below the weekly close in April I think e Bitcoin might bottom out in June therefore keep an eye on madic bitcoin to maybe botom out in in in in May now again if the Deion are going to go full Deen on me again then maybe just shift that timeline out a month or two but the process is still there you know it's still there avax Bitcoin this is what I said guys you know that's what I this is exactly what I said that this is what happens you know and I drew the comparisons I drew the comparisons you know I said look Dash Bitcoin very very similar pattern in in in in uh last cycle did the same thing you know it set a low in the bull market and then Revisited that low here in December 2019 when social risk bottomed when did social risk bottom October over here social risk bottomed well the lower the the higher low right December 2019 you can see clearly avac Bitcoin got a rally been bleeding ever since ever since the year began you know Dash Bitcoin look same thing I mean look at avac Bitcoin pump up slow bleed Dash Bitcoin re see you can see ax Bitcoin St right this low here was set in the bull market retest that low here bounce off of it just like like Dash Bitcoin did come back down to the bull market support band get a bounce off of it actually it went below it then bounce avac Bitcoin go below it then bounce Dash Bitcoin bleed avax Bitcoin it's bleeding no does that mean that AAC has to follow the the path of Dash no it doesn't actually avax has the chance the opportunity to try to put in a a another bottom here there are altcoins that do that right I mean adaa Bitcoin was a great example of that last cycle where it found some lows that can happen there's no it's not set in stone but because the FED hasn't pivoted what I keep saying is is why take the risk RK of the altcoins when they're just bleeding back to bitcoin that doesn't mean they're not going to be successful it doesn't mean that they can't ultimately give you great returns over a long period of time but if you're in a period where an asset is bleeding for three years against a lower risk asset it kind of just makes sense to hold the lower risk asset right I mean look I mean guys dot Bitcoin just put on a new low last week you know and this this is the this is the thing that I dealt with back over here in October everyone's saying well I missed the low on do Bitcoin because I didn't buy it in October and now it's just at another low I mean the problem is I don't care about timing the bottom on this stuff right I just don't want to buy a falling knife you know I'd rather buy it in an uptrend after the fed's pivoted than to keep buying it as it bleeds the people that will give me the hardest time about it are the people that bought it all the way down you know I'm not saying it's going to bleed forever I'm not saying it won't I'm just saying it hasn't even had the chance to bottom because the FED hasn't pivoted yet so Bitcoin has been stronger than a lot of the other alts right if 20,000 SATs breaks the next support level is 12,000 now I've seen some people talk about Soul dominance because it's been doing pretty well here right but this also reminds me of a prior altcoin Trend not it doesn't remind me of a prior altcoin but it reminds me of a trend you'll sometimes see where the dominance of an altcoin puts in a high one cycle and then it sweeps the high a cycle later and then it just goes down what am I talking about right there's not a lot of altcoins that do that in fact I mean I imagine most altcoins don't do that where they put in a high on dominance and they put in a higher high so first of all credit where credit is due I mean congrats to salana for achieving that I'm not again I I that's just a fact I'm not going to try to take anything away from it it's just a fact that it has put in a higher high right that's an achievement does that mean it will continue indefinitely no could it push up again one more time it's possible but this isn't the first time I've seen something like this happen xrp dominance look at what it did first cycle put in a high later on on sweep the high it's been going lower ever since right so it's always easy to you know to call for these major events in in the altcoin market and to think they're going to go up against Bitcoin and and get a lot of market share these are all patterns we've seen before right in fact I I hear a lot of people talking about people I've heard a lot of people say that that soul will flip e but what's funny about that is guess when those narratives become the strongest at range highs this is the sole eth valuation they become the strongest at range highs so you have to be careful with this stuff right again salana has done very well this year if you have held it you've done very well over the last year and a half just be careful because because you know I I've seen these things happen before where you'll see dominance put on a new high for the altcoin you'll see it go back up to the Range High on its eth pair sometimes on its Bitcoin pair and it still doesn't change the longer term Trend altcoins are great for making money but rotating back into Bitcoin is the way you keep it that's the way you keep it if you hold the altcoin for too long you can watch it diminishing you can watch it diminish against its Bitcoin valuation eth Bitcoin eth Bitcoin gives great returns in a QE bull market it absolutely sucks in a qt bull market even though ethereum does really well in QE bull markets it's still been putting in lower highs since 2017 you know that's a fact now it's also been putting in higher lows right and I'll talk about that more if this plays out like I've I've talked about I mean I don't mind talking about now right these these are higher lows I'm not hiding behind it I was bullish on E Bitcoin in 2019 my first video on my channel is right there saying it's severely undervalued you know so don't come at me with this BS of well why don't you talk about the higher lows why don't you guys acknowledge that it's been in a downtrend for two and a half years and really it's been putting in lower highs since June of 2017 you know you know how everyone gives people a hard time to invest in gold because it hasn't put in or now it has put in a new high but it hadn't put on a new high for like 10 years what about the eth Bitcoin valuation it's 3 years away from not putting in a new high in a decade so I mean if we make it to 2027 and eth eth still hasn't put in a new high against Bitcoin then don't go get the gold bugs a hard time you invested in an asset that went down against a lower risk asset again I'm going to be bullish on the eth Bitcoin valuation but I still think it needs to go to 03 to 04 and then we're going to figure out what's more important the higher lows or the lower highs I honestly don't know the answer to that question I could I can make a compelling case either way honestly I could you might think you know my view but you can't know my view because I don't know my view on it I don't know what's more important the lower highs or all these higher lows right I don't know how could I know it looks like it's breaking down here to me but that doesn't mean that it's not on some type of logarithmic regression Journey you know where just like Bitcoin USD follows like a logarithmic regression Journey maybe eth Bitcoin is following one too where it just kind of falls back in to this range here oscillates around it for a while and then goes up and then we finally figure out what's more important the lower highs or the higher lows I don't know others Bitcoin the bane of my existence for all of 2024 because everyone's told me how it's only going to go up others Bitcoin in this Wick took out all of its gains since the summer of 2023 in a single week right that's what the markets do you take the stairs up convince everyone there right and then you take the elevator down other there's Bitcoin just swept lows it had not seen since July of 2023 back when this whole thing began for the altcoin market so I look at this and I know that a lot of people people have been bullish on others Bitcoin since the year began but guess what others Bitcoin basically topped out at the beginning of the year and then it went down it put in a lower high and then it dropped and now it's going back up it's going back up what's going on do you guys remember earlier when I said a lot of times it's like the fourth time that it breaks right you tag the trend line enough the fourth time it breaks you remember eth Bitcoin we talked about that eth Bitcoin here this time it theoretically broke the third time if you get if you get a uh uh another bounce in the bullmark sport ban and then break it would be the fourth time but if you look at last cycle you can see that it was the fourth time right one two three and break sometimes those trend lines occur are not horizontal trend lines but but um diagonal trend lines now diagonal trend lines are a bit hand wavy they're kind of fluffy if we're being honest I'm not going to don't take it to the bank they're not cashing it in type thing but if you look at others Bitcoin on The Daily what do you notice there's a\n",

      "The video transcript presents a bullish case for Bitcoin dominance, arguing that it will continue to rise as the Federal Reserve maintains a tight monetary policy, leading to the altcoin market bleeding to the relative safety of Bitcoin. The speaker has been bullish on Bitcoin dominance for the past 2.5 years, and notes that it has recently hit a new cycle high of 57%, contrary to the expectations of many who believed it had already topped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker attributes this to the fact that Bitcoin dominance tends to top out after the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, rather than just based on the typical 4-year market cycle. The speaker suggests that Bitcoin dominance could continue to rise towards a 60% target, as the Federal Reserve keeps pushing back the timeline for interest rate cuts, which are seen as necessary for the altcoin market to start outperforming Bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker acknowledges that this process may not be linear, and there could be pullbacks and volatility along the way. The speaker emphasizes that the decision to invest in Bitcoin versus altcoins should be based on a risk-adjusted analysis, as Bitcoin is considered the least risky asset in the cryptocurrency space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also discusses the potential for a short-term bounce in Ethereum's price relative to Bitcoin (ETH/BTC), but suggests that any such bounce would likely be rejected at the bull market support band and ultimately lead to further downside. The speaker's base case is for ETH/BTC to bottom out in June or July, potentially coinciding with the timing of the next Federal Reserve rate cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the speaker provides historical analysis on the seasonal trends in Ethereum's and Bitcoin's performance, noting that altcoins tend to underperform Bitcoin during the summer months. The speaker also examines the relationship between Bitcoin dominance and the cryptocurrency market's performance around Bitcoin halving events, suggesting that Bitcoin dominance could see a spike in the third quarter of the year, similar to what has been observed in previous halving cycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker further elaborates on the potential for altcoin capitulation, noting that many altcoins have been in a macro downtrend, exhibiting lower highs and lower lows against Bitcoin. The speaker suggests that this process may not be linear, and there could be short-term bounces and volatility along the way, but the overall trend is for altcoins to bleed against Bitcoin.\n",

      "The speaker also discusses the potential for specific altcoins, such as Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), to see further downside against Bitcoin. The speaker cautions against relying too heavily on trend lines, as they can sometimes be broken, and emphasizes the importance of a risk-adjusted approach when investing in the cryptocurrency market.\n",

      "sport ban and then break it would be the fourth time but if you look at last cycle you can see that it was the fourth time right one two three and break sometimes those trend lines occur are not horizontal trend lines but but um diagonal trend lines now diagonal trend lines are a bit hand wavy they're kind of fluffy if we're being honest I'm not going to don't take it to the bank they're not cashing it in type thing but if you look at others Bitcoin on The Daily what do you notice there's a trend line you can draw and if you look at this you can connect the dots and say huh One Tap two three break what if the move now is just a back test of the trend line to confirm that that is actually not resistance I don't know I mean if it breaks through here I would say the bullmark sport ban will will reject it but I don't even know if it's going to break through here but you can see that right you can see that one two three fourth attempt break remember last cycle it was after eth Bitcoin broke down that eth USD had a larger pullback right it was after eth Bitcoin broke down remember that right if you go if you overlay ethusd if you overlay ethusd onto the chart you'll see it right eth Bitcoin broke here and then ethusd had a correction eth Bitcoin technically already broke and you can see that ethusd is potentially in the middle of a correction but you know those trend lines we were talking about that fourth attempt if you look at ethusd kind of see something similar right on a log scale anyways trend line right sort of a fake out right there if you want to call it that right but one two three if it comes back down it might finally break and if it finally breaks then we go to the lower regression band right so I'm there's a lot of things right there's a lot of different things that you know we can look at here but you get the idea right we're seeing a lot of this play out and remember last cycle after eth Bitcoin broke it ethusd fell back through the wedge right so you can kind of see it's falling back through potentially back through the wedge here in the summer months right and now remember when it fell through the wedge last cycle e Bitcoin bottomed like one month after it fell through the wedge so if eth USD falls through the wedge in May then maybe eth Bitcoin Bottoms in June right the other thing to remember is that last cycle Bitcoin dominance kept going up even after gold broke out right so if you look at Bitcoin dominance and you overlay gold and you look at at at last cycle right you can see that that gold broke out right here and then dominance topped so this was uh gold broke out in like early June and then dominance topped so that' be July August so three months later so gold here it depends on if you want to say December but really it was it was you know potentially February um if gold broke out in February March April May maybe dominant it stops out in May or maybe you know around May or June right so a lot of it I mean a lot of it seems like it it could be lining up it's just a really it's a really slow process right it's a really slow process and um you know when you when you sort of see these moves by others Bitcoin where you spend the entire year where it's sort of grinding higher but the top was the week of December 25th right I mean that was the top so like yeah a lot of people have been bullish on others Bitcoin and they've been telling me well you keep talking about total three but you should be looking at others which is everything outside of the top 10 oh you tell me right I mean as far as I can tell the top was in back over here in December late December early January and all you guys got excited that were bullish on this got excited over a lower high because now it's put in a lower low remember what happened last cycle with others and I learned the lesson the hard way and I keep telling you guys that this is the lesson I learned the hard way and instead of people saying oh okay they give me every reason why I'm wrong but remember last cycle others others Bitcoin others divided by Bitcoin dropped 60% it rallied 60% and then it dropped 60% and it bottomed out when the FED pivoted now look at this it's the same thing others Bitcoin dropped 60% it then rallied 60% almost 70% and uh the the FED is not pivoted and now from this high it's already down 30% right it's already down 30% which is again I I called for this when it was at the highs it's not like I'm just now saying it right I mean every Bitcoin Dominus video for the last three months has been saying this very thing that others Bitcoin is probably going to drop 60% let already dropped 30 it's back up to only being down 15 or 17 or so but if it were to go down 60% that puts it all the way down here at 0.1 connect the dots connect the dots right exhibit a b and c just like over here you connect the dots one two three is where it bottomed when the fed pivoted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing so I know some of these micro caps have been doing very well but when these Wicks happen like this and those alts get rinsed on their Bitcoin pairs that's why it shows you it's important to take profits back to bitcoin occasionally so that you preserve the Satoshi valuation of your portfolio because then what ends up happening is everyone who rode this up and mocked me on bitcoin dominance then potentially finds themselves down here in a few months and then they're wondering why they didn't take any any profits on random memec coin number 475 right then they wonder why they didn't do it and it'll seem so obvious right it'll seem so obvious like why did they think that was going to outperform bitcoin as you know as higher rates continued and as quantitative tightening continued why did they think that because of the community I guess you know because of the community but the community I mean I I mean honestly doesn't really mean a damn thing in in tighter tighter monetary policy so and the communities are really all the same um anyways so yeah I mean I think Bitcoin dominance uh it is in a pullback right now admittedly um there's no doubt about it you know you're you're from 57 down to 55 in a relatively short we even went below 55 in a relatively short period of time so I acknowledge that and I'm I'm not going to you know that's why I try to address this head on because I know people are be like why is we talk about dominance but you know the the the the the crazy thing about it is no matter how many times it puts in a new high on any pullback people like why does he not talk about it but um here we are I mean we went to 57% we're back down to 55 I think we're just in sort of a pullback like this one before ultimately going back up um and that's sort of the more conservative view the more the less conservative view is that we already had that and we're already we know we're just up here and you know this is going to quickly continue back to the upside right so definitely a couple of different ways uh that you could that you could look at it but um those are my views you know and and those are the reasons why I have been bullish on bitcoin dominance for the last two and a half years since really since like May of 2021 um and I know that we swept the lows on dominance going over here and really I mean I sort of flirted with the idea of being bullish on dominance over there I said okay it's going to be bullish going into Q4 of 2022 or sorry bullish and going into Q4 of 2021 but then in Q4 of 2022 I sort of doubled down on that even on the lower low and then you can see what happened right now if you exclude Stables it did bottom in May of 2021 right that's it did bottom in May 2021 and also by the way the social risk topped out in May of 2021 so in order to see Bitcoin dominance go down durably you need to see retail come back retail is not back new highs didn't bring him the having hasn't brought him what's going to bring him probably lose their monetary policy and when they turn the money printer back on but social risk just put in a lower low kind of like it did over here in mid 2019 which is yet another reason why I think Bitcoin dominance is going to keep on going up because as people leave that's when dominance goes up so when could it top I think it might top this summer when everyone's out touching grass not looking at the crypto Market because that's the best time for all Bitcoin pairs to bottom out when no one's looking at the market and no one is there to bid up the altcoins there's some people there that are B going to bid them up but they're just not enough people and there's just too many alt coins for them to all get that same bid and so they just keep on bleeding back to the king then finally altcoins capitulate they go down to 25 on their on their Bitcoin pairs right total three minus usdt by Bitcoin they go down to 0.25 everyone's Bitcoin Maxi and then finally Al altcoins bottom out against Bitcoin but I don't think we're there yet I do admit that you know we are you know we certainly have seen a pretty big pullback by Bitcoin dominance it's possible that that that pullback continues for a couple more weeks um but I I really do think that whatever happens over the next week or to it's just going to continue to go up um as we get as we get into the summer and then I I think it might finally top out uh potentially this summer it could take a little bit longer but that's my um that's my base case you know and and because I think that Bitcoin gives you exposure to the upside it minimizes your downside risk for me for Bitcoin USD I just take profits as it goes off the wristbands I have some exposure if we're still at at kind of like somewhat heated but not all the way up wristbands um but you know I think it's important to to also you know if you want to take profits as you get into some of those higher risk levels I think that's okay you know it doesn't mean you have to sell everything but you could offload a little bit that way if there is a larger pullback you at least took some off the table and if there's not a larger pullback then at least you um at least you still have some and and that's why I continue to think that Bitcoin is the better place to be and and my guess is that the way this will play out is that Bitcoin will will do better than the altcoin market going into the summer and um whether it goes up or down so if you want exposure to the upside Bitcoin gives that to you it minimizes your downside risk I think that'll all change after the FED pivots but it hasn't pivoted yet and again it doesn't mean that Bitcoin can't go down I mean it can and I'm I'm sort of just waiting for that moment when you start when you do get a Bitcoin pullback and then people are like well you know what about what about a Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio now that doesn't help but that's all just going to be recency bias you know the reality is that Bitcoin could drop you know 50% from here and be in line with where it normally is in the market cycle that's the reality that that I think a lot of people would not accept if it were to happen but that is the reality of the situation if you look at Roi after cycle Peak for Bitcoin and you take it out to the folling peak Bitcoin could drop 60% from here and be at where it was was in Prior Cycles at this point in the cycle right a 50 to 60% drop and if it happens everyone will be like well they did call the Bitcoin having right 50 to 60% drop and and it would be where it normally is and if that happens all Bitcoin pairs get rined right they get rined there's one thing I I want to finalize U with saying for a long time I I've said that I I think that you know all Bitcoin pairs bottom out before alt USD pairs do um whether the alt USD pairs putting in a higher low or a lower low or a double bottom whatever um but I've said that a lot of times alt USD pairs bleed for a few months after alt Bitcoin pairs find their bottom and we see that all Bitcoin pairs just put in a new load last week um but I I do think there is a potential case where all Bitcoin pairs bottom the same time is all USD pairs it's not I don't I wouldn't say it's my base case but there is a chance that that could happen if it does happen I think it would have to happen on a on a capitulation Wick so if you get a a sort of a capitulation Wick by Bitcoin where it drops a lot and all Bitcoin pairs are just capitulating and then you get a big bounce out of that upon money printer being turned back on there's a chance they could bottom at the same time base case is that they still bottom you know you still see all USD pairs bleed for a little bit even after all Bitcoin pairs bought them but I I could see I I could see an outcome where they bought them at the same time and so I I want to be diligent about exploring that idea based on on whatever potential outcome there is and the reason why I say that is because if there is you know sort of a larger capitulation in the in the traditional markets and it takes Bitcoin down with it um because actually bitcoin's holding up better right now than traditional markets if you look at at sort of the weekly time frame and you look at something like the bull market sport band you can see bitcoin's above its bull market sport band whereas the S&P is already at its bullmark sportband and the NASDAQ is below it and the Russell is below it right so crypto right now I mean bitcoin's actually holding up better than traditional markets that doesn't mean it's going to forever but it is so far this has been going on a long time and I I do wonder if there's there I I I wonder if there exists a scenario that when the unemployment rate hits 4% the market capitulates because it's kind of in that number that everyone keeps waiting for and waiting for and it just keeps not happening if it hits it I could see the market capitulating and then the FED coming to the rescue almost immediately and if that happens there does exist a scenario where alt bottom against Bitcoin the same time as they do against the US dollar in that scenario whether it's a higher low or lower low whatever right be aware of that it depends on if it's a capitulation or if it's a slow bleed right and what I mean by that is in 2019 it was a slow bleed and then eventually we got a capitulation again induced by a pandemic but there's other things that indu that can induce capitulations right we also had a capitulation over here in late 2018 and we didn't have a pandemic back then right so it depends on the nature of how this how this resolves right if you get a period of lower highs and lower lows like you know just kind of like that then Bitcoin dominance likely goes up until Bitcoin breaks below the 20we SMA if on the other hand you just get a massive capitulation wick on a 4% unemployment rate if inflation is still printing you know between 3 to 4% then they could it could occur at the same time so I just want to make sure that I communicate that potential idea it it's going to depend on the nature of the move right whether it's lower highs and lower lows or just simply a capitulation by the way there does theoretically exist a scenario and I will continue to keep mentioning it of a left translated cycle where all these views about a lower high lower low thing are invalid and we just keep on following what we historically have done um based on a a prior Peak rather than uh the final Peak so if you look at Peak to Peak from November it looks like bitcoin's ahead of schedule if from November 2021 if you take it from April 2021 it kind of looks like this is where it was in the last cycle and then you can see what happened so again it's not my base case to assume that but if that happens then then you likely get a much brutal bear Market that lasts for a lot longer so I hope that doesn't happen honestly um because it would probably lead to a more brutal be Market kind of like a DOT style crash if you can kind of just top out here and bleed into the sun then the the cycle might peek out when it normally does um if on the other hand you just get a left translated cycle it it'll be fun for a few months right I mean it would be fun for a few months but it would probably be over before you know it I mean you know maybe three more months and then it's over and then you have a brutal bare Market that is really difficult you know so I kind of hope it doesn't do that because of the ramifications that that would mean following it um but if it does that would just be you know just something to think about right something something at least to be aware of and I I I don't know I really don't know if that's going to play out or not I just I I I do have it in the back of my head of like um a what if right a what if thing like you know what if it it it continues to follow that again not my base case and and you know looking at things like um you know the S&P struggling and and looking at like the Russell struggling i' I mean you know if you were to if you were expecting a a left translated Peak that goes into the summer then I I would I would think that you would that would be on the back of of traditional markets continuing to go up but traditional markets are not going up right now they're actually they've started to go down um so that would be something to look at I mean you can look at maybe this trend line here on the NASDAQ and see that you know for it to hit that trend line it would still have to go down even even a little bit more um for the S&P that same trend line um you know if you draw it out here it would obviously be a lot further out if you take it to this one and just kind of call that a a fake out it would still have a little bit lower to go to ultimately hit that trend line but yeah I mean I think that's where we stand and you know I really don't know if the left translated peak's going to happen one crazy idea is that there could be scenario where the left translated Peak is already in you know in March I mean the dot crash actually started in March of the election year so that is that is a possibility again it's it's honestly not my base case it's really not but it is something to consider that when you have these and one of the reasons why it probably wouldn't be my base case is because the Bitcoin risk hasn't gone up all the way to the 0.9 to one wristband um if Bitcoin does do something like that and it just continues to go up then um then yeah I mean then you could have then you could have that example but I'm not I'm not I'm not seeing it at the moment right I'm just not seeing it at the moment um I'm instead you're you're just kind of seeing all Bitcoin pairs go down and you're also seeing all USD pairs go down right I mean a lot of these altcoins are are really struggling here right I mean like madic is is nowhere near you know where you would expect to see some of these coins in a in a left translated cycle I mean in fact it looks more like it's closer to final capitulation than it is a a major top you know um USD is only 50% off the low or 100% off the lows right it's not in the grand scheme of things is not like thousands of percent off the lows right Ada Litecoin they're they're they're closer to their lows than they are to their highs um so that's why I would I would potentially argue that it's more likely that you're getting closer to to the end of that than the than I a potentially left translated Peak um but that is something that uh sort of keep in mind um for for at least a little bit longer so again not my base case uh but there are certainly things to think about it and there's there was one thing that I I I do look at from time to time is as sort of like a uh a left translated um uh evidence or something and that's the the launch the QQQ um which you know tracks the NASDAQ it actually launched in um you know here in 1999 it actually launched around 48 $48 U which is funny because when Bitcoin spot ETF launched it launched at\n",

      "The video transcript presents a bullish case for Bitcoin dominance, arguing that it will continue to rise as the Federal Reserve maintains a tight monetary policy, leading to the altcoin market bleeding to the relative safety of Bitcoin. The speaker has been bullish on Bitcoin dominance for the past 2.5 years, and notes that it has recently hit a new cycle high of 57%, contrary to the expectations of many who believed it had already topped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker attributes this to the fact that Bitcoin dominance tends to top out after the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, rather than just based on the typical 4-year market cycle. The speaker suggests that Bitcoin dominance could continue to rise towards a 60% target, as the Federal Reserve keeps pushing back the timeline for interest rate cuts, which are seen as necessary for the altcoin market to start outperforming Bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker acknowledges that this process may not be linear, and there could be pullbacks and volatility along the way. The speaker emphasizes that the decision to invest in Bitcoin versus altcoins should be based on a risk-adjusted analysis, as Bitcoin is considered the least risky asset in the cryptocurrency space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also discusses the potential for a short-term bounce in Ethereum's price relative to Bitcoin (ETH/BTC), but suggests that any such bounce would likely be rejected at the bull market support band and ultimately lead to further downside. The speaker's base case is for ETH/BTC to bottom out in June or July, potentially coinciding with the timing of the next Federal Reserve rate cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the speaker provides historical analysis on the seasonal trends in Ethereum's and Bitcoin's performance, noting that altcoins tend to underperform Bitcoin during the summer months. The speaker also examines the relationship between Bitcoin dominance and the cryptocurrency market's performance around Bitcoin halving events, suggesting that Bitcoin dominance could see a spike in the third quarter of the year, similar to what has been observed in previous halving cycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker further elaborates on the potential for altcoin capitulation, noting that many altcoins have been in a macro downtrend, exhibiting lower highs and lower lows against Bitcoin. The speaker suggests that this process may not be linear, and there could be short-term bounces and volatility along the way, but the overall trend is for altcoins to bleed against Bitcoin.\n",

      "The speaker also discusses the potential for specific altcoins, such as Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), to see further downside against Bitcoin.

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse we are now at the or about to be at the 2024 Bitcoin having this is the fourth having the first one was in November of 2012 I believe second one July of 2016 the third one may of 2020 and then now the fourth one April of 2024 and as far as I'm I mean it's if you're in the states it's April 19th but Bitcoin is a global thing and UTC time is April 20th so the having will then theoretically be on April 20th for those operating under UT C time at this moment we have two blocks to go as you can see there's no way to know exactly how long it'll be uh some of them get taken out really quickly some of them obviously take a lot longer it's you know somewhat random so we don't know I mean you know it could be 10 more minutes it could be half an hour could be an hour all right there's no way to know how long it'll be but we'll keep an eye on it currently we have two blocks to go right so once we get to one block then I guess it'll be a little bit more exciting but right now we have two blocks to go and and Bitcoins currently coming in at around 63,0 743 so um we'll keep an eye on that you know there's certainly been a pretty bad week in the markets not just crypto but also in the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ as well uh you might have noticed in fact that the uh the NASDAQ and the S&P have fallen back to their B Market support bands the nasdaq's actually below it and so if again there's no guarantee right but if there is sort of a posst having dump uh keep an eye on that bull market support band by Bitcoin because it's it's you know it's it's not that much further down all things considered and and we know that the nasdaq's already there I mean the nasdaq's already below that level um and so I I think it's important to just kind of recognize that and if if memory serves me correct there was actually a dump right after 2016 having as well but I would I would keep an eye on that here as we go into the having just in case we do see something like that still two blocks to go also bear in mind that as measured from the peak Bitcoin is well ahead of schedule right well ahead of schedule and so I've I've said many many times that whenever Bitcoin sort of falls back into line with the prior Cycles that's when altcoins theoretically bottom out on their Bitcoin Pairs and and the AL the altcoin Reckoning will will then end but as far as I'm concerned again considering that the altcoin Reckoning is based on their Bitcoin Pairs and considering that altcoins keep putting in new lows on their Bitcoin pairs I think we are about to enter into a probably a somewhat boring summer where all Bitcoin pairs finally bottom out we've been waiting forever uh to see that happen and we are now about to I believe see that happen still two blocks remaining all Bitcoin pairs in fact put in a new low last week um so I do think this summer we could very well see that if you if you look at things like the social risk I mean the social risk is so low right now it's at 0.14 so despite the fact that we're knocking on the door of the fourth Bitcoin having no one cares you know I mean there's obviously people watching that care but in the grand scheme of things no one really cares and that's it's kind of interesting right it's kind of interesting to some degree um we still have let me reload this I I I don't think I need to but um two blocks to go but yeah I mean like like considering where the social interest was back over here compared to where it is today it's kind of crazy you know I mean it's just remarkable just how much lower the social interest is today and I think it has nothing to do with Bitcoin or whatever it just has to do with with this long and pain rate hiking cycle by the fed and they are trying to stay as high as and as long they're trying to keep rates as high as they can for as long as they can but I don't think they have that much more Runway I do think they're going to be forced to cut relatively um well sooner than probably the market thinks all right we have one block to go uh approximately nine minutes we'll see it could be any time but we do have one block to go there we go check it out over here I mean let me reload this should it should go down about 18 minutes according to that one but again it's just a guessing game no one knows exactly how long it'll take but it could be at any moment for the fourth Bitcoin having and of course we will keep an eye on the price of Bitcoin um I actually did live stream the last having as well um back uh four years ago almost four years ago it was May of 20120 but I did that live stream um so not very long guys uh we are almost there just a couple more just a few more minutes and we will be at the uh the fourth the fourth Bitcoin having so we'll see what price does um and and how that reacts but um and I'm also gonna I'm also going to see how eth Bitcoin reacts because it had a reaction after the spot ETF to the upside I don't really think it's necess I mean it could do that again it doesn't have to you guys know my thoughts on eth bitcoin I think it probably bottoms out this summer um but short-term reactions obviously are are very hard to predict just like the the the reaction of e Bitcoin after the spot ETF right it shot up and then just bled back down and put a new lows so I don't really know what the short-term reaction is going to be after the having is here but I do imagine there's going to be quite a lot of volatility in the markets um and we'll talk a little bit more about that after the having is actually here so still about one we got one block to go the last block was three minutes ago um you can see they're about every 10 minutes or so but it's not exact right sometimes they go a lot quicker than other times so not too long to go why do I think it's taking so much longer to rate 60% dominance this cycle than last I I think just because of inflation and the amount of time it's taking uh the FED to to really get that under control it's been delaying rate or rate cuts for a long time I think that's the reason so one block to go the last block was found about three minutes ago um Bitcoin still trading at $ 63,9 uh so we'll see what happens with that after the having is actually here make sure you guys subscribe if you're not subscribed and by the way thank you for um subscribing and and helping me to get to 800,000 subscribers today by the having that was pretty cool I saw someone make a snarky comment where they said can't wait to celebrate you passing 800,000 subscribers for the second time later this year after this summer low and there's probably some truth to that statement I I could totally see that happening like going above 800 then going below it for a little B then going back above it still one block to go um last block was found last block was four minutes to go so on average again it's about every you know every 10 minutes or so um but we will see how's everyone doing today Bitcoin is it oh there it goes there it goes the having has it looks like it has occurred so there it goes the next having will be approximately April 17th of 2028 and the new block subsidy will be 1.56 3 Bitcoin um per block uh but the having has arrived let me tweet it out pretty cool huh these are always pretty cool because they only have you know they only occur every four years you know so and I I do think that these events are are much more exciting to me than like um you know a lot of the other events that people talk about like the merge and like the Litecoin having really who cares about that but all these other events um you know the Bitcoin having I I think is is much more much more meaningful and I you know without Bitcoin the reality is is all you guys that are going full DJ into the altcoin market those altcoins wouldn't exist without Bitcoin so pay your respects to the king um especially on on the Bitcoin having so uh we will in fact see how the market reacts um to this let's see how it's doing we're at 638 638 eth is still not moving um eth Bitcoin still not moving again my base case here is eth Bitcoin bleeds into the Summer where it finally bottoms okay um it's been a long journey for eth Bitcoin to drop but I I think there's a little bit further for it to go to find its its final low and then it should I think it'll bottom this summer I think that Bitcoin dominance will Top uh in the next couple in the next few months or so and I'll tell you what I think's going to happen what I think's going to happen um is that look closely at at at Bitcoin right look very closely at Bitcoin you see where it is you see how high above the 20 we estimate it is you see that now look at eth you see how it's not that much further off of it and it's already Wick to it look at salana it's also been wicking off the 20we ese now look at some other alts look at Ada it's below the 20 we look at link it's below the 20 we look at dot it's below the 20 we look at madic below the 20 we look at Avalanche right below the 20 we a lot of these alts are below the 20 we we saw this exact same thing just before rake Cuts arrived in 2019 we saw all coins go below their 20we what happened next was that Bitcoin did something like this did something like this and during that period That's when Bitcoin dominance finally topped as Bitcoin chopped around just above the 20we moving average so what I think's going to happen over the next few months I think bitcoin's going to chop around um you know and and certainly that could mean going into the 50s um it could mean going back up to the week SMA you know in the high 60s as well it could bounce around but I think what's going to happen is that altcoins are going to get pinned under their bull market support bands while Bitcoin still stays above it for a little while right and when that happens when alts get pinned underneath their bull market support ban then when Bitcoin rallies when it gets relief rallies that's when all Bitcoin pairs break down so I think what happens is Bitcoin hangs around here for a little bit during that period it eats the altcoin market up then Bitcoin dominance tops before like not not 100% sure about this they don't hold me to this but I think Bitcoin dominance could top before Bitcoin USD Falls below its 20we moving average that's what I think right I think that it could top before that happens um and then as it goes underneath the 20we SMA then we just figure out how much damage the FED did and and then we just put up with them until they cut rates right aggressively and then and then the market goes back up but when that happens then guess what happens then Bitcoin dominance goes down during that period but we're not there yet I I still think that Bitcoin needs to chop up the altcoin market for just a little bit longer I think it needs to send e Bitcoin to about 03 to 04 but we're really not that far away nor normally when eth Bitcoin breaks down it takes about eight weeks it takes about eight weeks and and we you know we just completed basically the first week um so look for I I think about June you know I I think about the June time frame is when you might see eth Bitcoin bottom it could be a little bit later like maybe July it's going to depend on what eth Bitcoin does over the next couple of weeks if eth Bitcoin bounces over the next couple of weeks then I might say July but if it just kind of keeps fading which is my base case then maybe by June but in the meantime Bitcoin should chop around and during that chop for the next several weeks we should see theoretically we should see Bitcoin dominance go finally to 60% after all this time right after all this time I I I think we're we're almost there um I think we just need you know not not that much longer but I I think we are in the phase we're in the phase and I saw this happen last cycle where basically Bitcoin chopped around up here right after eth Bitcoin broke down after gold broke out it chopped around and during that time altcoins got pinned underneath their 20we moving average so when Bitcoin bounced the altcoin still stayed below their 20 we right they just stayed below their 20 we even though Bitcoin was bouncing above it so then when Bitcoin dropped below its 20 week right before that Bitcoin dominance top so the Milestones still look for Bitcoin dominance to go to 60% eth Bitcoin .03 to 04 um and and watch Bitcoin chop up the altcoin market here for for a couple more months after that I I think you might actually see some of these all alt Bitcoin pairs bottom out um at least the ones that are not relics right the truth is is 99% of them are relics but the 1% that are not relics might actually bottom out on their Bitcoin pairs uh by that point and some of them probably already have right I mean you know there's some that are up a lot those have probably already bottomed on their Bitcoin pairs but there's a lot of them that're just you know they're collectively the altcoin market is just putting in new lows right collectively you can see that they just put in a new low last week um so considering there's not really a strong reaction just yet by Bitcoin you know it might we might have to wait till next week to see what's going to happen um you also have the 8-week SMA which is up at around 67k I would keep an eye on that as well you know that was that was essentially what Bitcoin struggled with back in 2019 it basically kept bouncing around and that 8we moving average kept giving it trouble so I think we're entering into that phase I I think we're entering into that phase right now um where bitcoin's going to chop alt up for a little bit and then the next question that you might ask me is well then if this is the case if it really is 2019 repeat um how low does it have to go right how low does it actually have to go first of all no one on this Earth knows the answer to that question because it's going to be dependent on a lot of things that we don't have any control over right it's going to be dependent on monetary policy um could be dependent on geopolitical events but I will say this and I will say this if you go back and look and I I showed this earlier right if you go back and look at Roi after cycle Peak I just want you to look at this chart you know don't get mad at me right don't get mad at me just look at the chart and see where we are this cycle right we we have plenty of wiggle room here you know Bitcoin could drop all the way back down here and it still be in line with prior Cycles right that's what's crazy about it like it could drop all the way back down here to 60% below the high and still be where we were in the last two cycles at this time Bitcoin has that luxury altcoins do not because if Bitcoin does that most alts put in new lows right I said that I've said that for years I've said a lot of altcoins can put in new lows in the having year right in the having year even if Bitcoin doesn't even if Bitcoin just kind of stays in line with prior Cycles so be aware of that that if Bitcoin just gets that correction back to where it normally is around this time um keep an eye on those altcoins because that's where they really can uh can can take a hit but again we'll see I mean you know I I still think dominance is going to go up to that 60% level um I don't think it should take too much longer you know I mean if you look at it here it's possible for us to even go to you know back up to 57 58% in the just the next few weeks right in just the next few weeks um 60% is really not that far away when you think about it I mean I know I know when I said it at 38% 60% seemed like a pipe dream right but we've already gone to 57 you know 60% it's only another 3% above that so if e Bitcoin goes to the 03 to 04 Target that I've said forever if you have things like Ada going to 400 SATs and stuff I mean there you got it I mean you got your you got your 60% Bitcoin dominance um we're not that far away right we're not that far away and I think like we're you can kind of see the cycle you can kind of see how the cycle plays out right as as Bitcoin lifts the altcoin market up Bitcoin dominance goes up and then the next part of the cycle theoretically theoretically right again I could be wrong um believe it or not I do get things wrong a lot but theoretically the next phas the cycle is Bitcoin chops the altcoin market up up here and during that time Bitcoin pairs bleed Bitcoin dominance goes to 60% after Bitcoin dominance is at 60% then I think it falls below its 20we moving average so I'll say that again once Bitcoin dominance goes to 60% or thereabouts I think that Bitcoin USD will then fall below its 20we moving average and then how low alts go just depends on how low Bitcoin goes because by that point you go to the period where all Bitcoin pairs could actually go up no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD we're not at that phase yet I don't think we're at that phase yet but I think that phase is going to start this summer so I think that phase will start this summer um and that that'll that that'll be like an interesting shift in the cryptoverse right but in the meantime I still think alts need to you know need to go lower on their on their Bitcoin pairs the alt season that all of you seek the alt season that you guys want can only occur from higher Bitcoin dominance levels right it I I think it needs to occur at least up here once you're up there then you're you're sort of you can get ready for a potential um you know for for other types of moves in the market right but you know and I know what some of you guys are thinking you're like what about the last you know what about all these alts that have already done well guys you know all season again is when Bitcoin dominates craters like this that's what that's what all season is this is not all season this is Bitcoin season and everyone thinking that because their altcoin went up with Bitcoin it was altseason but it was never altseason it was Bitcoin season and some of the altcoins uh tagged long for the ride alt season is when Bitcoin profits go into alts you're not seeing that right you're seeing you're seeing the reverse of that you're seeing Bitcoin suck the liquidity out of alt and it's because Bitcoin sucks the liquidity ad Vols which is what causes it generally to just chop around up here for a while right it's because it sucks that liquidity out of alts alts aren't sucking liquidity out of anything right they're just they're just you know they're just the liquidity is leaving them going back to bitcoin um so it's interesting how this cycle is playing out I do think it will continue to play out uh in the way that um that I've been describing qualitatively quantitatively again it's it's it's hard to know um exactly you know where the highs are for dominance and where the lows are for eth Bitcoin and whatnot but um that's what I would expect anyways there you have it you have the 2024 Bitcoin having bitcoin's at you know 63 60 63.8k um I don't know I really don't know what's gonna happen this weekend I maybe it'll just be a boring weekend you know I don't know I just know that uh you know the NASDAQ and the S&P didn't really have the best end to the uh best end of the week but we'll see what Bitcoin does here um any questions yeah gold is doing pretty well but um it I mean it it's that phase of the cycle right it's you know pre- rate Cuts that's what normally when gold starts to do well and if if Bitcoin if Bitcoin does move up into the uh into the weekend the eight week is what you look for right the 8we it can go slightly above it too just like in 2021 and in and in 2019 but I would I would keep an eye on that eight moving average um going out into the um at least probably the next couple of weeks right like the next few weeks keep an eye on the 8 week and if we go to the bull market support ban first um then obviously the 8 week SM will roll over but if we go up to the eight-week first then\n",

      "if Bitcoin does move up into the uh into the weekend the eight week is what you look for right the 8we it can go slightly above it too just like in 2021 and in and in 2019 but I would I would keep an eye on that eight moving average um going out into the um at least probably the next couple of weeks right like the next few weeks keep an eye on the 8 week and if we go to the bull market support ban first um then obviously the 8 week SM will roll over but if we go up to the eight-week first then it's already you know it's just over 67 just over 67k on shorter time frames right if you look at shorter time frames you can see that that um if we look at Bitcoin USD this is almost the opposite of what we saw um it's almost the opposite of what we saw going into the spot ETF actually because going into the spot ETF we didn't see this trend line break until after the spot ETF right this time this trend line broke before the spot ETF and and eventually we came down here and and ran the lows right we we ran these lows we um swept the lows after the spot ETF this time we still haven't swept this low we've gotten pretty close to it still haven't swept it yet you do have this trend line this is the same trend line that it kind of held resistance at right there a little bit right there as well so if you do see a move back up I would also I would also watch that trend line which is going to correspond right to that eight-week moving average but um that's where we are let's see if the Bitcoin dominance can still run here I've seen some people speculate that they some people have thought that dominance would top around the having I still think like the spot ETF it's going to go a little bit higher you know I do think it's going to run a little bit longer um and then and then I think it'll it'll probably top out sometime maybe sometime later this summer is my guess that's just my guess all right um twin limbo fees someone says did it half yet yes it did when accounting for M2 to bitcoin reach a new high yet uh I believe so yeah yeah it did yeah we can even Connect the Dots here and see that it almost lines up perfectly yeah I mean it it did it did hit a a new high when accounting for um uh for M2 is a longterm still up for Bitcoin well I mean I look guys markets are are are volatile in both directions I do think long-term Bitcoin still goes up but I also you know I also think that um it wouldn't be the worst thing to to have a a boring summer let all Bitcoin pairs bottom out that's kind of my view um but yeah I I do think long term it's it's up for Bitcoin but you're G to have I you're going to have some speed bumps along the way for the last two and a half years I think you know just having your crypto portfolio be Bitcoin heavy was kind of the easiest thing to do especially in a Bitcoin dominance uptrend I think this summer late summer especially I think think that you know could theoretically change as Bitcoin dominance you know maybe tops out um later this summer but um those are my views um um someone says they can't bring themselves to sell Bitcoin uh I don't think I mean yeah you gota you got to do what makes sense for you you know I mean also too I mean a lot of times when you sell Bitcoin you have to consider the tax implications as well um you know when I talk about what I think bitcoin's going to do like it doesn't mean like oh you should go buy or sell Bitcoin it's just dubious speculation guys I mean I'll let you on a little secret I don't know what's going to happen you know um you guys have to remember that you really have to remember that it's just dubious speculation someone says the FED supposed to cut rates this summer right now the market doesn't think they're going to cut rates this summer I think there's a chance they could cut rates this summer but right now the market says no rate Cuts until September more than likely I think they're probably going to cut in June or July um but that's that's just my guess that's just my guess do I have any altcoin picks for when for when dominance stps out I think that you know I I think the main thing to look at will be ethereum and obviously there's other things you can look at as well but the the the the E Bitcoin should give you the sign you know because I E Bitcoin dropping you know normally is a bad Omen for the altcoin market I I told I told you guys guys that for years so when it dropped a couple of weeks ago I warned you know I warned that altcoins were likely going to get a big drop and they did did a lot of altcoins did get a big drop a lot of people are telling you to buy the dip on alts it doesn't mean you can't have short-term rallies back up in alts but I I do I do think there is a good chance that um eth Bitcoin is going to go 0.3 to 0.4 and if that happens I I do I really do think that altcoins will take a bigger haircut than they already have someone says have you not paid attention there's absolutely nothing that suggests a rate cut in June you know here's the funny thing um if you watched what I said in 2022 about monetary policy I said that the FED would go to 5 and a half per. and no one believed me right everyone said no they're going to stop at 3% they're going to stop at three and a half now they went to 5 and a half per. so when no one believed it I said 5 and a half% would be the terminal rate now what I think's happening everyone believes higher for longer higher for longer is getting priced in now look at the look at the market only two rate cuts are being priced in for an entire year and you know what happened now that only two rate cuts are priced in do you know what happened the S&P is dropping right the S&P is dropping the NASDAQ is dropping last cycle the FED cut one one meeting after all Bitcoin pairs broke down it cut it cut one meeting after all Bitcoin pairs broke down I don't think they're going to cut in May okay unless something catastrophic happens between now and may I don't think they're going to cut in May but there is a chance they cut in June or July right there is now again you know you're probably looking at it and saying you know what's been smoking there's like only a 16% chance or 37% chance in July but I'm telling you these probabilities change all the time when I said the terminal rate was 5 and a half% this Market did not expect anywhere near 5 and a half per. I think that people are underestimating how quickly the FED will pivot when the labor market shows weakness that's what I think people are underestimating they will pivot very very quickly if the labor market shows weakness you have two more unemployment rate prints between now and the June meeting okay two more and do you know what happened at the June print for the unemployment rate last year that was the big spike up that was the big spike up look at the unemployment rate in um in uh last year do you see here it was dropping February March April remember you get the April data in May you get the May data in June in June we got the May data and it spiked from 34 to 37 now imagine if it goes from if it goes from 38 or 37 to four in June just before the the FED meeting on June 12th if you see it if they see it at 4% I think there's a good chance they going to cut which would be funny because that might be just about one month after all Bitcoin pairs finally break down so you know I know I know No One Believes it but I've said this a thousand times probably the pricing out of rate Cuts causes them to get priced back in because once the market believes the FED once they believe them then businesses change their spending they lay people off and it changes it it it affects the economy but you have to convince the animal spirits that they mean business the FED has finally convinced people but in the process of convincing people they're probably going to have to start cutting sooner than the market expects so that's why I think they could cut earlier than September I'm not married to that idea honestly the the the economy has been very very strong but I I saw something similar last cycle just be aware that they could cut before September especially if if the markets keep unfolding like we see them unfolding right now uh Bitcoin dominance is now at 55. 72 so it's still doing pretty well so far someone says I heard that since the FED can't control inflation the likely of rate Cuts happening in July is unlikely to September for the election before we probably get one I don't know I mean you know in 2019 we got one in in July and then September and October some or no September and then yeah something like that um I think it was July September and October I think they'll give us I I think they're going to give us one in the summer I that's what I think but just the token one you know probably not enough to move the needle but someone says same story fed cuts and Bitcoin dominates hasn't been wrong yeah for those who are just tuning in the uh the Bitcoin having has occurred um so the block rewards have been reduced to 1.56 3 and the next having is now scheduled or approximately going to be April of 2028 it's probably going to be earlier in the year than April every cycle it seems to move up a little bit um so maybe it'll be March um or something but that's where it is right now uh someone says the S&P is hitting its bullmark sport Ben you think it'll have a bounce that's a great question I was looking at that at the close I was like oh what are the chances it's going to close right at that bullmark sport band right what are the chances right there at the 20we SMA uh yeah it definitely could right I mean it definitely could bounce off of this level the thing that's a little concerning is that the NASDAQ closed below it um so it's not as obvious like I mean I would have preferred for the NASDAQ to have closed above it uh in that case to to be a little bit more optimistic about the S&P bouncing so I don't know if you look at at at year-to-date Roi of um of the like let's go look at at the equity side of things year-to dat Roi and we're just going to look at at the S&P 500 in in election years so if you look at the S&P 500 this is uh 2024 and now average it out with all prior election years right so a lot of times in election years there's weakness so we're currently on day you know 110 oftentimes there's weakness until about day 140 in the 140s so about one more month of weakness so it's possible that it gets a bounce right it's possible that it gets bounce actually you can see over here the S&P fell to the 20we SMA and then it got a bounce right same thing it just fell about the same amount about 6% to the 20we SMA so you could get like a two- week rally um but it doesn't mean that the 20we SME will will hold I I could still see continued weakness into you know into um kind of the May time frame which is normally when you see that that weakness in in election years make sure you guys subscribe if you're not subscribed I would appreciate that and I do appreciate everyone subscribing and getting getting the channel to 800,000 subscribers yeah we we passed 800,000 um just uh just a few hours ago so I do appreciate everyone doing that and subscribing so uh let's see I I I think we we probably are going to see Bitcoin at the 20we SME um sometime you know before the end of May is my guess and it could happen a lot earlier than that but I do think it I mean it's been a long time since we tested it so I I I think we're GNA fall back into it on the not so distant future in a previous video you said it also Bott them out after they bought against Bitcoin how long do you think that'll take it's hard to say you know there sometimes it it if it plays out like it did 2019 it would just take a few months after after all Bitcoin pairs bought them but you have to remember every cycle is slight slightly different I could Envision a scenario where they bought them at the same time as their USG pairs I could especially considering how late how much later in the cycle it's occurring um but yeah if it were to play out like last cycle they you know they would bleed the USD pairs would bleed a little bit B longer than the Bitcoin pairs um you know not drastically longer but you know slightly longer but that's a good that's a good thing about alts because it's during that bleed that you can you can figure out which alts are are are strong ones because you know when they bottom out against Bitcoin that gives you the signal that it's not a relic right I'll say that again if you're altcoin hunting and you want to know which ones are going to do well in the future look to see which ones are setting lows against Bitcoin as Bitcoin Falls that's what you look for that's what I looked for last cycle it worked out really really well I would look for that just look to see which ones there's some alts that just keep putting in new lows against Bitcoin let me show you an example let me show you kind of a a process that I did last cycle so there were a lot of altcoins that you could have looked at last cycle but there's there were some I don't really want to get into it there were some that were putting in higher lows in their Bitcoin pairs there were some that were holding their lows in their Bitcoin Pairs and there were others that were going lower on their Bitcoin pairs the ones that just keep going lower on their Bitcoin Pairs and do not form a bottom over the next like say three to six months they're likely relics and you don't really need to pay attention to those if they form a bottom over the next three to six months on their Bitcoin pairs those are the ones that will likely do well so that's what you should look for in my opinion look for the ones that can can set a low against Bitcoin and then spend three to six months bouncing off of that low someone says eth Bitcoin keeps put putting in new lows is it I haven't I'm not even looking at it right now I mean it's at 0477 um so yeah I I do think it's going to go to 03 to 04 and I I think it's probably going to happen by you know likely by June but we'll see this is this whole process has taken a lot longer than I thought it would if the unemployment rate hits 4% do you think they'll cut even if inflation is this High yeah I do I do I I think there's going to be overwhelming pressure for them too especially considering it's an election year I I think they're going to cut if if we hit 4% in unemployment especially if it's accompanied by the stock market dropping again if you're if you're just joining uh the Bitcoin having has already occurred um so you know I got to tell you guys like I I find days like today a lot more interesting and exciting than like the countdown to New Year's like I feel like for the countdown to New Year's it's like uh gotta stay up till midnight but um but I I guess I do stay up the past midnight a lot of nights but um but for the the having I I think it's it's a lot more exciting you know just to see the having sort of get ushered in having is not postponed um what are my thoughts on Nvidia my thoughts on Nvidia kind of I think Cisco might be a good blueprint for NVIDIA um because it kind of It kind of topped out in March of the election year in 2000 so I think probably what you're going to see happen here is you're you're you're just going to see it fall back in maybe into the five to 600 range um and then and then bounce into the summer that's probably my guess is what's going to happen someone says rip Tesla you know Tesla funny because you know I was very vocally bearish on it in 2022 and um unfortunately I did not pivot my view when it hit a 100 but one one lesson for all investors is that business Cycles take a long time to play out right a really long time to play out and you know these are all lower highs you know I mean that's what they are they're all lower highs they've always been lower highs and it's this sort of these devaluations of these larger companies that are going to eventually I think Force the FED to Pivot um so yeah I mean it's just the business cycle takes a long time a really long time to play out but you can see it playing out I mean you could see it it's just it it's taking a very long time to do so someone said I thought the having was taking us to 3.125 not 1.5 it did take us to 3.125 5 what you're looking at is you're looking at this is the this is going to be the new subsidy for the next having so this is a having countdown for the fifth having so the new subsidy after the fifth having will be 1.56 three so you're just looking at at what it'll be after the next having not what it is currently coin and Mara Mara is an interesting one because you know essentially what mea did last cycle just before those rate Cuts arrive you can see I was actually already looking at it um what it did last cycle was it sort of had this one this top a higher high and then it it came back down it it sort of swept this low here and then went back up for a lower High um so I I wonder if that's about to happen um where it it it gets a move back up somewhere off of these lows and then puts in a lower high and then it basically then just bleeds until until you get enough rate cuts to send everything back up right so basically you know and this is this is what I this is what I told people you know on ITC premium a while back was we were looking at this whole pattern over here um and it's it's actually been doing it's been copying it pretty closely for a long time um actually um as you can see because this pattern I we you know we talking about it you know months ago and it seems like it just keeps playing out right a high a higher high back to the range low maybe you get a lower High um and and then you you sort of just bleed until the FED gets to the last rate cut and then you and then you send it back up um so that would be my view on on on something like meor someone says I can't tell if this is Live Well Apollo is King it is live do I think the altcoin market cap can keep up with Bitcoin when bitcoin's greater than 10 trillion or do you think Bitcoin dominance will continue to hire at that point I don't think I mean I I think the I think the market is is an oscillator right if you look at Bitcoin dominance plus USD dominance I it tells a fairly compelling story you know I I I just think that we're essentially in a range and we just sort of bounce around this range where we go from um you know we go from alt season to bitcoin season to alt season to bitcoin season and we're just right now we've been in the long path up of Bitcoin season but eventually we'll get to you know to um to the point where we go back to all season but and again this is Bitcoin dominance plus USD dominance um and if you add in plus e dominance looks like this right I mean you can see I mean it really does look you know sort of like an oscillator and we just go you know from Blue Chips to altcoins to Blue Chips to altcoins to Blue Chips right and we're we're still just in the process of going you know of going back up to the top of this range but this here can be devastating for all Bitcoin pairs that that last move can be that final capitulation can be devastating for all Bitcoin pairs so I mean I'm not asking you to go make any changes to your portfolio right now you know these views I've expressed about Bitcoin dominance were expressed you know two and a half years ago at this point the meat of the Bitcoin dominance move is over yeah I still think it's going to go higher but you know it might only go to 60% I mean my my target has been 6 % and that's not really that much higher than where it is right now so I mean it's it's already gone to 57 but I do think we're going to see this go up to 60% here in the next uh few months am I worried about the SEC investigating ethereum I couldn't give a flying you know what about what the SEC is doing with e um I also don't really care if the spot ETF is approved all I care about is the eth Bitcoin pair that's all\n",

      "go higher but you know it might only go to 60% I mean my my target has been 6 % and that's not really that much higher than where it is right now so I mean it's it's already gone to 57 but I do think we're going to see this go up to 60% here in the next uh few months am I worried about the SEC investigating ethereum I couldn't give a flying you know what about what the SEC is doing with e um I also don't really care if the spot ETF is approved all I care about is the eth Bitcoin pair that's all I care about and and by the way the has had a pretty bad track record of going after anything so um they're pretty good at losing I'm not that concerned about what the SEC is doing I think that e Bitcoin bottoms out this summer I think people are probably going to blame it on the SEC or they're going to blame it on the rejection of the spot ETF but I don't really care what they blame it on um I I think it's going to be based on monetary policy and that's it and and you know all the narratives that come with that you know we can we can pretend like that stuff matters but I I just don't think it matters someone says happy Bitcoin happy Bitcoin having everyone yeah it's pretty cool day we got someone here from Australia do I think Bitcoin will fall to the less than point4 risk level in 2024 yeah I do I I do think it might not spend much time there but I I do think it will someone from Singapore and Texas even South Africa is uh here representing in Bulgaria another person we got a lot of people from like um Australia Mexico Quebec I've been to Quebec when am I going to DCA e well you know I mean when I DCA something I prefer that thing I'm dcing not to just bleed to bitcoin because if it is you just better off buying Bitcoin so the first thing that needs to happen for me to get interested in eth is it needs to bottom out on its Bitcoin pair you know I converted most of my eth to bitcoin here I converted more of it here or somewhere I don't remember where it was and then I converted the like basically almost the rest of it right there so i' I've been mostly out of ethereum for a long time in favor of Bitcoin just because I thought Bitcoin dominance was going to 60% but as it gets down into this range I I think um eth Bitcoin will likely bottom out and it'll start to go back the other way I've always wanted to go to New Zealand someone's from Greece I was going to go to Greece actually exactly four years ago I had a I had a trip planned for Greece in April of 2020 and you guys know what happened then right you guys know what happened in early 2020 so I wasn't able to go but I I was I was going to go to Greece and then that trip that whole trip got cancelled can I show the Bitcoin risk metric uh sure we can pull that up um it's currently at 638 currently 638 you can also view it like this as well that's where it currently is you see this guys I'm telling you eth is I think eth is going to fall back through this wedge just like it did over here after eth Bitcoin broke down you know after eth Bitcoin broke down over here it fell through the wedge eth Bitcoin just broke down and I mean to me it looks like it's just doing the same damn thing you know um we'll see if I'm wrong but last cycle eth Bitcoin broke down right here and then it fell through the eth USD fell through the wedge here eth Bitcoin just broke down and it looks like it's starting to fall back through that wedge someone says if we knew what was going to happen we'd all be rich that's a good statement that is true if everyone knew if we all knew what was going to happen uh we'd all be rich just buy Bitcoin and hold it until the fireworks start look guys I mean I'll be honest with you I mean the long-term winning strategy for Bitcoin is just DC it at low risk levels and ignore everything else that's the winning strategy I found for Bitcoin when the risk is low you buy when the risk is high you sell and you ignore everything else in between and usually if you do that you are very successful over the longer term can we take a look at the Bitcoin rainbow indicator yeah it's funny because it kind of topped out at that two and a half log line rule again I mean I know like it it you know a lot of people said no it's not going to happen but once again two and a half log lines down that's where it topped potentially what's funny is that this range over here corresponds exactly to where that that regression band would be someone ask if the having has already happened it has Bitcoin having on 420 feels good yeah let's just remember it as being on 420 I know some were going to be like oh it happen on April 19th but guys it's UTC time you know no one cares if you live in the states I live in the states but I operate on UTC time when it comes to bitcoin so as far as I'm concerned the having was on April 20th not April 19th in fact it's probably April it's yeah it's April 20th for more people in the world than it's April 19th Mi you guys subscrib if you're not subscribed um I think I think there's going to be some changes in the cryptoverse this summer I'm G to have to give you guys some new content because the dominance train is is probably going to be over this summer so um if you've been with me on that Journey we have a little bit longer to go I think but we're almost there what are my thoughts on the stock to flow model um oh look who's here Rob how long have you been here a couple minutes okay we got Rob here I just wanted to I don't want to I just want to say congratulations to your 800k subscribers that's a long time coming good job great job everybody loves you and uh I want to say congratulations for everybody who bought in the bar market and did their job to get to this point so I think uh we're in the right place at the right time that was it congratulations everybody did you see it come in in live Rob the um I was I was over on Tom crowns for a bit and I saw it coming live and it was it was the most anticlimactic thing I've ever seen I thought it was more climactic than watching the ball drop on New Year's Eve but please I was like that was it that was great yeah well I thought it was interesting because it's then like you know you go you immediately go look and you see what the price is doing you know um and of course wasn't doing a damn thing but no it never does anything but I mean that's what that's what we're we're here for to you know to go over the Long Haul and wait for the time and the risk band to drop like the last question that you've answered about you know are you g to get into ethereum so that's that's what I'm waiting for I think eth is probably gonna be bottoming out against Bitcoin uh maybe in two months or so we'll see yeah we'll see it's look it's been bleeding for how long two two and a half years I I this is the first I've heard you talk about it so I don't okay I'm not for sure I'm not for sure but yeah no this is good times so I uh no I just want to pop in and say that because this is we' got a lot of things to talk about over the next uh six to 12 months so yeah I mean after after Bitcoin dominance tops out we'll have to change the content that that we talk about I I don't I don't know if it's I still think 60% is low but we'll see Ian you could be right I mean it's possible it goes higher but I I think for me like 60% is like sufficient to like you know to start thinking about all Bitcoin pairs bottoming out because you also have to remember like one of the reasons why it might not go to 70% is because you have you know if you like if you look at usdt dominance plus usdc dominance um I mean that makes up six% you know and and in 2019 that dominance only made up like 1% right so I mean that's that's an extra 5% right there that that you know would theoretically have been in Bitcoin four years ago that's now not because um you can actually put it in the stable coin Market did you ever as you were going through this and and like Bitcoin dominance was was going down and not up was there a point where you're like ah maybe this isn't going to going to pan out like I thought it was I think the biggest time when I was a little uncertain was during the merge um but you know what you know what kept me motivated on it when you looked at dominance here you can see it put in a lower low um including Stables right in the going into the merge but the reason I I remained sort of steadfast on The View was because when you exclude Stables which is the whole point of dominance you know we're looking at dominance to try to figure out what it's doing against you know what altcoins are doing not what stable coins are doing dominance excluding stable coins never it was a higher low right may you know or the merge was a higher low the actual low on dominance was in May of 2021 which by the way may of 2021 is exactly when the social risk topped out right so in order for dominance to go down you have to have retail coming in if you don't have retail coming in dominance just naturally goes up you know I mean I feel like I feel like to some degree you don't need a reason for dominance to go up you need a reason for it to go down and the re and the way that it goes down is you have you know you have retail coming and and we're just we're not seeing that yet but I I I think we'll probably see it but it's just it's not here yet yeah isn't it isn't it great though when when things do work out the way that that you think they're going to work out and then you can say okay great that happened now on to the next thing that's all yeah no for sure I mean especially considering there's there's plenty of things that don't you know don't go the way we think I I don't know what you're talking about everything that I've called has been gold so when so when so when something goes the way you think it's it's always it's always nice exactly I know you've been doing pretty well on your altcoin plays here for the last few months right yeah not not too bad we and then uh I'm gonna get out of here in a bit because I gotta go pick up my I have to go pick up my wife she's at the at the the the wanis concert here in Puerto Rico but um but yeah um all coins were doing pretty good but we just did a video we took we talked about time and wristbands and we took a look at what it would be like to in the last cycle to do uh dollar cost averaging from 20 January 1st 2018 to the the having on May 11 2020 and then we took a look at what it would be if you did time and wristbands from January all the way up to uh the all-time highs in April and November and then we took a look at what it would be like if you would have done time and risk spends dollar cost averaging I should say $10 a day from uh the having of May 11 20120 into November 2021 and we took a look at it it was just it was interesting because like if you do just dollar cost averaging the best you actually would do would be just to stop as soon as you get to the having and just kind of let let let things flow as far as percentage it goes but if you would have done Dynamic DCA you would have actually like double or tripled uh your your Roi so yeah that was my big Spiel today if you can load it if you can load up your your dcas at lower wristbands then it helps right it certainly helps um I just think I think the reason why I've been so skeptical about alts is because I I just look at them as as still bleeding against Bitcoin you know um but you know there are some that have done really well I mean there's some there's no doubt about it they outperform Bitcoin um a lot but at least the larger market cap alts they just put in a new low last week you know know yeah like that's why I go back to these ideas of like you know it really hasn't made sense to DCA eth over Bitcoin or Ada over Bitcoin or dot over Bitcoin right because they all just keep on putting in new lows um but Bitcoin continues to St to to kind of take that liquidity but I mean I get it there there definitely are some altcoins that I know you've talked about that have outperform Bitcoin um by but those tend to be smaller market cap coins right they are and that and that's why like as we go into to this next this next Evolution this is this is why Ben I can't wait to talk to you about runes and layer 2 Solutions and wizard tokens I feel like you're trying to speak to me I just know it well thisen everybody I just want to pop in and say congratulations doing what you're doing Ben congratulations on your 800k I see Tom Crown is in is in the comment section you're a good com Company ladies and gentlemen congratulations we are right at the right place the right time Ben I'm taking off all right I'll see you next time see you guys all right guys um well I don't know I don't really know if I have any more any more things to add other than that um Tom says he's scheduling a stream now for 2028 I guess you can just schedule it April 17th and hope hope that it doesn't change between now and then that probably will let's see bitcoin's at 63k how did Rob dis appear wild Rob appeared oh yeah thoughts on the stock to flow model my my my my sort of thoughts on it are that it's it's it's generally going to be more optimistic than what actually happens um but it's still a decent model remember to subscribe guys if you have not yet subscribed I don't really know what else to talk about guys uh we've been going for about an hour here um and I don't know bitcoin's not really doing a whole lot right now it might I mean we might have to wait until until Monday um for uh for any of theity start I don't know it might not but wow we have 6,000 people viewing I didn't realize that how low can dominance go once it tops out um I don't know I'd probably look at this trend line and carry it all the way out till like I don't know maybe like [Music] 43% you could see something like this um it could do something like this maybe it'll do something like that you know I I I don't really know but it is possible for it to to play out like that all right guys we'll go ahead and wrap it up there I do appreciate apprciate everyone uh tuning in uh make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and also there is ITC premium uh the sale is ending this weekend I I think they're GNA take the sale down uh tomorrow uh just after the having so if you still want to get in you still have a little bit of time to lock in the low rate if you want to otherwise I will I will see you guys on the next video uh sometime theoretically probably tomorrow night but until then I will uh hope you guys have a good a good weekend and I will see you guys again next time bye\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the crypto today we're going to talk about Bitcoin the having approaches if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe crypto.com links in the description below make sure you guys check that out we're going to end the sale after the having sometime this weekend I don't know exactly when but I would go ahead and get it now if you want the subscription at the lower rate before we jump in I I would like to say thank you to everyone who is a subscriber here I like to kind of take a step back when I hit these major milestones and just say you know I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing it means the world to be at 800,000 subscribers you know when I started the channel I had no idea that it it would grow to be this big uh but here we are and I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing to the channel and I know I don't get everything right and I I do get things wrong um but I do appre appreciate you guys sticking with me uh either way so I just wanted to to acknowledge that and to say thank you to everyone for being a subscriber also the the having is is almost here and in fact by the time you watch this video the having's probably already happened um I'll try to get the video out here uh in a in a in you know 30 minutes or so um if we take a look when it's going to occur at least from when I'm recording this video it's going to be about 5 hours um but by the time you're watching this video it's probably going to be a lot less and it could already be behind us if you go look at the um at the the how many blocks it looks like we only have about 30 blocks to go so it is coming up really really soon and I I just think it's such a big event I'm going to try to live stream it that's my goal is to try to live stream the event uh it is in about again 5 hours it's going to be a little tricky cuz that's going to sort of correspond with some uh bedtime routines for my kids uh but I will try to to to live stream it if I can uh so do look out for that here in the next four or I guess by the time you're watching this video it'll be a different time but ideally I'm going to try to get get on here live by 8:30 Eastern um is my goal but again no promises so Bitcoin is is currently at at 64k we're going to keep this pretty short um because I mean you guys know my thoughts on the market but I do just want to say you know there there's a couple of different scenarios that could play out and I'm sure you've seen me talk about him a thousand times you've probably seen everyone else talk about him a thousand times the the sort of the two main short-term things so sort of the most likely outcomes in the short term are either you go straight to the 20we SMA following the habing or you get a bounce first to go just north of the 8 week moving average and then you resolve to a a lower low in May um off of off of whatever low this is you know so those are the sort of the two most likely shortterm outcomes to me again I I don't know which one will play out I I could certainly find evidence for both I will say you know with the S&P 500 at its own bull market support ban I I really do Wonder like well if if the S&P can go to it 20we SMA why can't Bitcoin you know I mean it's been a long time and with the S&P it had been really since November since it had been at its 20we SMA and now it's there once again and I wonder like you know with Bitcoin what's to keep it from going to its own 20we SMA it hasn't seen it since really mid October so if the S&P 500 can go there why can't Bitcoin in fact it's not even just the S&P if you were to look at at eth you can see it's been wicking down to its 20we moving average already you can see the riskier assets are already hitting it um if you look at at total three you can see that it's already been wicking down to its bull market support band so as you go you know further up the risk curve it's easier for those assets to hit that 20we SMA because when Bitcoin sneezes the the the altcoin market gets annihilated and you can see that I mean Bitcoin is still well above its 20we moving average in fact I mean in fact for it to go to its 20we SMA it would require about another 15 % drop from the current prices the problem with that for things like eth and and alts is that if Bitcoin were to do that then they likely go below their bull market support bands and this is exactly what we saw in 2019 right we saw eth go below its bull market support band after that local top just after eth Bitcoin broke down before Bitcoin did so that when Bitcoin bounced off of its 20we ese in the short term even didn't hold it as support eventually it bounced off of it ethusd basically just held resistance at the bull market support band so I I do think there there's some some reason to think it could play out like that you know as much as there there very well could be sort of a relief into late April early May um just keep an eye on on the 20we SME because you know the hard part with it is that you know you can look at at at prior local tops right you can look at things like 2021 and and 2019 and see that they had these rallies back up to the 8-week moving average on their first weekly close below the 8we moving average right so the first weekly close below the 8we right here in 2019 we rallied right back above the 8we and then formed a lower high in 2021 right same type of thing right go below the 8 we and then rally on back up the thing is is like we could see a weekly close below the 8we but we haven't necessarily even seen it yet also note that in 2019 after you had that rally back above the 8we it was after a 34% drop you know at this time Bitcoin has really only dropped about the same amount that it has been about 20% right I mean you know as much as it might feel like it's it's been more brutal this time that's only because the altcoin market is getting hammered but that's what alts do best in you know when Bitcoin sneezes alts get annihilated so you can see that so far this is a pretty standard drop for Bitcoin right 20% nothing too different from what we've seen um but do note that while it is 20% the the rally back to the 8we SMA in 2019 occurred after it had gone down you know closer to 30% which would actually get you near that 20we moving average so it's really hard to say and and while it is convenient of course to compare to 2019 and early 21 because you know I'm sure everyone would like that rally back up to the8 week SMA there's also other examples uh like like 20 late 2021 where you get something like this where you you know you're putting in these weekly closes where the Wicks are lower right you can see that right the Wicks are lower there as well just like they were over here um but you ended up just getting a capitulation down right so there's no guarantee right there's no guarantee with the market and I think like I I think honestly we're not going to you know next week will be sort of the decision point on on if you're going to bounce off of it or not um this week I imagine it's not going to you know we're not going to fully know I mean this you know it's already Friday anyways but yeah I I think it's just I mean it's certainly interesting because you're not only looking at at Bitcoin sort of slowly fading back in uh but you can see that a lot of other markets are as well right like the S&P is down to its bull market support band eth is down to its bull market support band or at least it has been wicking there it's not there at the current moment but it has been for the last couple of days off and on and then you have some altcoins that are below their 20we SMA already right I mean um I'm sure a lot of them are right I don't know if link is yeah link is Ada is Litecoin is not surprisingly madic is um dot is I mean a lot of them are already below their Market sport band so you can see that like the stronger assets are still above it Bitcoin is still above it right now but you know I I look at these other markets you know even the Russell the Russell is below it right so this is a great example of how the S&P is at the 20 we but the Russell is below it so you could see something happen very very similar in crypto where Bitcoin goes to its 20 we and when it does if and when it does then maybe alts go below it right that could could very well play out sometime after the having whether you get a rally to the 8we SMA or not right and again I don't know um if we're going to go to the 8 week ese next week or if it's going to be like you know a month later I could easily come up with a reason for either scenario easily easily it it's going to depend on what your bias is um so I I really I really can confidently say I don't know which one's going to play out but I will say that regardless of whether you get a relief to the 8we or not my expectation is that Bitcoin will go to the 20we moving average within the next few weeks right you know within probably either this month or next month is my guess I mean it's been a long time right I mean it seems like we're due for it in 2019 you know it it took about 25 weeks you know something like that in you know 2020 or so all the way through 2021 we fell back into it in in May in fact and that was about 32 weeks we're currently at what 26 weeks right so my guess is you know sometime in the next 6 weeks we're going to find ourselves at the bull market support band and then we'll see what's up again my guess is that if if Bitcoin sort of chops around in this range for a few months that's what should send the Bitcoin dominance to 60% right so if it goes down to the 20e Ese and then it bounces back up for a little bit to the 8we ese or vice versa goes to the a week first and then goes to the 20 week it's that chopping process that should break the altcoin market down and I mean you can see it already happening you know with eth Bitcoin which is something we've been following you know for a long time you know it's now at 0482 now it is you know talking about this sort of stuff on the the sort of the cusp of a major Bitcoin event you know there could be counter Trend rallies for this stuff but again you know my guess is that eth Bitcoin is is just sort of doing something like this after breaking down where it it sort of TR to hold on for a week but inevitably it keeps on bleeding into into the summer months where maybe it finally can potentially bottom so that is my view here going into into the having remember if there is a larger drop in the crypto verse uh following the having whether it's immediately after or whether it's delayed by a few weeks one thing to remember right one thing that I I I think you should remember is that when you measure things from the peak and you go Peak to Peak Bitcoin is ahead of schedule by a lot right it really is it can afford to give back a lot of that and still be in line with prior Cycles we've said that forever this is why I've said Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio because it's going to outperform the altcoin marketing till QE Returns the problem for alts you know I'll tell you the problem for alts is that if Bitcoin just drops back down here to get back in line with the prior Cycles just like last cycle it dropped back in line to get to get back in line with its prior cycle if Bitcoin drops here to get back in line with the last two cycles guess what alts can go back down to their lows or they can put in new lows because they're not that far off of their lows to begin with whereas Bitcoin is right you know Bitcoin is already well off its low whereas the alts a lot of them are not now some of them are but a lot of most of them are not really that far off of their low so I mean you know if you see a situation where Bitcoin just simply goes back to where it you know where it was in the last two cycles at this point that's how the altcoin market can put in you know a lot of alts can put in new lows even in the having year and we saw that happen last cycle as well and and I know there's always going to be some type of reason for it or justification or rationalization but that is just what I've seen you know cycle after cycle after cycle is that alts can get that bounce in the prehab year but inevitably as you get later on in the business cycle and we get you know as the Market is really starting to digest all those rate hikes and and the FED refusing to Pivot sufficiently that's where alts you know the order books are thin and that's where they just continue to slowly bleed uh not only on their USD pairs but also their Bitcoin Pairs and then my guess is that once you start getting multiple weekly closes by Bitcoin below its 20we moving average I think there's a good chance that at that point Bitcoin dominance has topped but between now and then I think that you're going to see it you're going to see Bitcoin USD sort of chop around in this range for a couple of months um and during that time I I think the Bitcoin dominance will go uh to 60% as eth Bitcoin goes to 003 to 04 and and all Bitcoin pairs go all the way back down from 0 42 to where they currently are down to about .25 best case scenario and that's if you want to say that they're oscillators right so back down to 0.25 or so so that is is really my view right now on the market um there are also sort of other views that you could look at that sort of revolve around if it wants to follow some of the prior you know the prior Trends with some major geopolitical events we did see Bitcoin over here you know put in some scary Wicks back in early 2022 um and then they still swept the local high after that so there is always a chance that something like that happens as well um so be ready for anything uh but I I do think that the market would greatly benefit from a a summer lull where it just kind of gets boring for a little while and all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out that's what I think would be the best case for the cryptoverse is a a summer where all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out because no one cares anymore you know all the hype is behind us and then then you start to see them find their true lows on their Bitcoin pairs you know for everyone who is who's laughed at the idea of the devaluation of all Bitcoin pairs they just put in a new low last week right they just put in a new new low last week so don't laugh at it I mean this is just what happened last cycle you know it's just exactly what happened and and if they do come back down here like over here then I I think there's no debating anymore that it it really is following sort of what 2019 was it's just that the reason why it was delayed until the having year was because rate Cuts occur potentially now in the having year as opposed to the preh having year like last cycle so to me it all looks like it's playing out in a very similar manner where all Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows just before rate Cuts arrive the onset of rate Cuts potentially as early as this summer should allow a Bitcoin pairs to bottom out and then a USD pairs can find whatever low they're going to find um based on how how low Bitcoin goes and then perhaps by the last rate cut uh then you start to see it go the other way the biggest Counterpoint to all these views is if it's a um you know if we just get some manic blowoff top or something this summer uh following some type of left translated cycle I mean you could have a left translated cycle where the top is is March right I mean that's what happened in the dot crash right I mean that the top was in March of the election year that's not really my base case though um but I I would say I would say that if you are to get a left translated cycle where Bitcoin just goes parabolic into all the um into all the bad news and everything then you know then that would sort of invalidate the views that I'm expressing um my base case though is that we are just simply repeating what we saw uh back over here and all Bitcoin pairs should come down as we get into this summer and and by you know maybe by June July something like that I I could see all Bitcoin pairs finally bottoming out not withstanding Maybe some future Bitcoin parabolic rally which we saw over here but that is is you know really my view on the market right now and we will see if it if it continues to pan out or not in the meantime bitcoin's at 64k um and we'll see if it if it goes to the 20we estimate in the next couple of weeks or if instead it first rallies back up to just above or just around its 8we moving average um uh first but either way I do think we are due for a test of the bullmark sport band here in the next you know month month and a half if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the crypts premium at intothe crypto.com we have tons of charts thousands of different charts for a lot of different cryptocurrencies if there's a lot of cryptocurrencies that you have that you wish I spoke about or you wish you could see the charts for those cryptocurrencies we have a lot of them on the website you know a lot of people call me a Bitcoin Maxi how many Bitcoin Maxis have website a website with thousands of charts for altcoins right so I I'm not I just I I'm I I put my maxi hat on when Bitcoin dominance is in a macro uptrend and I I don't really think you should blame me for that um but do check it out links in the description below that sale will end uh this weekend after the having so make sure you lock in the low rate between now and then and I will see you guys uh hopefully tonight for the uh for the live stream of the having which is only a few hours from now but I can't make any promises that I'll be there it's going to depend on on how some uh some of the family stuff goes but I will do my best to be there to live stream the having anyways I'll see you guys

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse I thought you know the having is is just under a day way um so why not why not do a live stream and and then talk about it trying to post this all right um so let me see if I can pull up a having countdown here's one so 23 hours 2 minutes uh looks like it'll be on April 20th uh just after um the turn of the day right so I mean if you're on eastern time in the states then it'll obviously be on April 19th if you are you know in Europe or something it'll be or Asia it'll be April 20th so I mean it really depends on on where you are uh as opposed to the date so I guess for some of us it'll be on April 19th for other people it'll be on April 20th I tend to just measure all these things by Bitcoin by UTC time you know weekly closes by the UTC time like we're looking at it Eastern right um so I mean I think it you know just saying April 20th is probably um the way to go but I'm sure some people will say April 19th especially because that's where it will happen in the um in the in the states so let's go over to to bitcoin it's currently just below 61k um I don't really have an agenda tonight to be completely honest I just thought hey why not throw in a live stream talk a little B about crypto uh you guys know my thoughts on the market obviously I've made those very clear um you know and I I do think that that gold breaking out and eth Bitcoin breaking down does have ramifications on the market and and if you look at at what has happened to altcoins ever since eth Bitcoin broke down they just can't they can't really catch a bit against Bitcoin and they just keep keep on bleeding right they just keep on bleeding uh bitcoin's kind of staying the same so far but the altcoins kind of just keep on going lower and and this is exactly what we saw just before rate Cuts last cycle as well um and so what you would look for when you do get volatile moves by Bitcoin whether to the upside or the downside it should be fairly detrimental to the altcoin market so if Bitcoin were to you know to Rally back up to the 8we SM then I imagine it would break alts down on their Bitcoin pairs if it were to drop to the bull Mark support band and then bounce or something I imagine it would break all Bitcoin pairs down as well and so that's kind of the you know sort of the The Dilemma that that altcoins find their find themselves in at the moment um but I I also think it's important to remind ourselves that even when you're in larger Trends um there can of course be counter Trend rallies right so you know even though I'm bullish on on bitcoin dominance like I have been for like two and a half years it doesn't mean you're not going to occasionally get pullbacks along the way we did see a pretty big pullback by dominance right after the spot ETF um I'm not really convinced that we have to have a big pullback by Bitcoin dominance after the having but if it does happen just know that the trend is likely still intact uh and it's so far Bitcoin dominance has been doing a really great job of just holding 55% I mean I've actually been pleasantly surprised that it's been able to it and um I I I assume it will continue to go higher as the months um continue to sort of pass Us by but let's go through if you guys have any questions we will um talk about them and Ivan says how are you doing fine at the moment um we got a lot of comments up here yeah 24 hours to go uh no I'm not going to be doing a 24-hour stream dream uh no I I won't be able to do that um I will have uh other duties to attend to I do have four young kids um so I'm not gonna I'm not going to do a 24-hour stream but maybe if I were in college I would have so hopefully there's someone out there uh that's doing the 24hour stream but it's not GNA be me um someone says Emily says hello from Central California uh hello I was actually looking at um uh the YouTube stats recently and I was looking at let me see if I can pull this up analytics audience where is it right here it is okay so here is the let me actually go to Lifetime so if you look at my lifetime and analytics uh based on age and gender you can see that 94.4% are male only 5.5% female um and statistically most of you are between the ages of 25 to 44 so if you're a male between the ages of 25 to 44 then there's you're not alone there's a lot of other other people that are that same demographic as well but it does you know it does really make you wonder like how do you actually get more uh women in crypto right I mean I have to imagine that that one thing that would be helpful would be for all the uh the the Relentless meme coin Shilling if I think that is probably not the way to to reach a lot of a lot of people but um we'll we'll see I have received some messages about that you know I think a lot of people would just prefer like you know not the whole crazy open mouth thumbnails and all that kind of stuff but but something a little bit more um realistic but yeah I mean it's interesting um and and of course most of you are at least I guess the third of Year from the United States and about 9.5 from the UK five and a half from Australia 5.4 from Canada and 4.3% from the uh Netherlands so Netherlands is representing some there um let's go back over to bitcoin we're we're currently around 61k um someone says uh why are we dumping you know I've talked a lot about how you know I mean look guys you there could always be a a bounce after the having or something but you know there is a lot to be said in terms of um you know just kind of being ahead of where we normally are at this point in the cycle and I again I know it's not cool to point that stuff out but know we saw the same thing happened last cycle we got really far ahead and then we we basically spent 9 months cooling off to get back in l so I don't know if that's going to happen again um it probably depends on on you know monetary policy as well but just something to keep in mind right something to just like kind of keep in the back of your head that that could play out and it wouldn't necessarily mean anything um same thing happened last cycle I think that you know when you get into a period where it's essentially up only for a while um any type of move to the downside just seems like unbearable but I mean you can see where we are um at this point in the last two cycles we were still 50 to 60% below the all-time highs so um it's it's not I mean it's not that crazy diminishing returns I do think we'll have diminishing returns again this cycle um you know whether it's a left translated cycle Peak or not uh whether you get a peak in 2025 or 2024 um yeah I mean just depends on on a lot of different things and how how everything uh plays out check markets gold oil pumping hard on the war news um yeah I mean Gold's now at 2400 but I I would say I mean you know there gold has has been building up to this for a long time and and now it's broken out so yeah yes of course we're going to find reasons I mean you know back in 2022 when you had the whole like you know Russia Ukraine situation we saw gold go up and and we that's still ongoing by the way and it still came back down right um so you know I mean you have to think about that too right like that is is something to consider because um yeah I mean like if it if if we were just going down here we'd find a narrative to support it so yes I mean you can we can always say there's a reason for it but there's also been um stuff like that in the past and you know but I think you know we saw gold building up here it made sense for it to break out I've said for a long time it's going to break out and when it does it's a risk-off signal for the cryptoverse and you know that was met with a lot of uh criticism of course but here we are and gold broke out e Bitcoin broke down and the cryptoverse is is stuck in traffic on struggle Street right now uh thanks for all the content knowled J sure um someone says green candle in today April 20th my my guess there's GNA be a lot of volatility tomorrow which probably means we're not going to do anything but if I had to guess I would say there's going to be a lot of volatility tomorrow um as the having I I guess the issue is that really it would be on Saturday if it's UTC time so technically it wouldn't even be tomorrow because you know it' be on Saturday UTC but I I suspect that you know going into the having and just after the having there's going to be a lot of volatility um and you know you could make a case either way um you know you know if you look at the first if you look at other local tops and you kind of see like what happened going into them um and and by the way I mean it could be more significant than just a local top I mean I I don't want to imply that it can't be it it very well could be and I I've said before that it could very well be something like that um but you know in a lot of these times like kind of we've seen the market just sort of slowly bleed back down at these tops you got these rallies back up to the 8we SMA after getting a few week moov to the downside but in 2020 late 2021 we basically just went back down um you know pretty far in fact kind of back down to this level here which is where this base would be and that's that's pretty that's pretty far down so I really don't know I mean I really don't know which way it's going to break but um I I hopefully hopefully you have a plan you know hopefully you have a plan uh to navigate it um my my guess is whatever happens all Bitcoin pairs are going to are going to go down a lot is is what I would suspect over the next couple of months can I talk a little bit about Bitcoin duts um I mean you guys know my my thoughts I'm guessing you're being sarcastic but I I I just suspect it's going to go to 60% this summer that's my view I just think 60% is likely going to happen this summer and and I I just hope people are prepared for it um I I feel like I've done the best I can to try to prepare people I think too like at this point I've either sold you on the idea or I haven't and so it almost seems like like kind of useless to make you know keep making one hour long dominance videos it's like you either buy it or you don't right you either buy the idea or you don't and at this point you know with it being at 55% 55 and a half percent and already went to 57% you know I I do think it could top out right in the 60s not too far from here and so you have to be I have to be careful because I don't want everyone to you know finally believe it R when it actually finally hits the top I mean I this is why I've been bullish on dominance since 38% um I do think you know a good part of the move is behind us for dominance but I I still think there's a little bit more to go in it so yeah I mean we'll see we'll see what happens um in the next couple of weeks for Bitcoin uh whether it gets the move back to the 8-week estimate or not again example here where you go back up to it example here um in 2019 where where you go back up to it you above it right above it in those two cases and then an example here where you you went back up to it but it it took it a little bit longer right I mean like you know we we had a little bit of pullback and then the third candle here which is the one we're currently in was a pretty big move to the downside where it actually you know went down to that Wick right there right it went down pretty far so you know whatever happens my guess is sometime in May um you you know you or maybe June but you would get back up and it could even be like the next couple of weeks if it if it resolves like this right here but even that could still end up being May um that you go back up to the8 week but again you know if it if you get a larger move down first that move back up to the 8 week might not be as impressive because in the eight-week estimate would have come down quite a bit yeah I I know I'm not really looking at the news but I I don't really talk about the news on here but um yeah I don't know I mean I I will leave the news to you guys what's a good question to ask I don't know someone says once the Bitcoin race becomes the space race of the sah alts will a blip in the history in the history books I do think that like you can make money on alts because there is alt season like once every four years or so but I I think it is true that most alts will just bleed back to bitcoin over the longer Hall and so you are better off just kind of if you are in the altcoin market occasionally taking profits back to bitcoin just so you lock those profits in um if you're if bitcoin's sort of your unit of account right so you know if you don't really want to use the US dollar as your unit of account and you just want to treat one Bitcoin as one Bitcoin and say I don't really care what USD valuation is worth because even if it goes down it'll probably recover eventually then yeah I mean like I I I do think it makes sense to to value your portfolio in SATs and not US Dollars and I know like when you're going through your first cycle that seems insane right I mean like it seems insane but by your second cycle and your third cycle you really start to understand like why you you value your portfolio and Satoshi over over you know US dollars because it's all about preserving the Satoshi valuation of your portfolio and a lot of those all just go to zero um again like some of them won't I mean some of them will will likely you know survive obviously I think ethereum Will Will Survive but you really have to be careful I mean you do and I I know like people are like well whatever but you know you find yourself again where a lot of the alts are are not even really that far off of I mean they're just putting in new lows against Bitcoin right I mean a lot of these alts are putting in new lows against Bitcoin and so um there really wasn't a great time to be in that altcoin over the last three years right I mean like look at eth Bitcoin it's been in a downtrend since December of 2021 right I mean there hasn't really been a great period to buy eth over Bitcoin and hold it for a year you know I mean or for a couple years maybe if you cherry pick this low here you could find an instance but I mean for the most part it's just been bleeding um the same goes with with a lot of with a lot of all coins so you have to be I mean you certainly have to be careful with them someone says hello from Singapore can you talk about alt season in 2017 and monetary policy at the time well in 2017 the FED had been raising rates for a little while but the main difference is that rates were relatively low right so it's not like it was a super aggressive rate hiking cycle like we've seen this time um I mean a lot of these bull markets are basically just the market kind of like adjusting to higher interest rates and seeing if it can handle it and when it does the market goes higher and then eventually it can't and then and then the market caves but yeah I mean you had an altseason um you know over here I mean rates were really low they were only like one and a half percent so technically they were going up but they weren't really that High I mean you know the cost of capital was still relatively cheap and so that's why I mean I I I don't think it it it was as bad but once you got you know to to one and a half 2% then you can see what what ultimately happened to the crypto Market it's more like the rate of change I think than anything else this is a pretty big rate of change but um please talk about a scenario where the FED doesn't cut rates until 2025 so I do think they will cut to be clear but the market is saying only one cut in 2024 and then one cut all the way out till April of 2025 that's what the market thinks right now my suspicion as I've said is that the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in um because once and the reason if you think about it like why that would be the case if you if you see rate Cuts get priced out then businesses are starting to actually going to believe that the FED means what they say and they're going to go higher for longer if businesses believe it then they're going to change their spending you know they the type of spending they're going to cut costs they're going to lay people off right if they just think that rate cuts are just not really ever going to come anytime soon and so just the market believing that rate cuts are not coming will probably cause them to to actually come quicker um on a day like today obviously a lot of people think there's only going to be one cut this year I suspect you could get multiple Cuts this year and I think it's possible to get a cut this summer you know um so yeah I do think that it is possible even though I know the market is not really calling for a cut until um September at the current time someone says hello from Tasmania wow they going from uh California do I think salana will overtake eth uh no I don't um if you look at the sole eth valuation I mean it it it sort of looks like it's you know at the top of the range here right if it's an oscillator um so so these are these are sort of natural questions that come up about altcoins when they've rallied against eth or Bitcoin for a while is you know do you think you're going to overtake them a lot of times those questions come up at range highs right so um just the fact that you're asking that you know and I know I know I've looked at the soulle E valuation for a while here um but you have to be careful with that sort of stuff because a lot of people will think that especially when you're near the range Heights and then and then it just ends up being no different than than before someone says TLT spiked um yeah so so so bonds are a way to hedge uh certainly if you if you want to be um if you want to hedge it is in fact dubious speculation can I talk about plan B's prediction um yeah I mean I I really don't think bitcoin's going to go to 300K um I I do think eventually it will but I don't I don't think it's going to go there this cycle um I mean we we we basically had the same disagreement last cycle too I mean like I I was um more conservative he was more optimistic um but with that said you know I I also would argue that he's had a lot of great predictions a lot of things have worked out so just because I don't agree with it doesn't mean it's not going to happen I just think that you're you're you're probably not going to go to 300K that would be basically like a 5x from Peak to Peak and last cycle we only did like a three you know a three and a half X from Peak to Peak so I just I I don't think you're going to see that happen this cycle but I do think it is I think it's attainable in future Cycles um but I I don't think it's going to happen this cycle someone says they're female I got into crypto because I wanted to learn about it now as compared to when I made you with diena no I think it's great to learn about I mean I think it's great to learn about oh we got someone from Brazil someone says I think that women are by Nature more risk averse yeah I feel like a lot of times yeah like the um you'll see more guys take on a lot more risk and and you know like sometimes it works and then sometimes it really doesn't work trying to find more questions but you guys are all just saying the same thing you're talking about geopolitical stuff which I don't really want to get into um and I think the issue is that you know we always find a reason you know we always find a reason but um I mean remember I mean like eth eth saw a top before the merge a month before the merge and the reason why I've said before that we have to be careful with this one was because it was a month before the having and also um you know this FIB retracement kind of shows that would be an area that would be potentially difficult to get through and it it is proving difficult to get through right and if you look at this you know we're sort\n",

      "The existing summary is: The transcript discusses the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which is set to occur in around 24 hours. The host expresses uncertainty about the market's reaction, noting that there could be significant volatility around the event. He suggests that the altcoin market may suffer if Bitcoin either rallies or drops significantly, as altcoins tend to bleed against Bitcoin during such periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The host also discusses Bitcoin dominance, stating that he has been bullish on it for over 2.5 years and believes it could reach 60% this summer. He cautions viewers to be prepared for this, as it would likely be detrimental to the altcoin market. The host also notes that the demographics of his audience are predominantly male, between the ages of 25-44, and mostly from the United States, UK, Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands.\n",

      "Regarding the current market conditions, the host acknowledges that Bitcoin is trading just below $61,000 and that gold has broken out, which he sees as a risk-off signal for the crypto market. He suggests that the altcoin market has been struggling, with many altcoins hitting new lows against Bitcoin. The host believes that this is similar to what was observed before the previous rate cuts, where altcoins struggled as Bitcoin either rallied or dropped.\n",

      "The host also discusses the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, stating that he believes they may do so sooner than the market currently expects, as the pricing out of rate cuts could cause them to be priced back in.

      "we always find a reason you know we always find a reason but um I mean remember I mean like eth eth saw a top before the merge a month before the merge and the reason why I've said before that we have to be careful with this one was because it was a month before the having and also um you know this FIB retracement kind of shows that would be an area that would be potentially difficult to get through and it it is proving difficult to get through right and if you look at this you know we're sort of falling below the below the 3618 the 2618 is all the way down to like 47k right I mean that that would actually be below the bull market support band um so if you were to go there it would basically be sort of a crash below the 20we SMA um I I don't know if that's going to happen or not I mean I I do suspect that Bitcoin will go below the 20we ese this year but I don't know if it's going to happen like immediately or if it's going to be like a 2019 style thing where we chop around for a few months and then go below it someone says diminished interest it's really interesting because think about this guys we are a day away from the having and the social risk is 0.1 no one cares like like no one cares and that's why I I think we're more similar to this phase before rate Cuts than we are to sort of this uptrend over here where we're putting in higher lows the social risk just put in a lower low which is more similar to what we saw back over here in kind of the 2019 phase so I think that is ultimately where we are right now in the cycle is just before those rate Cuts arrive and and people are losing interest not because they don't like crypto but it's just that they're struggling right they're struggling with uh with with with finances maybe they're worried about their job you know inflation is brutal and this is why if you look at prior Market Cycles with you know traditional markets this is why inflationary periods are just so brutal in the markets because because you know the consumer struggles with all these higher prices for everything they have less disposable income but you know I kind of just think we're in this phase right here where social interest is just really really low um and could stay that way I mean honestly it could stay that way for you know the rest of the year frankly at least through the summer but yeah I wouldn't be surprised to see it the social risk you know stay in the in this lower area for a few months maybe bounce back and forth a little bit but um I wouldn't be surprised to see that but you're right I mean the social interest is is really has really Fallen um even though the having is only one day away if you look at YouTube views for a lot of these different crypto YouTube channels um you know they were basically at two million just a month ago month and a half ago and now they're down to one million across all these different crypto YouTube channels so definitely a lot of interest has been lost in the crypto verus recently which again is why as social interest goes down Bitcoin dominance goes up right we've talked about that a lot um and you can see it right I mean here's Bitcoin dominance without Stables as social interest goes down Bitcoin dominance goes up because if if you need if you want to see altseason you need a lot of new retail investors coming into the space to frankly buy your bags right but if they're not coming into the space and there's just not a lot of interest then the altcoin market keeps on bleeding against Bitcoin when Bitcoin dominance tops out what do you chart your alts against I think it still makes sense to chart them against Bitcoin if you want to chart them against eth as well I think that makes sense I wouldn't Char them against really anything else uh not like you know not Ono I mean I think Bitcoin and E make the most amount of sense if you want to compare altcoin valuations to other altcoin valuations you can do that but I I don't think it's as relevant gold running at this particular time versus Bitcoin is undeniably about look I I think it really is what we saw like last cycle it's you know gold broke out and and when it breaks out risk assets falter was the same thing you know it's the same it's legitimately the same thing we saw last cycle and I just feel like so many people don't want to believe it because of the having but what about the merge with eth I mean everyone told me after the merge eth Bitcoin was going to go up and look it it has only gone down as we said it was likely going to do um you have to be careful you have to be careful with the narratives it's more so what are the charts saying and what the charts are saying is that gold is broken out and that eth Bitcoin is broken down and I said for years that when e Bitcoin breaks down that's when the cryptoverse will struggle because it will represent a source of liquidity drying up right and now now that you got your first weekly close below the the the range low there you can kind of see just how how much the altcoin market has struggled on their on their Bitcoin pairs someone says the Head and Shoulder Target on gold as likely is 2500 I don't know anything think about the uh the whole inverse head and should I've said before I think we should leave The Head and Shoulder stuff to shampoo companies but I think that you know 2500 is is definitely a realistic Target I wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback from there but it's one of those things where like you know you spend three years waiting for it to break out and then it breaks out and then everyone's waiting for the pullback and you just don't get one right so I I do think if there is a pullback by gold then it probably would just be a um you know an opportunity do you think it's going to go higher for several years like it's not you know when gold breaks out it doesn't just break out um and then in the move immediately it usually breaks out and and has a a pretty impressive move that that lasts for a while so my guess this is going to last for a while um you can still get pullbacks like this like happened after it broke out in 2008 um where it broke out and then it actually had a pretty massive pullback but even in that situation it was a lot quicker to recover than you know than than risk ass that's it was a hedge right it's a hedge someone says when is a good time to accumulate alts um I I I I I mean look it's up to you it's really up to you I I don't think alts Mak sense because I just think dominance of bitcoin's going to go up you know so if you want exposure to crypto I think you're better off with Bitcoin uh with that said Bitcoin risk is still relatively high right now um as I mentioned I try to be as transparent as possible uh with with Bitcoin and what I'm doing um maybe not as possible because I mean I do Focus some of that on ITC premium but if you look at the risk levels you know as you go up the risk levels I I think the idea is as I've said to dynamically DCA out because you never really know um where the Top's going to be the local top you don't know if you're going to go to the highest risk band or if you're going to top out somewhere in between so by taking some profits along the way it it tends to work out um that way you know you take some off the table in case the market nukes uh but you still have some in case you know in case the market keeps going up so far we've seen a lot of like 20 to 22% Corrections over the last year and a half or so so far this is about 18 and a half percent so a 20% correction would put it around 59k a 22% correction we put around 57k so that would be an important level to watch the reaction from because if it reacts like it normally does from that level then you would expect at least some type of relief if you don't get a reaction from that level then it might mean the market is changing remember remember it was actually when all Bitcoin pairs broke down and E Bitcoin broke down over here that Bitcoin finally got a larger correction um right now while eth Bitcoin broke down alt Bitcoin pairs haven't broken down but they can also break down very quickly we saw how much they Wicked in just a single day not too long ago so I mean you know you could find yourself tomorrow where all Bitcoin pairs are are below 04 um so it certainly is possible and I I really do hope my my my goal my focus has been to help people realize that alts are incredibly risky and and and you know Bitcoin exposure can give you exposure to the upside but if if Bitcoin drops 30 40% the altcoin market gets annihilated um and if the altcoin market doesn't get annihilated it's only because Bitcoin went up right so if you just I mean bitcoin's kind of gives you that exposure um I also think having some cash can make some sense here as I've noted especially if you dynamically DCA sold in the point 7 a point8 wristband um but you know you know I'm not asking you to like go sell everything or anything like that I just think that you know you want to make sure you manage your risk um you want to make sure you're preserving the Satoshi valuation of your portfolio and the way that you do that is by not being needy in the altcoin market when you're on the verge of rate Cuts because when the verge of rate Cuts happened last cycle we saw after eth Bitcoin broke down I put about a tweet about this and I did a whole video on it right I said last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down the altcoin market dropped like 70% now maybe this time is different but I'm just telling you that was my experience last cycle right my experience last cycle was eth Bitcoin broke down and then alts basically just slowly bled for like nine months six to nine months right if you exclude the pandemic six months right it was brutal right it was just brutal because it was like there was no end in sight it felt like it was never going to end um I mean you can see a lot of these alts are are are you know just sort of slowly leading back to bitcoin so that was kind of the sort of the purpose of all these dominance videos to help people recognize that that Bitcoin uh does provide relative safety over altcoins um and that even you know if Bitcoin were to get a big drop from here it's still well off the lows whereas the altcoin market really isn't that far off the lows you know I mean like it's really not you know in fact most of them didn't even put in new all-time highs even salana which rallied a lot didn't put in new all-time highs card is nowhere close xrp do I mean a lot of these coins are nowhere close to their all-time high so if Bitcoin gets a correction where do you think the altcoin goes right I mean it potentially goes to a lower low that's what happened last cycle I know people just blame it on on everything but we always find an excuse every cycle for why it happened um and so I I think that just kind of sticking you know with a certain strategy for me it's just been Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio and then have some cash and fixed income accounts earning interest and then use that to navigate crypto right so if you get dips you can use um you know if you get big drops back to below 04 risk or whatever your risk tolerance is my risk tolerance is 04 but if you get big drops to your risk levels that you're comfortable buying at then you have some cash you have some cash flow to take advantage of that uh but you also have Bitcoin to give you exposure to the upside I mean even even here bitcoin's up 4X off the lows how did I get the conviction for your calls in the face of haters I I think it was I mean with with with all it was just like I've seen it before like I I remember last cycle dcing altcoins like from Q3 of the bare Market year through the H through the early part of the having year and then most altcoins put in new lows in the having year and I was just like hell I could have just stuck with Bitcoin that whole time and been so much better better off you know so I was like next cycle I'm going to do it differently after the top is in I'm just going to preach the good talk about Bitcoin dominance and get people to realize that altcoins are really you know alt season only comes after we go back to you know a lot looser monetary policy and QE right that's when alt season comes back and ALT season comes back when the haters give up right that's when it comes back know you can you call It All season all you want to I don't really care what you call it but you know as far as I'm concerned you know look at the chart you know show me where alt season was over the last three years you know and in the Bitcoin dominance St show me where all season was I don't see it I mean is this is this your all season right I mean is that is that your All Season no these are all seasons right that's what you're looking for we're not there right we're not there the only way you get to all season is for dominance to go higher first right and then once it's higher and all the Deens give up then you get all season but as long as the Deens don't give up guess what they keep on spending you know like crazy and inflation is still an issue and the FED has to go higher for longer right once you break the animal spirits inflation finally comes back down the FED pivots and then Bitcoin dominance goes down but I just I don't think we're there yet right I don't I I think that Bitcoin dominance is going to go to 60% where is the 8we I think it's at like 67 um but I mean it's going to move down quickly because the the price is going down quickly so I mean like you know it's at like 66.8k right now but you know I mean because that the price of Bitcoin has moved down so much in a very short period of time you will see it sort of roll over in the coming weeks and start to back down unless we go right back up someone says they need a Bitcoin only portfolio tracker you know there there's a lot of the portfolio trackers if you look will have a little button that you can click that'll convert it from usdt or USD to to bitcoin right so there are a lot of trackers that do that you just have to maybe hit the toggle the button that has your USD valuation of your portfolio if you click it um some of them have the option to view it on on your Bitcoin valuation and some even have it so you can view it as your eth valuation um so maybe maybe the portfolio tracker that you use already has that feature and you're just not aware of it because plenty of them have the feature if you're using one that doesn't have the feature then uh I don't know what that portfolio tracker is doing but they need to start implementing it after the having what is the narrative I think the narrative after the having is just win rate Cuts is I think that's the H I think that's the narrative it's just the market screaming at the FED to give us rate Cuts is is what I would guess the next narrative is going to be fed said no maybe no rate Heights until 2025 yeah again I I I think the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in so because because the consumer gives up the you know the the businesses give up I think them saying that and the market finally believ leing higher for longer means that it's started it's it's probably time to start fading higher for longer I've been a big proponent of higher for longer forever you know I was in 2022 I said we're likely going to go five and a half percent for the terminal rate and most people were saying we weren't going to go past three and a half percent but now that we're at five and a half percent and we've been here for you know nine months or so remember the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and we're already beyond that I think that in the same way the market underestimated how High the terminal rate was going to be I think they're underestimating the number of rate Cuts we're going to get over the next year they're currently only pricing in two rate Cuts over the next year that's an issue right that's an issue and you can see what's happening markets are are rolling over and it's not just crypto you know you can see a lot of uh a lot of um equities rolling over too so you know I think it's a problem when all these rate cuts a lot of these rate Cuts get priced out and it's because they're getting priced out which my guess in not too long from now we're going to see a lot of them get priced back in so I would fade this honestly I would fade this I mean it could mean a lot of different things it could mean locking in you know certain uh fixed income type stuff it could mean getting some Hedges as I've said before like gold and and and and bonds um but I mean you know with with things like bonds I mean they can still go down if if um if we keep getting in you know hot inflation prints it's not like they have to have bottomed already it's possible they have but it's not it's not like they have to um and and also my guess is that this summer if Bitcoin dominance is at 60% I I think a lot of people will start to call for it to go much higher but if if we're getting rate Cuts uh this summer then you know might not go much higher after that right I mean what would be the that would be the perfect narrative for people to say oh well you know you're never gonna have an allseason again because of of um you know everything's just going to go into the spot ETF but I I do think what we first 60% then we talk that's kind of where I am 60% dominance then we talk someone says that's a nice white T-shirt uh this is the uh the dubious speculation t-shirt we have them in the store stored out into the cryptoverse decom I have no clue in hell why you would buy one uh but if you need a shirt you can go buy one is the cryptoverse still on discount yeah just for the next day after the having we're going to raise the prices of ITC premium so you can lock in the price between now and then if you want lower price they're going to go up quite a bit if e Bitcoin continues to fall into June as you predict well you didn't start buying alts or stay Bitcoin heavy until Qi so here's the issue with it is that alt Bitcoin pairs bottom before alt USD pairs if you have a problem with that statement look at what happened last cycle okay alt Bitcoin pairs bottom before alt USD pairs so in order to figure out when all USD pairs bottom first all all Bitcoin pairs generally have to bottom now that doesn't mean that all altcoins have to put in new lows but you know in terms of building off of a low that can then start durly outperforming Bitcoin first all Bitcoin pairs bottom then alt USD pairs bottom so I think after all Bitcoin pairs find their low then you have to wait a while after that for all USD pairs to find their low um so you know I don't you know if you convert Bitcoin to altcoins you know when Bitcoin dominance tops you might be preserving the satos valuation of your portfolio if Bitcoin dominance is topping out but then the issue could be that your USD valuation of your portfolio is going down because while all Bitcoin pairs might be going up they might be going down on their USD pairs because bitcoin's going down right so the altcoin market is really a slave to bitcoin during this phase of the cycle and that's why I've said forever right just have Bitcoin if you want exposure to crypto because you know I mean you know if Bitcoin goes up it's going to go up more than Al and if it goes down it's going to go down less than alts generally speaking some are going to break that rule but generally speaking um and as far as eth I I've said before I do think it's going to fall back through this wedge because that's exactly what it did last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down right we had this wedge and and it fell back through it as eth Bitcoin broke down and we just saw eth Bitcoin break down last week and it seems to me like you know it's falling it's potentially falling through this wedge right you can see right here it fell through the wedge after eth Bitcoin broke down here and then eth\n",

      "speaking um and as far as eth I I've said before I do think it's going to fall back through this wedge because that's exactly what it did last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down right we had this wedge and and it fell back through it as eth Bitcoin broke down and we just saw eth Bitcoin break down last week and it seems to me like you know it's falling it's potentially falling through this wedge right you can see right here it fell through the wedge after eth Bitcoin broke down here and then eth Bitcoin just broke down and it looks like ethusd is falling back through back to that wedge which is around 2200 or so um but you know my guess is that is that eus will you know will go go there this summer is my guess I mean if not sooner but I I do think that if you just look at last cycle I know everyone wants to compare this year to other having years but I'm telling you monetary policy plays a role and if you didn't believe me last year you should believe me this year because Bitcoin dominance kept going up you know most of the people that refuted the idea of monetary policy playing a big role thought the Bitcoin dominance had topped out they should go back to the drawing board now that Bitcoin dominance put in a higher high right it means they were wrong it means they were wrong so I I think it it makes sense to compare it to mon you know use monetary policy to guide the view of the uh of the cryptoverse someone says the S&P futures are under 5,000 um yeah looks like you're right it looks like we are at a that's a pretty big drop this week 40 uh 4970 how will Bitcoin cycle correspond to the S&P cycle if it is left translated um I mean I imagine if Bitcoin cycle is left translated then it probably means that the S&P is also uh topping out sooner as well um there's also a scenario where the tops already in I mean it's not necessarily you know something that I'm saying has to be the base case I think there's you know compelling reason to believe that if if the FED pivots later this year and they start printing again then we could go back up in 2025 but if they don't if they really don't cut rates until 2025 like you know one of the one of one of them said uh then you know there does exist that scenario that you have to that you have to consider right I mean you know I mean we've seen we've seen markets find local tops in election years in in in March of 2000 actually uh the S&P found a local top or a macro top for a while and um in the 70s it was in December and then in in the first in the first big inflationary cycle and then in the 1940s the uh the election near top occurred in the summer so there's a lot of different periods of high inflation um where the markets are just Manic and and inflation is running rampant where you do see some tops in in election years but also note that there is actually seasonal weakness in the S&P 500 around this time in election years right so it's not even it's not even clearcut uh if you were to look at say you know the S&P 500 um and you compare say 2024 with the average of election years I mean you can kind of see that it's actually still well above the average of where it normally is in election years right so I mean there's there's some seasonality you can see here a lot of times the S&P kind of goes below its yearly open on the average as you get out into the May time frame um or you know may to June time frame so that's pretty standard um I mean you can see just how more volatile this one has been than sort of the average if you look at 2020 obviously that was a crazy one to compare to um and I'm not asking you to you know put a lot of faith in that one but you know you can look at 2016 and see that this is this one is currently outperforming that one you can look at 2012 actually 2012 at this point was actually doing better than this year has been but you can also see that this is kind of the phase where it it it you know sort of fell back down until maybe like May June time frame uh you can look at 2008 obviously 2008 wasn't really a great year uh 2004 here's 2000 and so on and so forth do I think the Bitcoin having will slowly Drive price up I think we are really far ahead of schedule this cycle and I think we really need the market to cool off I think that would actually be really healthy if it could if it doesn't if if all the animal spirits continue to run wild then we probably um you know then you get a blowoff top that is you know uh left translated and can be really bad for the longer term um I I hope I hope the market cools off uh if like kind of like last cycle where all Bitcoin pairs have an opportunity to bottom out um but I just I don't I don't think they bottomed out yet I do think all Bitcoin pairs are going to go down do you think the Bitcoin will hit the middle or high into of the logiic aggression rainbow chart well we've already gone down two and a half log lines right I mean we already done it um so we've kind of already hit it I think we could hit it again maybe later the cycle kind of like we hit it a couple times last cycle but the two and a half log line rule has already been hit here can I explain what Bitcoin dominance is basically it's just the uh the you know the the market share of Bitcoin with respect to the entire asset class right so like if Bitcoin dominance is at 50% it means that bitcoin's market cap is half of the total market cap of the entire asset space of the entire asset class what all coins do I I haven't been buying alts I mean I I've said for a long time I I think uh you know Bitcoin makes more sense at this phase of the cycle if rate Cuts does Bitcoin go up or down it depends on why rate Cuts if you look at history there's examples where rate Cuts cause Asset Risk assets to go up and examples where risk assets go down and it's because it's why they're cutting if they're cutting to kind of get a head of any potential bad stuff then risk assets can go up in 2019 while Bitcoin went up when they cut rates um or sorry Bitcoin went down when they cut rates the S&P went up um but there are times in history where the S&P goes down when they cut rates if they're cutting rates because they get some type of really bad labor market print or something then they cut rates for the wrong you know because they waited too long and then the market goes down so it depends on why they cut there's not like a an answer that that is going to be fitting for you it's not like I can just unilaterally say that risk assets do X or Y when rate Cuts arrive it really depends on the specific situation because you can find examples of both if e Bitcoin falls into lower regression ban then ALS will fall um yeah someone says greetings from Mexico City someone from Brazil too if eth Bitcoin pair plays out as you were saying well all season come at all or it'll be a very shortlived all cycle so if it plays out like last cycle right which is a big F but if it does it means that the alt season that you're wanting is not coming this year if that if it plays out like last cycle if it doesn't play out like last cycle then maybe all maybe the alt season does come this year but if it plays out like last cycle where once rate Cuts arrive the market bleeds for like six to n months then it it means that um the market gets really boring you know and and then in 2025 maybe when everyone's given up then you get alt season um but yeah I mean I I I think it's possible that you still get alt season in terms of like Bitcoin dominance crashing but I don't think Bitcoin dominance is going to crash until you get until you see it at least at 60% and even then it's probably gota kind of move around you know from 60 to 61 or to 58 right it's got to bounce around for some months there before you see it come back down anyways oh I got someone from Africa how many to reach 800,000 subscribers that's a good question um let me go check I'm at 799,000 1857 subscribers so if 143 of you could hit that subscribe button I will be at 800,000 subscribers I would very much appreciate it uh if you could subscribe if you're not already Subs got someone from Argentina um so glad you finally can to out of Al in 2023 I was a late yeah no I mean look some alts did okay it's not like all alts have been terrible but most of them have just bled to bitcoin right and you know I think that the the the collapse of eth Bitcoin is a really bad element for the altcoin market and I know it's easy to make fun of me for it and say you know you don't know what you're talking about but it's just what happened last cycle I I don't have to be right about it I could be wrong but it's just sort of a fair warning last cycle when e Bitcoin broke alts dropped 70% right that's what happened I didn't control it right that's just what happened um so I don't know like I don't know if they're going to do the same thing but I'm not putting my money I'm not risking my money on alts if you know during during during a do during a Bitcoin dominance rally uh you're free to risk your money on alts if you want to but I'm not going to risk my money on them um I've also missed out on some pretty cool gains in the altcoin market that's a fact too you know there's definitely some altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin um let's be real right I'm not trying to pretend like you know you know it was the perfect idea not to have any alls but I mean I'm just saying for me real relatively risk averse if you see a Bitcoin dominance rally coming from a mile away which is what I thought I saw and I was right like why would I go put a lot of money in alts if I just think Bitcoin dominance is going to go up right um just ride that Bitcoin dominance wave you know let the altcoin market bleed to bitcoin and then your purchasing power to buy Alt with Bitcoin goes up right even if Bitcoin goes back down like think about it like think about it like this today let's go maybe this is a great a good way to explain it so today if you look at one over eth Bitcoin one Bitcoin will get you about 21 eth right in in MA in in um December 2021 when Bitcoin got you about 11 e right if you had if you bought Bitcoin at the top in 2021 and R and rode through the highs and the lows the your USD valuation is essentially the same but guess what you can now buy twice as much eth with the Bitcoin that you have that's why Bitcoin dominance matters is because you took on less risk to hold a safer asset Bitcoin and now you can buy an altcoin for a lot cheaper and if Bitcoin were to go down to 50K or 40K even you know even if it goes lower right 30k in 2019 it first went to the 100 we SMA when rate Cuts arrived right I mean so I mean if it if it does that it could it could take a long time for us to get there but that's where it ultimately went you know I mean it went to the 100 we moving average um right now that 100 we SMA it happens to actually correspond to that breakout point right I mean it's kind of uh coincidental but that's actually what it corresponds to so you know if you get a situation where Bitcoin crashes Bitcoin dominance likely still goes up and so then like you might be upset that your Bitcoin USD valuation is down but then maybe your Bitcoin will then fetch you 30 e right you see what I'm saying it it really depend it comes back to whether you believe in the future of the cryptoverse right if you believe in the future your of the cryptoverse then you know for satoshi's sake value your portfolio in satoshi's if you don't believe in the future of the cryptoverse then fine value your portfolio in USD but don't come crying to me if your altcoin bleeds 90% against Bitcoin over the next 10 years or probably more the satos evaluation is what is important and you know it is you can laugh we but it is that that is what matters is sat valuation it shows you just how easy it is and it's not just you know look at look at Ada Bitcoin you know look at look at one over Ada Bitcoin in 2021 one Bitcoin would get you about 15,000 Ada today it gets you 141,000 Ada all you had to do was stick with Bitcoin once the FED made it clear they were going to be raising rates and going to quantitative tightening you didn't have to have any clue where the USD valuation is going to go by the way none of us have a clue you didn't have to have any clue where the USD valuation of Bitcoin is going to go all you had to say was look we're going into a high interest trade environment the fed's going to be reducing the size of their balance sheet Bitcoin is a safer asset there's going to be a hell of a lot of Regulation risk coming for the altcoin market so I'm just going to ride that Bitcoin dominance wave convert all to bitcoin and wait until the FED pivots that's all you had to do and then one Bitcoin over here got you 16 you know 14,000 or sorry 16,000 Ada today it gets you 141,000 Ada and I don't know I mean I don't know which alt coins are going to become relics but guess what if you held Ada all the way down then you're sure as hell invested and you hope it goes back to a new alltime high if you just converted your altcoins to Bitcoin in early 2022 when I said was the time to do it you have the luxury to just kind of come in at some point in the future and just kind of scoop up whatever altcoins you want at much cheaper Bitcoin valuations right that's why I say don't marry an altcoin right don't marry an altcoin there's only one year of the cycle where it really makes sense to to to to be heavier really heavy into alts there's really like one year of the cycle where that that makes sense you you spend one year Watching Bitcoin dominance go down and then then you spend like three years watching it go up right it's not that complicated guys it's really not in fact look at this chart if this chart I was looking at this earlier it should convince you well maybe not it's dubious but look at this chart six-month East Bitcoin candle right look at this and tell me tell me everyone on here is not just over complicating the Everlasting you know what out of it green red green red red red green red green red red red you know I mean what's so hard about that right this is what happened last cycle I don't know why people thought this time was different it's possible that eth Bitcoin Bottoms in Q2 or Q3 I said before it might bottom in June that's kind of like my base case right now is that it Bottoms in June but that's going to be predicated on the idea that the FED pivots this summer If the Fed doesn't pivot this summer I think they're making a bad a really bad mistake honestly and you know I do think there's a good chance we get a hard Landing but if they don't pivot this summer I I think a hard Landing is probably locked in um because the the consumer is is starting to falter here um just because you have some residual inflation based on lagging data uh it doesn't mean I mean it doesn't mean that the consumer is healthy right but I mean look at that look at the E Bitcoin six-month candles red green red or green red green red red red same thing green red green red red red I mean it's the same exact thing for anyone who cared to look at the damn chart you know but instead I spent the last two and a half years listening to the eth Maxis tell me how it was holding up well every step of the way down and now some of them are starting to capitulate and I'm telling you I'm telling you some of them I think are going to be capitulating into that 0.3 to 0.4 range and that could be the bottom right when they say all right Ben you were right like all right well now that you believe me it's time to go back the other way so you have to you have to be careful with this stuff it's playing out like like it played out last cycle for anyone who actually cares to look at the chart and and and they don't come on here here and tell me that you know I'm ignoring all these higher lows on the E Bitcoin pair because I'm not you know I'm not I I recognize there's higher lows on here but you know what else I recognize I recognize lower highs you know so don't don't just look at at at one of the charts look at all of them right I mean you can see that like however you want to draw this out there e Bitcoin is breaking down you know um and you have to be careful when that stuff happens and I mean you know I think it I think it's going to accelerate the breakdown into the summer months and then hopefully bottom out this summer just like it did on the similar time frame in the last cycle when you looked at those six-month candles someone says chain link early M last cycle the issue with chain link you know I I with the Bitcoin valuation look to see what it does here you know I drew this potentially out um a while back you know when it was back up here look to see if it holds here at um at 17700 STS that prior low sort of that back testing that that trend line if it can hold there then maybe you have something right if it can't then you're just it's a falling knife right see if it holds support I don't know if it's going to hold support a lot of these Els aren't holding support like Ada Bitcoin sure is H holding support dot Bitcoin I mean what is there to say right Litecoin Bitcoin as I said before what it does best is bleed against Bitcoin or Litecoin bleeds against it link Bitcoin just said madic Bitcoin I I think I think there's a good chance that madic Bitcoin will will bottom before eth Bitcoin um so if you see madic Bitcoin bottoming then it might mean eth is gonna bottom against Bitcoin but I don't there's not really a clear evidence yet that it's bottomed um I've said forever that once madic gets below a thousand stats you got to be on the lookout for it and it's already gone below a thousand so as it continues to bleed here look to see if it can form a low right that doesn't mean the USD valuation is done bleeding even when the madic Bitcoin low is in the madic USD valuation can go down after madic Bitcoin bottoms same thing for eth Bitcoin and ethusd and Ada Bitcoin and Ada USD and Bitcoin and USD right it's the same thing but either way I mean look you have two scenarios here right I mean the markets don't tend to go sideways for very long so it's either going to go up or it's going to go down my contention my contention is that if it goes up all Bitcoin Get Wrecked if it goes down all Bitcoin pairs Get Wrecked so Bitcoin dominance goes up no matter what right so that's why I've said you know rinse your hands of the altcoin market until lose for monetary policy AR that's been my view um admittedly whenever I whenever I get super vocal about it uh you know inevitably someone does it and then and then we get a bounce and they hate me for three months but um it's been my V for two and a half years you know if if it took you until now to to get on board with dominance train that's not my fault what's my long-term stance on E Bitcoin I don't really know I'd like to see if it can bottom at 03 to 04 someone says interesting that dominance isn't spiking as hard as a few days ago as when we hit 60k there's an interesting dominance chart and that's like dominance excluding Stables um and it's actually kind of doing what it did LA I mean it it it did something similar last cycle where it sort of swept the high and then cooled off for a little bit and then kept moving up I think it's going to move up it might it might cool off for a week or two but I I do think you know in May and June you should see the dominance a lot higher um especially you know especially as we get further out into the summer right like May June maybe even out to July I don't know I think the hard part is the dominance rally has taken a lot longer than I thought it was going to so I don't really want to limit it to May or June like it could rally until August or September for all I know um but I mean it it it really depends on on just how quickly it it takes things to you know to to to play out you know and I I don't know um if if if for instance right I mean like like like\n",

      "\n",
      "The host also discusses Bitcoin dominance, stating that he has been bullish on it for over 2.5 years and believes it could reach 60% this summer. He cautions viewers to be prepared for this, as it would likely be detrimental to the altcoin market. The host notes that the demographics of his audience are predominantly male, between the ages of 25-44, and mostly from the United States, UK, Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the current market conditions, the host acknowledges that Bitcoin is trading just below $61,000 and that gold has broken out, which he sees as a risk-off signal for the crypto market. He suggests that the altcoin market has been struggling, with many altcoins hitting new lows against Bitcoin. The host believes that this is similar to what was observed before the previous rate cuts, where altcoins struggled as Bitcoin either rallied or dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "The host also discusses the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, stating that he believes they may do so sooner than the market currently expects, as the pricing out of rate cuts could cause them to be priced back in. He suggests that businesses may change their spending behavior if they believe the Fed will keep rates higher for longer, which could ultimately lead to the Fed cutting rates sooner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The additional context provides further insights into the host's perspective on the current market dynamics. He emphasizes that altcoins tend to bleed against Bitcoin during periods of volatility, and that Bitcoin dominance is likely to continue rising, potentially reaching 60% this summer. The host cautions that this would be detrimental to the altcoin market, as the lack of new retail investors entering the space would lead to the altcoin market continuing to struggle against Bitcoin.\n",

      "The host also discusses the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, suggesting that the pricing out of rate cuts could lead to them being priced back in sooner than expected. He believes that this could cause businesses to change their spending behavior, ultimately leading the Fed to cut rates sooner than the market currently anticipates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the transcript maintains a cautious and somewhat bearish tone, with the host expressing concerns about the potential impact of the Bitcoin halving and the current market conditions on the altcoin market. He emphasizes the importance of having a plan to navigate the upcoming volatility and suggests that Bitcoin dominance may continue to rise, potentially to the detriment of altcoins.\n",

      "as we get further out into the summer right like May June maybe even out to July I don't know I think the hard part is the dominance rally has taken a lot longer than I thought it was going to so I don't really want to limit it to May or June like it could rally until August or September for all I know um but I mean it it it really depends on on just how quickly it it takes things to you know to to to play out you know and I I don't know um if if if for instance right I mean like like like let's suppose if e Bitcoin bounces after the having like it bounced after the spot ETF right you see after the spot ETF e Bitcoin got a bounce if it gets another bounce then I mean it essentially delays everything by like a month or two you know um so it kind of depends like I don't know if it's going to get that bounce after after the having um you can see that last cycle we we did get sort of a similar type of Bounce but eth Bitcoin hadn't actually broken the range lows on a weekly close whereas here it already has so you know I don't know you got s your one two three um one two three you can kind of see it's already breaking so I don't know if it's going to get that bounce at all anyways and the last time it didn't get a bounce um it didn't get that final bounce right it just broke through so there's definitely like evidence to suggest that it could go it could get a bounce but my base case is that is that um e Bitcoin bleeds you know my base case is I don't I'm not going to bother trying to predict every single low or high by the E Bitcoin pair I'm just going to say look I think it's going to go down if it goes up in a twoe time frame or something so what that doesn't change anything for me it doesn't move the needle um just like all these other lower highs didn't move the needle for me someone says you all expect a balance from 58 I don't know where did it go um how low did it go I mean it just went to 59 six um so I mean that so what is that what is that measured from the top so that's about a 19 so we've now gone 19% down a lot of those pullbacks before were about 20 to 22% so it's getting pretty close to that typical pullback if it's more than a 22% drop if it's like a 25 or 30% drop then you could still get a sizable rally off of that like 2019 but it it probably is even more definitive evidence that the local top is in right because that's what happened in 2019 is after e Bitcoin broke down um you finally had a 30% drop as opposed to just like a 10 to 15% drop um so if you get a larger drop then it you could still get a balance off of that level but it probably is kind of some evidence that whatever comes after is a lower high if you bounce it 20 to 22% down there's still a chance right there's still a chance that you know you could see another move up but even in that case you still have to watch that 8we moving average because that 8we SMA is is potentially we're potentially going to get a weekly close below it um and we've we've I mean I shouldn't have to explain why that's important we've talked about it for the last year uh but you know when that happens it can certainly mean the market is cooling off and and you can see that it really cooled off over here last summer as well as it went below the eight-week moving average same thing in 2021 both Peaks same thing in 2019 right once you get that Weekly close below the eight-week estima it doesn't mean you can't get another face ripping rally back up to a lower high but it does tend to mean that the party's going to be over um for at least a little while for someone who has a higher risk tolerance you think D saying Al now a bad play I think it makes sense to do what you're comfortable with I mean like I I don't think that like what I'm doing makes sense for everyone um I think it kind of depends on where you are in your own Journey you know I mean if you want to take on more risk who am I to tell you not to do it you know I mean there's been plenty of people that took on risk and made a lot of money so I I think you have to remember like what's right for me is not what's right for you do I see Bitcoin hitting higher highs before a summer slump um that's a good question I don't really know I mean you know with the spot ETF we you know the market wasn't really looking that great and then it it just spiked up and put in a new high right so like you know and then and then it and then it real you know radically sold off after it now of course we ended up going up a lot higher but um it it's really hard to say I mean I think that we're probably going to get to the point where you know everyone's gonna think at least that it's going to go to a new High um especially if you get some type of like rally like that off back up above the 8we estim like we saw in 2019 and 2021 I don't know I mean I I do think there is a case to be made the closer you get to May and stuff that um you're GNA see that summer lle come into play I'm not going to say it can't go put in a new High I mean I mean look at the wick into the spot ETF right look at that Wick right I mean if we replicate that then you know it's essentially a new high but I mean it's risky right it's risky to sort of bet stuff on that again I don't I don't base my investment strategy on whether I think Bitcoin is going to Wick back up to the highs or not like that's not something that I even care about um I don't really know I mean I I do think there there is some reasons to think that with eth Bitcoin breaking down and gold breaking out that it could turn into into something more but um that something more could still be one or two months away right where it you know like over here it after it fell below the 8 week and then still rallied back up for a few weeks and then it fell um in 2019 after it fell below the 8 week you know it still it still rallied back up for a few weeks and then it it still and then it finally fell it took a while right I mean it took a while and and you might get something like that right where it just takes a while if it plays out like late 2021 that would probably be the most brutal way uh to you know to potentially put in a local top is to just not even really get a relief rally and just kind of go straight back down um right after the Bitcoin having that would probably the most brutal way if that happens look to see what happens to all coin pairs under such an environment you can see that Bitcoin is is going down today it's down about three and a half% and dominance is up right I mean this is what I we've talked about forever right you know you get into the phase of the cycle where Bitcoin goes down and Bitcoin dominance goes up Jessica ask is it having the 19th or the 20th it depends on where you live um you know in the uh in the states it looks like it's going to be the 19th but if you're in Europe or something you know like UTC time you can see it's potentially going to be the 20th so if like you're in Europe or Asia or something it's going to be the 19th if you're in the states it's going to be the uh or sorry if you're in Europe or Asia it's going to be the 20th if you're in the states uh it's going to be or you know just on North America South America right it's going to be um uh April April 19th so it depends on where you live again guys make sure you subscribe if you're not subscribed uh we have I'm trying to get to 800,000 subscribers so it would in fact be nice to get there if you would not mind subscribing we actually just gained some so we are now at 799,000 so I just need 96 more people um so yeah um if you could subscribe that'd be great and also we do have the sale on ITC premium links in the description below that's going to end after the having so just fair warning um any other things should we wrap it up What If the Fed raises rates this year I don't really think they're going to raise rates I mean if they do I think that would be a really bad mistake I I don't think they're going too um but yeah if they raise rates it probably just makes Bitcoin dominance go even higher you know frankly um I don't think they're going to raise rates but yeah that's what it would mean could a rising alt pair on its total three valuation or could alt total three pairs on dayl an indication of future strength yeah if you if you're seeing an altcoin kind of like outperforming most other altcoins then it's probably an indication of future strength there's a good chance it is not necessarily but I mean like not set in stone but like I've seen that happen a lot of times where if an altcoin is showing relative strength in a dump then whenever you know whatever there's the next relief rally then it can it can outperform a lot of other alts in a in a pump huh how do I keep my ego in check after being right for so long guys the reality is that I have I mean I haven't been right about everything there's been so many things I get wrong and that's how I keep my ego in check is because the markets humble everyone um you know yes some some things I've been right about but also a lot of things I've been wrong about and and you know when you get things wrong it humbles you and um and the market humbles us all someone says they unsubbed and subbed again just for me I I appreciate that looking back should fed of raise rates a few I don't think so I think they're doing what they need to do I don't know if I'm going to go live in 20 hours I don't know I don't know I do think there's going to be a lot of volatility though I think it's going to be uh kind of crazy it might not be tomorrow because technically UTC time it's the it'll be the next day but you're probably going to see a lot of volatility going into the having so just be aware of that um yeah what does the extension from the 20we look like it's kind of funny I uh I put out a video about it um and it ended up doing the same thing that it always does and everyone over complicated it once again um which is kind of fascinating right it really is fascinating how like every single time it just does the same thing it always does you know um and every time no one wants to believe it right again the trend this trend line will eventually Break um because otherwise it just implies that Bitcoin will only ever go below its 20 week SMA and never get back above it um if it if you carry it out far enough So eventually this trend line will break but it hasn't broken yet and um I mean I do think it will break but not yet it hasn't broken yet is it just a coincidence that ta allines with macros current War scare I I think we find reasons for things um I think we we like to blame we like to like rationalize why things are happening that's my guess because like if imagine this like imagine if you had this like War thing you know like the whatever you know the current scare going on right now and if the markets were up 10% then everyone would just say oh they're up because it means that it means that we're going to start printing money to fight the war you know but if we're down then people are like oh it's down because you know everyone's scared because of the war right I mean whatever happen s you can find a narrative to to support that view right so like if tomorrow the price is up then people will say oh price is up on fears that the war is happening therefore the money you know people are the the central banks are going to start printing again um if the markets are down it'll just be markets tumble on you know worries about tensions across seats you know so I mean it it it it really does feel like we look for the reason to explain the price but really price leads the narrative The Narrative doesn't lead the price whatever the price does we'll figure out the narrative to go along with it um not the other way around um also the other thing too is once you hear about the news it's already been priced in because you know I know we all think we're special but you know there's there's going to be other people that get the news before we do and algorithms that can you know price that stuff in way before we can so by the time you see it it's already been priced in theoretically you know it's not like it's not like you're going to go read the news on some news outlet and then be able to like get an edge generally speaking right because if if you're reading it on a news Outlet then s have millions of other people so what Edge would you have actually after some of the last tensions and didn't we get a bounce where we swept the high in um in 2022 I think we did I mean it wasn't like we didn't sweep the the actual top but we swept that local high I think um because the uh Iran invaded Ukraine like right here right and you had a a long Wick down and and then the market rallied back up and it actually swept the highs so yeah I mean like it's certainly possible that something like that could happen I I'm not going to say it can't happen um I mean I don't know if this is exactly the same pattern or not yeah like if you take this and you just sort of overlay it to this one right I mean you can kind of see that the market ch around in this range and then It ultimately it kind of looks like it's deviating some though because it was like following it it bounced up it was following it and then and then the market rallied but then this time the market has kept going down but maybe because it's the whole retaliation stuff that hadn't been priced in yet um but I mean you can see that it it did go back up sweep the high right it swept the high and then it got a a a big pullback so imagine how hard that would be for Market participants if you go up and and you sweep the high and then you drop into the summer right and that's why I think it makes sense to just have a strategy either way I mean like try not to stress so much about it um just have a strategy and and and I I wouldn't like try to over complicate it I mean because you also might not get that I mean you might not see that same type of move and it could also be dependent on other things I mean like you know if if in May the unemployment rate comes in at 4% or something then you know maybe the markets go down right because they're like oh crap the labor market sucks now um but if you get a Lower Print at like 3.7 or something then maybe the market rallies back um and people use that as the reason someone says they're 90% down on their mcoins back I am sad to hear that uh if you're if you're telling the truth and hopefully you can maybe stay away from the mcoin market and focus on other things someone says if you're chasing new Cycles you will always lose I would agree with that I I think that yeah like the news isn't going to give you an edge on in the markets oh did I say Iran I meant um I me Russia yeah I'm thinking about the uh the current conflict and and and um and the and the one that's you know happened that sort of kicked off in 2022 so yeah I meant I meant um me Russia see I don't know we'll see we'll see if it uh what happens here if it sweeps the low and then if it if it moves back up up into the having or or what is the bmark support B8 WEA valid for total market cap chart I I imagine it would be something similar um I think it would be something similar so the 8we for total Market is at 2.43 trillion so for us to get a rally back up there it would from this level it would be about a 12% rally to get back up to the 8we estimate for total Market am I up to dat on the candidates tournament yeah there's a tie for first place with like what two games to go all right guys I think we're going to wrap it up uh thank you guys for tuning in again subscribe if you're not subscribed uh we are still looks like we're at 79,90 so I need

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse this is NFA live this should be a relatively exciting show for two reasons first of all we have the Bitcoin having coming up in just about a day and we also have a new guest with us today Max from because Bitcoin uh how you doing great thanks so much for having me Ben yeah and you started you started doing this a year or two ago is that right yeah probably about 18 months ago officially yep all right yeah so max is um I've known him basically since probably before he even started the YouTube channel or right around the time that he started it uh so make sure you guys go subscribe to him and Rob as well uh links to that are in the description below so make sure you guys check that out and we're just going to go through a lot of the different questions that I think would probably be on people's minds as we go into the having uh so let's just go ahead and jump in Rob we'll start with you on this one the having is tomorrow it's tomorrow we've been waiting forever here it is fourth having um and I'm guessing it's going to garnish some attention should be making some headlines different places I'm curious what what effects do you think the having will have on the larger crypto space um do you think it'll bring new eyes to the scene or are we still kind of just uh you know the same old same old people just kind of hanging out um do you think it'll it'll actually bring new new people to the space uh we saw a lot of new people come to the space last cycle sometime after the having um or do you think it'll be quiet for a while and do you see any narrative shifts after the Havoc that's a pretty loaded question first of all I would just like to say that Max has a great background I'm sure he got to the same place I did which is fivr and uh hopefully he didn't get ripped off but it looks great and uh I gotta tell you one of these days max we're gonna have to put that into an nft just me and you so yeah yes that is my old green screen but I'll be jumping in that green screen as soon as the uh as the Bitcoin hits 100K But to answer Ben's question which I think is is what uh everybody wants to really try to figure out is this Bitcoin having and I know like there's a lot of first of all that I still believe in the fouryear cycle some people say that it doesn't really register I still and some people will talk like Bob Lucas will say well it's just left translated and we're going to see a big blowoff top in 2024 which could very well happen but I still think that the narrative around it and there's still a lot of people say well there's Mass adoption coming and it's already here I still think it's I mean I don't think that we're at the same level like we should be and what we could be in like 2028 or 2032 or you know time comes up but Ben if you get to show my my screen real quick because everyone wants to know like well the Bitcoin having and you did a great I I watched your your video Ben about uh uh the ethereum evaluation ethereum ethereum valuation of Bitcoin about how you know Bitcoin dominance is going up and how it's wreaking havoc and it's true it is right now I know people will will also talk about you know like hey well you know these things happen leading up to the having but if we take a look back this is from Smart Valor it's a good website and if we take a look they did all the work for him which is great this is how Bitcoin behav in the year leading up to each having because we had one of course in 2012 2016 then 2020 and I know people will say well there's always a dip there's always this massive dip before the having and there could be I mean we saw one pretty massive one in 2020 but of course there's a reason for that and and we could either say like it's because of the of the almighty Corona virus or it was something else but yeah there was a dip in 2016 but again just take a look at this so with having with the having one in 2012 the year leading up to the having it went up to 385 per. and the year after of course because we always see alltime highs the year after so far it went up 5,000% having two in 2016 leading up to it 142% now there's dips along the way and we're seeing that right now but then a year after that in 2017 2 84% in 2020 even though there was a turbulent year like we talked about it was still up 17% for the year getting into that having in May I think it was May 12 2020 and then it went up almost five almost 600% the year after that and we can see here that that yeah same thing happened the year leading up to to the having on November 208th 2012 this is what Bitcoin was 250 and then of course we come up and then you can see right here that yes there is a a drop before that and then it comes up and there's a drop before but it's like the same thing as like a bull market so we're seeing the same thing kind of Replay I know it's a funny thing because like Ben you'll say like uh you say hey I I I told you that the Bitcoin ethereum evaluation was going to start to start to lose momentum or actually bleed away to ethereum and then people were going to blame a Black Swan event and they never would have saw it coming but here we are and again same thing happens here 2015 a year going into it yes it's not a straight line but we kind of I mean really rallied into it there's you know dips along the way but I mean it's going in that right direction and then of course 2019 to 2020 we started at 7325 we had it kind of flat and then we saw the almighty Corona virus right here but then we rallied into it so I still feel like the same thing's gonna Happ happen that's just how I see things and I'm I'm feeling pretty good about this having so far but the big question is and and we we'll talk about this later is what's the macro is there going to be quantitative easing or more quantitative Tiding are they actually going to cut rates are we going to have the liquidity that we absolutely need which we had beforehand even though we're in quantitative uh tightening right now I mean we still rallied pretty well but can we get that liquidity back in the market and that's I think that's the big question on top of the fact of are we going to see World War II so yeah that's where I got yeah it's interesting because you know at some point you would think we would need to make the shift from quantitative tightening to quantity to quantitative easing but what needs to trigger that shift is the is the is the thing that I I think we're kind of wrestling with um someone asked where a guy was I I should have mentioned that he's he's in Dubai and I mean there's obviously a lot of stuff going on right there going on right now there with the conference and um everything so he wasn't able to make it this week um so um Max I I'll put the same question to you I mean like what are your thoughts here on the Bitcoin having um is this just kind of the same old thing that we've seen before and everyone's trying to over complicate it uh do you see any kind of shifts coming after after the having what are your thoughts yeah I I would agree with the with the last part I think that a majority of people and it's very easy to do this I I tend to do it all the time is to sort of chronically over complicate something that has for over a decade now been a pretty reliable uh we'll just we'll call it a risk on event and in the simplest of terms all you need to do is you know pull up your trading view chart and Mark out every single Bitcoin having right you need at this point you know you need to draw four vertical lines whenever a Bitcoin having has occurred look at the the price action that has basically come almost immediately following so um you know I I try to look at this thing from Every Which angle you know I look at it from the side I look at it up side down I you know I try to include the macro and and fed policy in all of my decisionmaking but um you know the truth of the matter is this is a very unique time to be in the markets right Bitcoin is now on the global stage in my opinion for the first time um there is you know new on-ramps into crypto you know specifically being these you know nine ETFs um and it is you know there's more regulatory Clarity the accounting standards have shift did in a positive light and are working to you know become more friendly for corporations and big money to actually onboard into this digital commodity if they choose to do so um but again like Rob had mentioned and Ben like you commented on there also are some macro headwinds which can only be ignored for so long unfortunately I am of the belief that we do still have some time I believe we're maybe on borrowed time some people probably don't like to hear that but but I do believe that there is this this unique pocket of time where it's all coming together and we can really see risk perform um positively of course I don't have to tell you guys this and I probably don't have to tell the audience this but historically during a Fed pause until something has quote unquote kind of broken and we see Unemployment uh you know trending above 4% and the FED actually has to step in and begin easing through you know interest rate cuts and other measures um we can actually see risk you know being stocks and now crypto performed tremendously well and you know going back to you know to the last cycle you know we actually kind of went through a little mini fed cycle here and you know 2018 2019 and 2020 um you know where Bitcoin actually the floor kind of gave out we dropped to about 3K and then we had that famous rally into June of 2019 when we topped um you know there was actually hikes going into that and then of course right as Bitcoin basically topped in June of 2019 the FED began to actually cut rates um more or less right after that and it did dramatically affect Bitcoin some will say you know it was a reflexivity and you know we had to you know we we sprung hard off of that local floor so you know of course the market corrects to the downside some will say it's covid some will say it was in the charts the whole time some will say it's not I don't know you know nobody knows whether it would have happened with Co or or without um but again I don't think that this time really is that much different I think that every cycle has some distinct differences from from a previous one I mean for example last cycle we had a double top we haven't had a true double top before we have had a cycle like the 2013 one where we had you know two pronounced Peaks but a true double top had never happened before and additionally in the bare Market we had never spent as much time below the 200 WEA as we just did coming out of this most recent bear so there are you know of course Very recognizable and notable differences of every cycle but you to answer the question Point Blank I don't think that this time is much different and I I'm trying my best to not overthink it um and say you know what there is no reason for the FED to intervene at this point we're trending in that direction and we are on borrowed time there is a Day of Reckoning coming but I do believe at the earliest it's probably sometime in Q4 we have the having you know in less than two days and I do believe that there's plenty of room for risk to run in the short to Middle term maybe going out six months okay yeah no I mean it's great to get you guys opinions um and the market has been on an absolute tear I mean essentially after since October right I mean it was pretty boring summer last year but then since October uh the market has basically just been up only up until the last few weeks but um you know the next thing I'd like to talk about is of course Rob's absolutely favorite topic and it's of course Bitcoin dominance um and you know I you know you guys know My Views but I always like to get other other views because you know I'm I it's it's a good idea not to live in an echo chamber so Bitcoin dominance has once again broken a new highs I I we saw 57% actually it came really really quickly really quickly you know that that move to 57% it's kind of cooled off back you know it's back down to like the 55 like 55 and a half or so so it has cooled off quite a bit since that rally up to 57% uh so uh Max I'll start with you first on this one do you think it's going to keep going up after the having um you know it was it it was going up into the spot ETF and then it kind of waned a little bit following the spot ETF but then it just kind of picked right back up so what do you think is gonna happen this time and and this kind of goes to the whole like the last question as well like will there be a narrative shift and what people are focused on will they will they start focusing on more things besides you know sticking with Bitcoin um do you see you know what are your thoughts on that Max well first I have to give you a compliment Ben because you were one of the few people that with a big following publicly called Bitcoin dominance rallying to this point I didn't expect it to get up to I think it topped at what 57 recently or wherever did you you deserve a lot of credit for that well I'm known for riding Trends too long see well we'll see right nobody knows besides the market right like you know we we all have our our inclinations but uh you deserve a lot of credit because I remember months and months AG I don't it was probably six months ago plus we did a space together or you came on on my my channel because Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance was significantly lower and eth BTC was significantly higher and much has changed since then so kudos to you where do I think it goes from here so I think that Bitcoin dominance is in the process of we'll call it distribution okay I believe believe that the meat of the move is over um but that does not preclude it from going a little bit higher than here maybe maybe 60% that's not my base case but you know let's let's look left on the chart and you know use that to you know maybe forecast what could happen next so ignoring the you know whether this is a left translated cycle or an expedited cycle let's look at it contextually for where Bitcoin is at um you know from from a a p perspective right so Bitcoin actually has gone on to get above the previous cycle all-time high of 69k so most comparably again ignoring everything else but just pure levels on the chart pure you know where was the cycle High where was the cycle low you could probably compare Bitcoin right now to like December of 2020 okay if we just ignore everything else and say okay Bitcoin in December of 2020 went on to sweep the previous cycle all-time high of 197 it paused there for what maybe a month or or something like that it was chopping around altcoins got destroyed during that time right Bitcoin uncertainty like you always preach Ben uh when Bitcoin is uncertain alts get absolutely eviscerated and we are seeing that once again right so um again comparing this period of time to December of 2020 there is turbulence under the previous cycle all-time high which is not uncommon we saw that again last cycle and then also two cycles ago it seems to be sort of the same thing happening again what did we see in December of 2020 well what we saw was Bitcoin dominance basically put in a deviation or bull trap High where on when Bitcoin finally decided it was time to push through with conviction above the previous cycle all-time high of 197 you saw Bitcoin dominance put in an explosive move which ultimately ended up being sort of a bull trap you know for for the Bitcoin Maxis um so I I think it's possible we are seeing that Devi that deviation high right now only time will tell um I do have hedges in place you know like I'm I'm holding some Bitcoin l2s like STX and some Bitcoin ordinals and things like that that I think would be beneficiaries of you know Bitcoin dominance continued rally maybe above 60% um but of course you know I I really I am of the belief that contextually with Bitcoin chopping under the previous cycle all-time high seeing similar signs of Bitcoin dominance putting in you know this this last explosive push I do believe that over the next six months or so it would probably makes sense to see Bitcoin dominance Trend down dramatically and additionally and and I don't mean to you know bring this up because I don't know if this is on the agenda today exactly I imagine that that would translate to eth BTC finding a bottom sooner rather than later but that doesn't again preclude it from going down a little bit more and only time will tell yeah no I mean it's great and I mean I I I think it's always worthwhile to hear these other views because um you know no one really knows right I mean you know no one really knows and you know one thing that I've wrestled with a lot before and I've seen other people do this too is like you know just because someone gets something right doesn't mean they're going to be right they're going to keep being right right and also just because someone gets something wrong doesn't mean they're GNA be keep being wrong I mean you know markets change no one knows what's going to happen and I I I could see eth Bitcoin carving out a bottom this summer um that's kind of my base case I could see that actually happening so we'll see if that happens Rob what are your thoughts I mean I know you're you're more of a you're more of a Bitcoin Maxi yourself right Bitcoin dominance to 100% I yes exactly go ahead Ben what was your question I'm just kidding I'm just kidding what what are your thoughts here on on on dominance do you think it's uh you think we're getting pretty close to the uh to the top well first of all let me just say that I I I was like listening to to Max especially on like the Twitter spaces and things like that he's very smooth in his delivery and very smart and and what he talks about so I gotta tell you it's good to hear like different sets of opinions it's great to have a Max here so to talk about I mean Bitcoin dominance I got to tell you like when you were talking the 60% I'm like yeah you know I can kind of see it you know I was I was I was under the assumption like well you know it always kind of comes back that way right something happens there's something that happens in the market a Black Swan event or you know something that's just that kind of has disruption and then people get scared and they're they're like okay I'm risk on but not that risk on to go into like you know Pepe coin I'm gonna go into the safest asset in the most volatile industry which would be Bitcoin and I I could see that for sure but then like there's a narrative that that people are always talking about especially in in in the crypto space being the Bitcoin maxos are going to say Bitcoin only right but there are narratives that are out there one of those is dpin Right centralized physical infrastructure Network the other one are dexes because we see what's going on with the centralized exchanges getting sued getting their pants sued off by the SEC and then leaving of course so we have to have dexes and then of course there's another big one which is web 3 so we talk about that but there's one that I feel is on an undertone and Max alluded to it when he was talking about it when he talked about runes and he talked about ordinals and he talked about things like stacks and l2s and I think what's gonna really push Bitcoin dominance up I know Ben loves this part too is uh the the l2s or even l1s that are going to be built on bitcoin Ben if you just throw this this chart up I always talk about this website it's l2. watch so imagine this and I and and and even like Adam back has talked about this how he's talked about he hates the fact that everybody's building off of Bitcoin people should just build on bitcoin because he says it's like it's it's like the tcpip layer for for the internet so why can't they just build on the most the safest most secured Network or\n",

      "the the l2s or even l1s that are going to be built on bitcoin Ben if you just throw this this chart up I always talk about this website it's l2. watch so imagine this and I and and and even like Adam back has talked about this how he's talked about he hates the fact that everybody's building off of Bitcoin people should just build on bitcoin because he says it's like it's it's like the tcpip layer for for the internet so why can't they just build on the most the safest most secured Network or computerized Network ever built in the entire world and he was right so when I take a look at these these l2s that are coming out and they're all new so you I to understand like this some most of these are trash let's just let's just call it SP Spade but like when we talk about things that are coming out that are actually doing pretty good like a Stax who's been around for quite some time I can really see things actually happening for sure and then like I just dropped a a video on my second Channel where I talked about core core is a top uh 50 well it's 56 now but it's essentially an L1 L2 type of uh uh token which is built right on top of Bitcoin using delegated proof of work and delegated proof of stake together to actually make dexes nfts and a whole host of things you can only do with smart contracts so when I see stuff like this happening I'm like why can't we take away the nonsense that's going on over in ethereum world and they're massive gas fees like just like with with core and stacks right now if you use it or the things that are being built on top of it they're just going through their Satoshi initiative it's super cheap and it's super fast so for me to see that Bitcoin dominance could go up why couldn't it especially with the different institutions that are here and how they've been drilled into it now they can say oh there's something else I can do and also smart I see it could actually go above 60% but again I'm not always right no I mean I I've it's possible it's certainly possible um I think the answer is going to probably come in the next few weeks because you know there's two prior examples where we had these kind of these like closes below the 8we ese 2021 and 2019 and in 2021 after it happened Bitcoin got a rally eth Bitcoin went up but in 2019 when Bitcoin got that rally eth Bitcoin went down so I think if we see Bitcoin get some type of relief I don't know maybe sometime after the having into may I I don't know exactly when it would be but whenever that comes whatever happens to eth bitcoin should be very telling about where we are in the cycle so I I'm going to be focused a lot on that um over the next few weeks but we will see um next question Rob I'm GNA start with you on this one to rotate and you know I remember last year you saying something like this um and and you ended up being correct it was basically you know sell and man go away um like I mean no one's D Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear since October I mean you know I mean it was basically like 25 to 30k not even that long ago um and I I think sometimes we forget just how quickly it has moved so I'm curious like do you think it's going to be similar to last summer where we just get the market gets boring before maybe moving up again like later in the year or something you think it's just going to get boring for a few months um do you think or on the other hand do you think everyone's gonna get think it's boring and then we just get another you know face what's it called like a face melting Rally or something that's exactly face yeah I mean like so so what are your thoughts going into the summer because I mean again I know last summer you you thought it was going to be boring do you think it's going to be boring again this summer or you think it's going to be different Matt well first of all I I hope so I I really do because everybody who's in the chat right now answer a question for me uh tell me if you think that you've accumulated enough where you're like you know what I've bought plenty of Bitcoin and I just cannot handle any more bags I just I don't want to buy anymore especially if it goes down and gets cheaper just let me know in the comment section because it seems like when these types of things Ben when you say things are boring this is great because this is when people who like the dollar cost average is fantastic or if you're Dynamic DCA is things go down which I think where we at the risk levels now 0.6 0.59 somewhere around there a little yeah I think a little above 0 six so like if we're in this place we're like well I mean for me this is a good time to just accumulate a little bit but as we start to like if it goes sideways well great I have more time to bring things in but then if you if you want to talk about selling May and go away there's this great chart on this website that I steal from constantly and if you just take a look because it's it's yeah it's a nice website it's very nice I think there's a sale going on until like tomorrow and then it goes away so but if if you say sell in May and go away it it actually works out pretty well I mean historically speaking but then if you really want to break it down because people say but Rob you don't get it because this is the having year so it's all it doesn't really it count well if you take a look at it I mean if you sold at the end of May of 2020 I mean you had a 30% increase on January a couple of drops there 34 and 10% and then you're down here and you just kind of stay away until October and then you buy in and then October rallies November rallies and December rallies that's not bad I mean I'll take that year right and if we go back to 2016 I mean it's the same type of thing if I want to sell in May okay well June's gonna go up but I have red red I take I stay away September as well and I I buy back in October November December I'm doing pretty good so I still think it can work out all right the thing that you have to understand though and one more thing is is this there's a presidential election I think this is going to be pretty tumultuous as we get into it so there was this piece from hbk's wealth and it talked about the presidential election years versus the non-election as far as returns and this is just taking a look at the S&P 500 you can see that in the presidential election years which this is that year it sends to like kind of peek off around March April and then just kind of fall away until we get into junisha may go away October is here you buy back in and then we have a nice little rally of course drop here and then off we go but 10% for that year is not too bad now does that mean that I'm going to sell everything no no I'm just telling you these are just the data points that we can say take a look at me personally I'm just here to accumulate and uh get into some early round type of cryptos that could either make a lot of money or go to zero one of those two will always happen yeah I was looking at this um this is uh this is the S&P 500 in 2024 compared to the average of all election years right I mean so you can see like it has come down a lot recently but it also went up a lot too like way more than it does on average so there's just been a lot more volatility this cycle than I think we've seen in a lot of Prior Cycles um but yeah I I thought that was interesting and that chart sort of reminded me of that uh Max what are your thoughts here I mean I know earlier you said you expected uh risk to do pretty well um over the next six months but you know even with that do you think that the market could cool off before that phase or do you think it's not going to really get much of a breather or do you think the Breather is almost over yeah that's it's a it's a great question of course we're all from relatively familiar with the uh maybe cliche but overused but also kind of accurate saying of sell and may go away um one thing that I've been preaching for a while going back to I mean even I would say Q4 of last year is that I was seeing signs early on of a maybe expedited cycle for crypto um and it's probably off of of you know the back of this this fed paw and there isn't quite as much in my opinion economic deterioration as a lot had thought myself included and we're in this you know kind of Goldilocks window where risk can rally really unencumbered um you know so so do I think that selling may go away will come to fruition I I would think that worst case in my opinion from what I'm seeing right now and again of course subject to change it's just one man on the internet's opinion I think that similarly to how this cycle for crypto is being a little bit front Rand and we've actually seen for the first time a Bitcoin all-time high before a having which of course had never happened before um I also think it's possible that selling may go away is being front ran a little bit and we're seeing that right now with this April correction so similarly to Rob I am not I am not in the camp of you know drisking or selling spot because again like I mentioned in you know during our first question here if you just draw four vertical lines on your trading View and Mark out every Bitcoin having look what typically happens in the six to nine months following Additionally you know for a lot of us that have been slowly you know and thoroughly meticulously dcing into our digital digital assets and our unregistered Securities over the past year you know a lot of us have tax consequences for selling right now and I'm I'm not really interested in incurring any uh you know tax consequences trying to reposition because May perhaps is a little bit choppy so in my opinion you know and again going back you know the past 18 months for Bitcoin we haven't seen more than a 22% correction on bitcoin so from our local high recently take it down 22 to 25% maybe you get 57 56 worst case that's not enough for me to incur you know a taxable event to try to reposition so uh maybe it happens maybe it doesn't but for me ultimately it doesn't make a big difference because the having is in a couple days um and typically what happens after a having is months and months of prosperity and hopefully price discovery yeah no it's a fair point I mean I think like all the corrections that we've had by Bitcoin for the entire bull market have only been about 20 to 22% yeah we've already seen it go down about what 18% or so um so that I think that'll be the the area I mean if we get down there see if it turns around and if it does maybe the time's not different you know but yeah what do you think Ben do you think selling May and go away will come to ahead um I think now I mean so I so we went into the 7 to point8 risb in March so that I think was the time to to drisk some kind of like during the spot ETF um at this point it's kind of like when we went back to 39K after the spot ETF um we then it was it was a 22% drop and then we just rallied after it right and and so I was like you know this could be our preh having year dip and then the rally just continued and so now it's kind of the same thing it's like you know the the area to do it if you were convinced about it would have been in in March you know um when gold broke out because that's actually in 2019 when Bitcoin topped was when gold broke out um so I think that would have been the time to do it now I do think there is a risk of if you've waited if you've waited till this point and now bitcoin's down 20% we did see both in after the 20209 or the 2019 top and the 2021 top the first weekly close bow of the 8we SMA we then had a rally back up you know to the we right which is around 67k we actually went slightly above it in both cases so I think what what's more important is not exactly what happens here at the range lows but it's what happens whenever we get a relief move does it sustain or does it just put in a lower high I think that is kind of the thing to look for because back in after the spot ETF it wasn't a lower high we just you know had another face ripping rally fire um the the reason why I am more cautious on this one than than the last one is because eth Bitcoin has now broken down and gold is broken out which both of those events marked the 2019 local top and it wasn't the market cycle top and this kind of goes back to what Rob was saying you know there is this idea of a left translated peak in 2024 and I can sort of like I'm like 30% maybe 40% aware of that like you know thinking hey this is this could actually happen you know if if we were to Rally into the summer to higher prices without cooling off then I would be very more so convinced of a left translated Peak but what if what if if you think about what happened after the 2019 top after gold broke out and after e Bitcoin broke down Bitcoin went into a six to n month bare Market in fact now imagine you get that after the having and everyone thinks the cycle is over by the end of 2024 because it just hasn't done anything since the having and then we just get another move in 2025 and then the cycle Peaks when it always does and once again everyone over complicated it you know like there is a chance that that that happens um so I would I think I would just watch to see what happens whenever we get any type of relief does it form into a lower high or does it lead to a higher high and then you probably have your answer to whether it's a left translit cycle or not at that point I can see absolutely yeah and again even in 2019 it was it was just a local top we bled for a while we actually bled back to the 100 we SMA um and then and then we started to go back back up and then we had the we had the pandemic crash but if you ignore that it was just sort of a bleed after all Bitcoin pairs broke down and then and then once we got that back you know we start to go back up those are my and and by the way I mean you've always said this going back when you know before I started my business and I was watching all of your videos you know years ago Ben you used to always say something kind of along the lines of you know the longer it takes you know the higher will ultimately go something along those lines and you know I think a uh this idea of a prolonged sort of midcycle Correction freaks a lot of people out because everybody wants to be rich overnight myself included right of course i' I'd love for us to just go straight up in a straight line and I hope that we do but ultimately I don't think it would be a death sentence for Bitcoin to kind of reestablish value between 55 and 75k for even a full quarter um you know I think ultimately would probably lead to more constructive uh price action to the upside in the long run but people you know their patients will be tested no question yeah yeah I mean I think the the the thing to look for in the cycle I think is is the Bitcoin dominance I I really do think it's the key for the cryptoverse and I think I think that dominance will Top before Bitcoin Falls below the 20we SMA that's my guess is that it's going to top before Bitcoin Falls below it and I think between now and then Bitcoin gets occasional rallies that just take off Bitcoin pairs even lower is my guess um so that's why I just say like you know if you want exposure to crypto Bitcoin I mean you know Bitcoin is is a relatively safe bet if you want to take on more risk there's obviously the altcoin market there's the full DJ mcoin Market um but you have to be careful with those and I I I think the winning strategy with the altcoin market and and even if you are in the riskier memec coin stuff is just to remember like in five years that Meme coin is probably not going to exist No One's Gonna care about it because they're going to be worried about the next stage of mean points right so the way the way to navigate it is it's okay to have exposure to various parts if you want to take more risk but just occasionally convert it back to bitcoin if you make a lot of money right because at least you know you then know hey Bitcoin is still going to be around in 10 years I don't know if this random meme coin is Ben how could you say that how dare you my a meme coins oh my I think I've converted most of my audience to bitcoin Maxis at this point but I will say by the time I convince the last person to be a Bitcoin Maxi that's when the dominance tops out and we go back the other way I don't think we're that far away I think maybe this summer dominance tops out we'll see though but you are correct like what anybody out there like if we're being completely honest Would You Bet Your Life that Your Meme coin or your altcoin is going to be around in 50 years would You Bet Your Life on it I probably would not would I bet my life I mean it's an extreme example right would I bet my life or something valuable that Bitcoin will be around bet your would you bet all your money on it or something right that's much more friendly right so and I would for Bitcoin I have a high degree of confidence and that's why your strategy ultimately it's conservative you know relative to a lot of other people that you know talk about crypto publicly but it is ultimately a long-term winning strategy and people need to recognize that profits from altcoins ultimately do have to flow back into Bitcoin that is the sustainable strategy for sure yeah I mean I think Rob I think Rob was talking about this what last week on NFA live we were talking about like what do you do when you get an airdrop and I think what was your strategy like just 50% you take profits on it right away 50% back to bitcoin or USD and then you let there oh no no it was you let let it go up 2X or something or if it goes up 2x then you sell 50% was that what you said yeah I I call it well two things I call it the half and half method so you get into meme coins or something crazy and then let's say you put it you know 100 bucks in and then it goes $200 so then you sell half immediately and you put the other hundred bucks let it ride because that's house money then when it doubles or triples or or quadruples then you take half again or you take two or three or 4X what do you want to do and then you let the ride and you do that until there's no more riding and it just goes away and then you're like well okay I I did 8X but it went to zero so I don't feel so bad because a lot of people just let it go all the way up and all the way down but if you just play with house money there's a reason why like like I I can see people in the in the chats going well this sucks because you know now we're gonna sideways and you know this isn't what I want to be there's a reason why all three of us are pretty much just like on all of our videos on all of our Twitter spaces we're pretty much the same person whether it goes massively up or way way down me's a little bit of excitement but it's because we der risked enough to like well if this happens then we do this if this happens we do that and I think that's where people should would want to be as opposed to just going okay I sold my kidney I hope this memec coin goes up it's one of those things have a plan no matter what and then enjoy your life don't stress about it right I mean have a plan like you know if Bitcoin goes to 50K or even lower so what have a plan if it goes up have a plan I mean it I I think you know I used to navigate crypto without without thinking about like what do I do if this happens I only would navigate it based on one particular outcome I never hedge myself but once I started hedging My Views then it makes things easier you know you're like all right well this is what I think but if I'm wrong I don't want to be you know completely left out of whatever that next trend is um and when I when I get air drops um well I don't I don't really get air drops anymore because I'm not really that active in in the space but when I did when I used to get air drops my strategy was immediately convert half of it to bitcoin at least half to\n",

      "I never hedge myself but once I started hedging My Views then it makes things easier you know you're like all right well this is what I think but if I'm wrong I don't want to be you know completely left out of whatever that next trend is um and when I when I get air drops um well I don't I don't really get air drops anymore because I'm not really that active in in the space but when I did when I used to get air drops my strategy was immediately convert half of it to bitcoin at least half to bitcoin and then let whatever else ride because like half the time they would just go to zero anyways um so at least you get some of that value out in inss um why don't we goe and move on because we do have two more questions and then I'd also like to get to audience questions at the end if you post your question now I probably won't see it so maybe wait like 10 minutes and then post it um this is an interesting question and I to be completely honest most people aren't going to care but gold is is one of these things where like it doesn't do anything for like 10 years you know and like if you think about this entire bitcoin's like like it's entire history essentially since 2009 gold has essentially gone nowhere in that in that entire phase but we just saw gold break to new all-time highs and it seems to be a somewhat explosive rally so I'm curious about what your thoughts are on gold um I I often think that people who like gold are are more alike to people who like Bitcoin than they would care to admit I think the main difference is the generation that we are right so if I were born one or two generations ago I probably would have been really into gold you know but because I'm born into more of the digital age I'm more into Bitcoin so I think we're more alike than different um so I'm curious like what your thoughts are on gold here it is now 2300 2400 um max where do you you know do you think that uh this is going to continue I me Silver is also not too far behind it in its own move um and I guess the other question is like why do you think gold is rallying so that's probably the bigger question is is why do you think it's rallying rather than like what do you think it's going to go to sure yeah the gold strength is um pronounced it's very impressive um and and I would say I mean why do people buy gold historically right it's sound money it was sound money before Bitcoin it was a store of value when you know our our parents generation was nervous about the state of the world they would you know convert their into gold and uh you know a lot of it is more of a um it's a mental thing it's a it's a mental insulation it's not like if your country was invaded you're going to put you know 500 pounds of gold on your back and somehow travel to another country right but it's a it's a peace of mind thing you know and you know again historically it is you know a sound currency uh there is a scarcity aspect to it there's a lot of commonality and overlap between gold and Bitcoin and I think everything you mentioned Ben is correct um I would say that my bias on gold um really stems more on my perspective and my my forecast on where I think dxy is headed and similarly where I think Bitcoin is headed I've already shared my opinion on where I think Bitcoin is going we have the Bitcoin having just around the corner um I expect Bitcoin to you Trend upwards aggressively over the next six to nine months subsequently I do believe that dxy is forming a sort of distribute you know a distribution here I do anticipate dxy topping very soon and again if you just overlay gold with dxy on a weekly chart you can see that there is a pretty prominent negative correlation between dxy and gold so I don't think we're I'm not of the opinion that we're going to see a decoupling where there's suddenly a a prolonged period of a positive correlation where gold rallies and dxy rallies I think that one of them is lying so either gold is lying or dxy is lying I think that gold is leading and going to see dxy of course sort of reclaim that negative correlation and begin to take a dive over the next quarter so um I do expect gold to continue upwards and I think it's probably off the back of the you know dxy weakening okay yeah fair enough um it has it has been really strong you know and I I can't help but look at it I'm like wow you have like a 10-year base I the bigger the base the more explosive the rally and for I mean for I know like all the crypto you know Deens are like you know it's up what like 10% or something and like people are like you know like 10% is like a minute candle on a meme coin right but for gold you know for an asset that's that high market cap like that is a big move in a really short period of time and so like that's why it it it means something Rob what are your thoughts here um are you are you are you watching this gold move I'm not watch I mean but I own it I own gold and silver and I I think and I don't I never UND and we talk about this many times I never understood why the old maximalists and this and the precious metal maximalists hate Bitcoin so much because like you said we're trying to all do the same thing we're trying to get out of the Matrix which is relying on paper Fiat and it just seems like I there's there's that one gold bug guy that is what we all talk about for some god- awful reason but in reality I think for the majority of people that are into precious metals I think they can see the value behind it and of of of Bitcoin itself and like I I like I never understood with this guy like why don't we have a debate between that guy and like Mike Maloney Mike Maloney is huge into gold he's put out a great series on precious medals and he's he likes Bitcoin as well so like when I take a look at this I I think you know why why not own why not old gold why not diversify like you know uh we've got I diversify not just in the crypto but the stocks precious metals and and real estate and I think everybody should do the you know kind of do the same thing but to talk about why gold went up so much let me I I don't know but how did gold do in 2022 was there any kind of rally during that time I mean it it it it still mostly stayed below the high I don't really think it did that well um it's only recently really started to show strength I mean I can I can pull it up and see but 2022 was kind of split it rallied in the first half of the year and then didn't really do too much and actually corrected a little bit looks like yeah I mean it looks like it topped in March of 2022 and then basically just went down yeah till November and then it rallied again into December kind of there there's a theory going around about why Gold's rallying so much it's because the Nations that are going to war they are trying they're fearful of us sanctions so how do how do you get away get around those sanctions well you stockpile Alternatives and one of those would be of course gold so people are talking about how Iran could be could have stockpiled after the Damascus situation and the and the bombing and the reason why I ask about 2022 is because for the Ukraine Invasion I think was February 2022 and the same type of thing was being said about Russia stockpiling gold at the same time so I can see I can kind of see that that valuation I don't know why they don't just use Bitcoin it's a heck of a lot easier to transfer and zip around value but that's where we're at yeah I always like I always think those posts by the gold bugs are so disingenuous because I mean like I I own both like I own Bitcoin and gold but like if you go to trading View and you look at the Bitcoin or you look at the Gold valuation against Bitcoin it's down so much since Bitcoin launched that it rounds it to negative 100% like like that's how far the valuation of gold has fallen against Bitcoin since Bitcoin has been around so again like it's not it's just look I mean the the Bitcoin valuation as far exceeded gold for a long time um I mean my guess is over the next 20 years Bitcoin will still outperform gold you know maybe in the short term gold could outperform uh Bitcoin but and I I mean I guess it has been since March right ever since gold broke out Gold's been doing better than even the S&P 500 even the NASDAQ um it's been having my view is that I I I think that gold is breaking out because it senses that um rate cuts are coming sooner than the market is potentially thinking and so that's kind of why I think I I think it's sort of sniffing something out just like it did in 2019 and and um but we'll see I mean you know we'll see if it if it plays out in the same way last question and I mean I you know this is more so geared towards Max um because I mean Rob is I mean you know you've been around here forever we' probably even asked this question you before yeah but I mean if you want to take it if you want to answer you can Max Max yeah so since you're new here um why did you start your YouTube channel I mean like what what was your motivation what are you helping to accomplish with it uh what brings you here well Ben you you actually played a big role in in bringing me here I was a very early follower of yours actually before you even had your website I bought your Google sheet way back in the day and I'm still locked into my original price thank you very much because I got in early pays to get in early um you know I I learned a lot from you in the very beginning and I went through last cycle and you know Ben and and Rob also this you know this is a compliment to both of you guys amongst a sea of grifters and thieves and people looking to prey on unsuspecting retail you know guys like yourselves you you conducted yourselves in a manner that you know I mean I can't even imagine how many millions of dollars you guys turn down from shill deals and you know crap like that and you know I I wanted to in the beginning play my you know play my part in that I felt as though I had opinions that you know um I could share something to offer I have you know I have an ability to lead I have you know an ability to organize a team um and I wanted to play my my part my equal share in the sort of collective hive mind of you know CT and and YouTube and help educate that's sort of the underpinning of of what I'm doing is I like to teach I like to collaborate and you know making money certainly feels nice right but there's a certain there's a certain sense of fulfillment that I personally get out of somebody messaging me saying hey because of what you said it made a difference in my life and something clicked for me and that feels really good and you know I I started because Bitcoin and it was it's a small Channel still um we're growing quickly certainly which of course if you go to Ben's beautiful website and you overlay social media growth with uh you know the price of Bitcoin you can see why I'm starting to grow quicker it's it's I'm doing the same thing I was doing all bare Market it's just suddenly more people care about crypto so um you know I am a i a result of good times and I pray that they continue on because of course it's you know a nice Tailwind for for my young business but yeah I mean really to answer the question Point Blank I love to teach I love to to collaborate and I love to debate you know like I have a differing opinion than you know you guys for some things and there's some overlap but that's what makes a market beautiful is that you can think one thing I can think another and we can come together and just talk about it politely and nobody knows what's going to happen right like we can't I have my hunch I have conviction just like you guys do but Bitcoin dominance could go to 90% And you know even over flip it and put that on on Twitter don't do that don't do that or or it could literally nuke down to 10% we could have like the crypto equivalent of the NASDAQ bubble between 1995 and 2000 where altcoins bubble like people you know can't imagine everybody's thrown money at altcoins speculating anything that's crypto and then 99 out of 100 of them don't exist in a couple years you know so who who knows what's going to happen but yeah I love to to collaborate and teach and debate and uh generally it's it's just a passion of mine how many subscribers are you guys at now like 13 14k or something yes on YouTube somewhere in between there yeah well there's 3,600 people watching so if everyone here goes and clicks the link in the description below and goes over to Max's Channel and subscribes then uh I I'm sure he would appreciate that and I think he deserves that he's been they've been putting out they it's not just Max by the way I mean it's a team of people um so go check that out you guys do like daily live streams right we Yeah we actually have a show coming up at uh 10:00 a.m. eastern time we do a Daily Show we've got a panel of Five Guys we're all just Traders wrap this one up then if you got it coming up in 10 minutes that's okay I got a big team they got it all right well before we before we end it here I I did want to take at least a couple of questions um and one of the questions I saw was um what is the best way to learn about crypto and to do your own research so I mean I don't know if they're talking about like from a fundamental perspective but I if someone were getting into crypto like like what do you guys use to do your research and I mean and maybe talk about like all the different tool or some at least some of the bigger tools that you guys have been using especially for all the different things that are happening in the cryptoverse there seems like there's a thousand different narratives that you could you know that you could follow and whoever wants to take that one is fine go ahead Max yeah um I would start on uh one of our three channels I think that's a really good place not to not to spew the obvious but um I would say I would say learn to do very basic ta right and understand Cycles like there's some very awesome free indicators out there like I mean you can even just look at like you know Ben has a a you he's kind of coined a very famous one he's combined a 20 week SMA and a 21 we EMA which has been sort of uh marketed as the bull market band for good reason right so you can determine when you know Bitcoin is trending upwards High time frame or trending down by just a simple you moving average band there's also things like the P Cycle top which I think people should keep an eye on which is again a free trading view indicator someone someone made it it's also on Ben's website there's also some some good onchain stuff like you know Bitcoin terminal price hoddle waves things like that I would as a beginner I would stay off the hourly time frame like literally just go daily time frame and above um and whenever you see Bitcoin down you know 50% from its its all-time high that's time to start paying attention to maybe consider entering the market but you know learn very very basic ta and and some of the more popular onchain indicators can really help you just DCA at the right time you know but stay off of the hourly time frames mainly the py cycle top just to give credit is uh was developed by Philip Swift um a while back and I the the idea was to predict the top with within 3 days and it did a really great job of doing that in the first uh the first 2021 Peak um and it actually happened I remember it happening and like no one really believed it you know um but I think it was retrofit right it was fit after yeah it was created in 2019 it was created in 2019 okay but it did it did get the first top in 2021 I feel like a lot of these like metrics that everyone created in 2019 uh it they called the first top but then most of them like didn't really call the second top because it was just sort of like a it was like a dead cat bounce that just somehow made it to New highs you know yeah um so yeah that was kind of an interesting one um Rob did you have anything to add just yeah just one thing Max makes all great points the thing I would say is that if you really knew you really really knew you have to understand that it's not how much you make it's how much you keep and the big thing is that you have to watch out for scams and things to watch out for and if you're gonna get into like hot storage wallets stuff like that there's a there's a video in the in the link of in the description of all my videos and it says you know things you the the big mistakes in crypto and it has like 20,000 views and of course it's the most important video I probably have ever put out because that's what people get screwed out and they get scammed out and if they watch that video they wouldn't happen to them another video I did when I'm gonna sell on my crypto has over 100,000 views so it just goes to show you like where the priorities are the priorities are make money but really the priority should be keep money someone's asking a um this the Market's not pricing it in right now but I did see like last night there's been a couple of times here where like there's at least some in investors like thinking about a rate hike um that is not like my base case at all like I think they're done I I think five and a half percent is the terminal rate for this cycle they might go higher next cycle uh but I I think five and a half percent at the top I'm not going to ask you if you think they're gonna hike again because I don't really think any of us think they're going to um if you do think that let me know but I guess my main question is what do you think would happen if they did hike again um because that be I mean that would talk about markets not pricing it in right I mean like I guess the the implication would be like if if the economy just accelerates into you know again and and there's not a cool down and we just keep on moving up uh what would a rate what would another rate hike do well what was real quick what was what is what has Jerome Powell said about fighting inflation do they say that they're on the right track or do they say like there's it's more more stubborn what he they've kind of like the progress has slowed a lot and I I think they've kind of specul that it it might influence their the number of rate Cuts this year because previously they had said three rate Cuts this year and I'm I'm wondering if they're starting to walk I mean now the market is pricing in only two rate cuts through April of 2025 so I my view is that you know I thought higher for longer but now that everyone else believes it I think I think it's going to go back the other way because once the market fully prices in no rate Cuts that's when people give up and you need to start having some rate cuts um but yeah I don't know I mean pal Po's basically said the same thing he said for the last three years if you know they're they're going to keep rates higher for longer until inflation's durably going back to 2% yeah I I think that 3% is is the new 2% truthfully I I I appreciate their narrative and their consistency and and how they haven't wavered on that and I think it's a great goal um but it seems like three is kind of a magnet actually a little above three um like you mentioned they are currently pricing in now it looks like you know our first 25 basis point cut on the uh September 18th meeting and then through April 2025 and and these percentages change all the time right uh you know we'll see what happens um you know potentially taking us down 50 basis points off of where we're currently at um let me answer your question what would happen if we got another 25 basis point hike because you know inflation decides it's going to rear its ugly head again and and start trending up above you know headline four 5% God forbid it's over I mean like we are going to absolutely nuke if we get another rate I'm gonna be as as clear as I can be if we get another rate hike markets are going to capitulate like that will be awful horrible for risk\n",

      "down 50 basis points off of where we're currently at um let me answer your question what would happen if we got another 25 basis point hike because you know inflation decides it's going to rear its ugly head again and and start trending up above you know headline four 5% God forbid it's over I mean like we are going to absolutely nuke if we get another rate I'm gonna be as as clear as I can be if we get another rate hike markets are going to capitulate like that will be awful horrible for risk like sell all of your assets honestly like if that happens I'm not joking I think it'd be terrible I don't know if you guys agree with me but that would be horrible for markets but I don't think that's going to happen to be clear I think you could have the same thing happen if they just refuse to cut soon enough too because like it it you know like a tightening cycle is not just raising rates but it's also keeping rates too high for too long and the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and eight would have been in March um so we've already gone nine I think there's still you know there's still a window where talks about a soft Landing right it's so hard to thread that needle to a soft Landing because you have to stay high enough to make sure inflation doesn't come back in a second wave because if you don't and you get an inflation a secondary wave like the 70s you get a hard Landing but if you stay high for too long like let's say they stay at five and a half percent for another six months then you start to run the risk of of a deflationary crash right so that's why everyone sort of rolls their eyes about a soft Landing is because it's so difficult to thread that needle and I don't I do not envy their job I I do not envy their job because it's not and and they're also operating with long and variable lags like how can they know all the effects of prior monetary policy um so yeah it's it's a tough place for them to be and and we are oh sorry Rob go ahead no no go ahead Max I was going to say you know we are seeing some smaller economies in my opinion forecasting when our rate cuts are coming like we have seen the Czech Republic actually start to cut we've seen Poland cut um so it you know historically it's not perfect right but you are starting to see some of these smaller countries actually they they LED through the hik so they began to hike first they paused first and they've actually started to cut so I I do anticipate that you know in similar fashion to what has happened historically we will see the US begin to I guess cut rates hopefully uh later this year um but I do agree with you Ben like if they held rates where they're currently at through you know all of 2024 that would also put some pressure um on our economy and our markets but with that said like I don't know what you you guys think but I mean really the the final you know real dagger or Domino to fall is going to be of course unemployment creeping up above four four and a half percent do you guys think that if they just held rates where they're currently at all through 2024 um but we didn't see the labor market really deteriorate could financial markets hold up in that instance I mean if if the labor market doesn't deteriorate sure I just think that um I mean it seems like the unemployment rate is trending up um and the the problem with with that is that it doesn't tend to move in a linear fashion right it it goes slow and then it starts to accelerate at some point and we haven't reached the acceleration phase right so there's still a chance that we can avoid it but the longer they wait the the the riskier that's going to be I think I think there's a higher probability of a rate cut this summer than the market is giving credit for I don't think it has to happen this summer but I think the right thing to do is to cut at least 25 basis points uh this summer 50 basis points something like that just uh provide something you know are you thinking in the June meeting or July meeting I mean look last cycle I know that that the altcoin market was a lens into the consumer and I know that that when alts broke down against Bitcoin and when eth broke down against Bitcoin the FED basically cut one month later um and we we have seen eth fall against Bitcoin it had a weekly close below the June low we saw madic Bitcoin uh crash below it's June 2022 low we've seen adaa Bitcoin and Dot bit coin we've seen Litecoin Bitcoin and a Bitcoin I mean so many of these altcoins are are falling off their Bitcoin support levels and you can see it with the Bitcoin dominance so I think that the pricing out of all these rate Cuts is going to cause them to get priced in because the FED does not base their decisions on what our altcoins are doing right un they don't care what I what I what I find unfortunate is that a lot of the small like companies like Mom and Pop shops a lot of them are going out of business business right now because you know rates are going up and and and times are getting harder like inflation is so high so people just can't afford as much and but the FED has to do it because all of us Deens in the in the space can't help ourselves from bidding up jpegs you know and and and leading inflation uh to to where it was so I think that it's it's kind of a tough spot to be and the FED has to stay long enough to kind of break the animal spirits but if they do it too long then you then then you run the other issue of of a deflationary um unwind and that's not really fun either I know like people are like oh I'd love to go to the store and not spend as much money but if you if prices go down that's probably not good for risk assets terrible just yeah so everybody everybody who's watching the videos remember this when when you think like okay the Bitcoin Market or the crypto Market has to do this thing it has to do this thing because it's it's been the cycle that's always done this doesn't actually work like what we just talked about just how fragile the markets actually are and just to think how things have to really go in line before you realize that oh maybe I should have taken some profits when there was uh everything was overheated just it's just something to think about because I hate people who roundtrip and uh they really should again take some profits when everything gets too hot and and one thing just to mention about rate cuts and I mean you guys probably know this rate Cuts inherently are not bearish right it's it's the underpinning as to why they are cutting rates and you know if you actually on a granular level you go and you overlay the effective federal funds rate with you know the NASDAQ or S&P 500 markets actually tend to rally for like 30 to 60 days give or take following the First Rate cut until they wake up and they realize oh crap there's economic deterioration under the surface which is why they're cutting rates and then we see these major Corrections so I think whether the first 25 basis point comes in June or the end of July meeting or I guess hopefully September um that's probably your 30 to 60-day warning truthfully whenever it comes and I don't know when it will and what about no go ahead I was going to say you're right I mean like the rate Cuts inherently are are are bullish for risk assets if they're cutting for the right reasons in 2019 while Bitcoin topped out when rate Cuts arrived the S&P 500 kept going up and you know because the mark like the the economy was not in a recession right it wasn't going into a recession they were sort of like preliminary rate Cuts You could argue that Bitcoin is more tied to financial markets today traditional markets today than it was back then because of the spot ETF so maybe it would track the S&P 500 a bit closer than it did last cycle once rate Cuts arrive but the issue is why the FED is cutting are they cutting because they're trying to get ahead of something bad that's coming or are they cutting as a reactionary thing because they just saw a really bad labor market prance and that is is when they're not bullish like that's when rate cuts are be so it all depends on Max is right it all depends on why they're cutting and and I think that it's also risky to I I I do believe that there's just as much risk to the UPS side truthfully where you know assuming that they're going to cut because there is severe economic deterioration can also be you know a very harmful strategy long term because like you mentioned the first batch of rate cuts that we saw in 2019 um you know the S&P 500 rallied out of those cuts like 15% and then of course we had our Co nuke in March which took us below you know where that that first uh cut occurred right but you know again it's like you have to be very careful you kind of threading your own needle per se because just because they're cutting doesn't mean sell everything right because they could cut you know the labor market could be more resilient than anybody's expecting the S&P 500 could go up 50% over the next year and then something bad happens and you get a correction but that correction doesn't take you down to as low as the point in which the first cut happens so you just have to be a little bit careful truthfully you know you have to really understand why they're cutting and and it's a tough thing to do it's very tough I me with the S&P you know there there's been all sorts of like crises throughout all the decades but if you just pull up a chart over a 100 years I mean you know the the the overall trend is clear you know um the markets generally go up because the money supply yeah yeah you know why did prices of houses go up 40% because the supply of money went up 40 per. you know it's not it's not I it's not really that complicated so yeah no I mean I think like as always right like time in the market often beats time the market um because it's impossible to to actually time the market for under most circumstances and I think sometimes people get lucky with it and then assume that they're like a genius and can do it again and again and again um but the reality is that the market will humble us all at some point why don't we go ahead and wrap it up there um we we'll have NFA live back I guess next week next week I think it'll be on Rob's Channel um so we'll see you guys over there next week and again if you're not subscribed uh to to Max or Rob links for their channels are in the description below and uh we will see you guys next time bye\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin dubious speculation if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom link is in the description below the prices will be going up after the having so make sure to lock in the lower rate between now and then we have a website full of thousands of charts for different cryptocurrency um and I also put out three uh videos a week on on the premium side uh so a lot of stuff going on over there make sure you guys check that out links in the description below let's go and jump in so lots happening in the cryptoverse right now um I've talked a lot about sort of the mechanics behind different ways in which the cryptoverse operates and so in this video what I'd like to do is revisit a lot of those things and and kind of talk about like where we are and what we might see going into into the summer if if things play out like like they have in the past and you know it's only you know the having is is coming up really soon I mean I'm I'm recording this video Wednesday night the having is only a couple days away by the time you see this video it might only be a day away um so certainly a lot that's an exciting event in the cryptoverse but I'm more so in this video focused on what just do the charts say what's going on with the charts so let's go ahead and jump in with things like the bull market support band The 8we ese one of the interesting things to note about the 8we SMA is that there is this exception right here where we sort of got a a fake out below it and we talked about it how you know if you just get right back Above It Without Really any follow through the following week then it it is just a fake out and that happens just like you had a fake out right here above the bullmark sport B it does sometimes happen um it doesn't mean the general view is not worthwhile to follow of following the 8we ese it's just that sometimes you do get those very brief fake outs one of the things that I've mentioned many many times is that falling below the 8we SME would be a significant Milestone and this drop here at this point does seem somewhat significant be that as it may you know I don't know what's going to happen going into the having I imagine the Bulls would try uh their hardest to get it back above the 8we SMA but the 8we SMA is all the way back up at at 67k you I'm not saying it's impossible but it is quite a bit higher than where we currently are now let's go through a scenario where we close the week below the 8we moving average and I just want to go back and look at what previously happened after these manic rallies that lasted for a long time what happened after we got that first close below the 8we estimate and we're going to look at three examples we're going to look at 2019 we're going to look at at um 2021 early 2021 we're going to look at the second peak in 2021 okay so in 2021 the first peak of 2021 what you'll notice and by the way there are some there definitely are similarities right between this rally here um and and this one over here notably this we really got kicked off right here in October of 2020 and it and it sort of rallied out until March and April right we had a March Peak and then an April Peak which was slightly higher this rally also really got going in October after of it built out a base right I mean you can kind of see the same thing how Bitcoin built out a base here and then went into its Mania mode starting in October with it topping out ultimately in April kind of the same thing right I mean it it sort of built out its base again and then this move really got started in October with a potential local top at least uh in in March uh so far so what's interesting is if you zoom in to this trend it actually does look somewhat familiar um right here you can see that you know you we had a couple of red weeks uh we had a couple of red weeks right here really small red weeks just like that one then we had a couple of small green weeks that took us right back up kind of the same thing and then you had another Wick up now the main difference this time though is that in 2020 and 2021 in that rally what we ultimately saw happen was that the first Peak actually occurred in March was a lower high than the actual top in April of a higher high in this case at least what we've seen so far is that the local top in March has actually exceeded so far the top that we have seen in April but you will you will know there's you know two pretty clear Wicks there um just like there were right here and ever since then Bitcoin has been coming back down now what you will notice though is that after the first weekly close below the 8we moving average Bitcoin then actually had a relief rally back above its 8-week moving average right it have had a relief rally back above it and I know that often times you will see Bitcoin find local tops in April we saw a local top in April of 2021 and in April of 2013 even in 2023 we had a local top in April before just sweeping the highs in June so April does tend to be a significant month but also you know I talked a lot about how there is this other idea about how going into the merge eth actually topped out one month before the merge before getting a fairly substantial pullback right if you look closely here the merge was in September which was here which actually was in fact a lower high you know um and and so I I do think that's a relevant way to think about the market as well but going into this move here that first weekly close below the 8we s ma we then got a TW we relief rally following it now not all of these Trends are going to be the same there's somewhere that doesn't happen and we're going to go through each one so in the first one though you will note that there is a low here and then a higher low we ultimately saw Bitcoin bottom out a local bottom between this low in March and the low in February right so you can see we went below that low but we stayed above the one from March now if you go to today you will see something at least so far is similar right there's this low here in March that we have gone below but we yet haven't gone below that occurred a little we haven't gone below this low at least not yet that occurred a little bit before that so I would say watch that especially going into the weekend you know do we take out that low do we not if we don't take out that low um and we are still you know we get a weekly close below the 8we SMA then look to see if it does get uh that sort of a bounce if it does what happens and and this is the you know the question I've seen a lot of people debating this on on X um and and on and of course on YouTube and a lot of people are assuming right they're assuming that in such a bounce that bit coin Domin they think that they would say that Bitcoin dominance would go down right in such a balance their speculation some of them is that Bitcoin dominance would go down right I mean basically everyone on crypto X has been calling the top on bitcoin Dominus for the last two and a half years so why should this time be any different but they're essentially saying that if it does bounce here the Bitcoin dominance will go down now I'm actually going to show you there is at least some evidence to support that potential view but it's not my base case in fact now you might say why because if you look in 2021 you will notice that that is exactly where the eth tsunami occurred do you guys remember the eth tsunami right it was when eth basically goes up about 2x in two weeks and it occurred on a dead cap Bounce by Bitcoin do you see what happened with eth Bitcoin during that time it skyrocketed so you might say Ben if that were to happen why wouldn't eth Bitcoin do the same thing well again I am glad you asked and I think there is a relevant way to look at the market that would dispute that view the first way which is a bit hand wavy and I'm not asking you to take it to the bank is that leading into that move e Bitcoin was in an uptrend right so it was sort of putting in higher lows and higher highs and also the Fed was expanding their balance sheet right so we know that when the FED expands their balance sheet we see eth Bitcoin go up when the FED reduces their balance sheet we see e eth Bitcoin go down okay so pretty clear so then beyond that let's suppose other than just saying well it was going up over here therefore it was going to keep going up it's going down over here therefore it's going to keep going down other than the momentum argument what can we look towards okay and this is where when you look very closely at 2019 you should find the answer that you are looking for and that answer lies within a very similar bounce after going below the 8we SMA now look very closely at Bitcoin in 2019 a lot of people refuse to compare Bitcoin in 2024 to 2019 because they say this is the having year that was a a a preh having year so why should we make the comparison the reason why we should make the comparison is because 2019 was a p pivot year for the Federal Reserve and I suspect that 2024 will also be a pivot year for a long time there's been a lot of debate as to whether monetary policy actually affects crypto in the same way it does traditional markets and I've obviously been on the side that it does there's been a lot of people that say that it doesn't and that's why they thought that Bitcoin dominance was going to top out last year because in 2020 in 2019 it topped out in the prehab year right in the last cycle it topped out in the prehab year so they assume that it it would do that in if you don't if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about if you go over to say a year-to-date Roi of of Bitcoin dominance right we worked it in right if you go over and look at a year-to DAT Roi of Bitcoin dominance without stable coins and you look at 2024 you will see that if you compare it to 2016 2016 it basically just went down 2012 well 2012 there wer any other coins but 2020 it basically just went down right um 2024 it's just been staying mostly up and it hasn't really seen that large of move to the downside and I think that is a lot and that's evidence right there that shows you that monetary policy is having an effect in the prior cycle we were already back to QE and so Bitcoin dominance was going down but we're still in quantitative tightening right now so the answer to the question of why wouldn't eth Bitcoin see a durable rally upon a potential you know sort of relief rally back up to the 8we SME if it were to even come which there's no guarantee and we're going to get to a third example in a minute is 2019 now you see what happened in 2021 right the first weekly close below the 8we SMA we got this relief rally and eth Bitcoin shot up quite a lot right we know that and I just showed it a second ago but I I'll pull it back up eth Bitcoin will overlay it on the screen you can see pretty clearly during that move if I make make make these different colors here but during that move we saw eth Bitcoin go up so why should this time be different well if you look at 2019 and you look at the exact same pattern what you will notice is that it played out very similar to 2021 in fact it's just that the nature of what happened to the rest of the market was completely different look at 2019 we also had a weekly close below the 8we SMA the week of July 22nd right you see it pretty clearly right there right the week of July 22nd a weekly close below the 8we SMA in fact that Weekly close below the 8we SMA occurred exactly 4 weeks later after the local top right exactly 4 weeks later if you go look at it over here from this local top it might be a little bit further out but you can see it's been five weeks later potentially if we in fact get that Weekly close below the 8we SMA now what you'll notice is that just like 2021 Bitcoin had a relief rally following its first weekly close below the 8we SMA but in that case you did not see eth Bitcoin go up instead instead you saw it continue to go down right it continued to go down on that relief rally why did it continue to go down well first of all it was already turning down into that area right so momentum continued to carry it down but also you can see that the Fed was still reducing the size of their balance sheet and therefore while in 2021 the Dead the the the relief rally that came actually in May right I mean it it actually occurred um in it really materialized late April going into early May kind of a very similar setup if you think about it right late April going into early may you can see that it it it went back up to the 8we SMA and eth Bitcoin fell but the Fed was expanding the size of their balance sheet during that time today it's different in the sense that the FED is reducing the size of the balance sheet and so I think it's more tenable to compare it to what happened over here in 2019 where we got a similar type of move where eth Bitcoin actually dropped okay so that is why I think that is more likely that eth Bitcoin drops under such a circumstance that it actually goes up now there's no guarantee you even get a relief rally next week um there there's really no guarantee that that even happens at all and you know for for evidence for that you'd have to actually look no further than 2021 itself but at the second top right so in the second top after we fell below the 8we SMA um that first weekly close below it right rather than getting a relief rally the following week Bitcoin just capitulated down okay in in the week of November 29th right so it just capitulated down but I want to show you something uh on a lower time frame with eth Bitcoin because when I overlay it here you can only see a little bit of it look at the eth Bitcoin chart okay now look at Bitcoin USD and let's figure out what week this was where Bitcoin got the weekly close below the 8we ese in 2019 it was the week of July 22nd now look at eth Bitcoin the week of July 22nd where was it it was right here this was the week of July 22nd so it had just followed the breakdown of e Bitcoin delayed by one week actually delayed by one week so it's one week off here but the week that Bitcoin had its first weekly close below the 8we ES eth Bitcoin was actually a green candle and it occurred two weeks after eth Bitcoin broke down what happened the following week when Bitcoin got the relief rally back above the 8we SMA the week of July 29th and the week of August 5th you will see very clearly the week of July 29th and August 5th eth Bitcoin dropped 8 and a half% and then it dropped 75% now there could be some form of diminishing vol to the downside if you look at when eth Bitcoin has previously broken down you can see that in the first instance it actually dropped quite a lot from the range low it went down about 40 something per like 47 maybe even a little bit more um you know it went around down around 50% or so whereas in this drop over here it only dropped around 33% so it wasn't as big of a drop so perhaps if Bitcoin were to see some type of move like that um you could see e Bitcoin drop but you know getting you know as it's now below the range low which is exactly what happened right there that first move down after that was about a 20% drop that still wasn't the bottom but it was a 20% drop even if you get even if you get from here next week even if you get say a 10% drop that puts eth Bitcoin at 043 which coincidentally corresponds to this top here so my base case is that if we were to get some type of relief bounce into back up to the 8we SMA sometime in the next couple of weeks next few weeks or so then I would actually assume that eth Bitcoin continues to break down just like it did over here that would be my base assumption because we know where we are in the cycle based on on monetary policy that is my base assumption now there is something that theoretically challenges that now but before we get to that I I will say that there's no guarantee right if you're if you're over here thinking you know that means there's some type of relief rally that's going to come save your altcoin bags that might not actually be true because even if there is a relief rally that I buy Bitcoin that does not guarantee a commencer relief rally for whatever altcoin that you hold do you know over here when Bitcoin had that move back to the 8we SMA do you see that move 15% the week of July 29th 5% the week of August 5th pretty nice move right 15% followed by 5% what did eusd do right what did ethusd do those two weeks nothing I mean basically nothing the week of July 29th went up 5% so during a week where Bitcoin went up 15% eth went up 5% and then the following week when Bitcoin went up another 5% eth went was negative it dropped it dropped 3% so that was what caused the devaluation of the eth Bitcoin pair it was the fact that Bitcoin was bouncing around and it was just chopping the altcoin market up because there's a stronger bid for Bitcoin because the altcoin market just keeps on bleeding back to it so you can see pretty clearly that that's what happened right Bitcoin occasionally got relief bounces but it just I mean it ate the altcoin market up during that time and I think the same thing is happening now I think that Bitcoin is it's chopping around this range up here the same way it did in 2019 the same way right it's chopping around this range and every single week that we get any type of continued chop what's happening eth Bitcoin continues to slowly grind down Bitcoin dominance continues to slowly grind up what will likely Mark the top for Bitcoin dominance well it'll probably correspond sometime after the First Rate cut and it could correspond back to quantitative easing now what's interesting is if you look at at at Bitcoin us Bitcoin dominance topped before Bitcoin fell below the bull market support ban if you overlay Bitcoin dominance onto this chart you will see that it actually topped right here in September and then we fell below the bull market support band Bitcoin did just a couple of weeks later now I think something similar could happen again Bitcoin dominance could actually top before Bitcoin USD goes below the 20we SMA there's a good chance chance that could happen if this were to repeat itself but what needs to happen between now and then would be that Bitcoin just kind of chops around for a while and every time it gets those moves back up it breaks alts down even more remember during High rates and quantitative tightening Bitcoin rallies break the altcoin market down there is no guarantee that it has to be on a Bitcoin rally there are examples where all Bitcoin pairs break down on bitcoin dumps and you should have realized that this past week when Bitcoin dropped and altcoins dropped a lot more right we've seen it before it happened it it it also happened back over here in in May of 2022 you can see that Bitcoin dropped and during that time eth Bitcoin right as as Bitcoin dropped e Bitcoin initially went up or sorry no so this is Bitcoin dominance as this dropped Bitcoin dominance went up right and then you can see it went all it didn't top here until Bitcoin hit a local bottom so there's no guarantee you even get a relief rally back to the 8we SME if we end up following what happened over here in late 2021 so I think it would be foolish to say try to take that to the bank there's no guarantee furthermore even if you do get a relief rally it doesn't mean it has to start next week we already showed that it's off by a week when you look at eth Bitcoin so maybe maybe we just kind of sit hum drum for a week and nothing happens but imagine what that would be like if sometime after the having you know everyone is thinking oh you know that's it everything's over uh you know wo is me and then right as everyone gets up\n",

      "1. The video examines the behavior of the 8-week exponential moving average (8WE SMA) and its significance as a support level for Bitcoin.

      "3. The analysis suggests that the current market environment, characterized by the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening, is different from the 2021 scenario, where the Fed was expanding its balance sheet.

      "would be foolish to say try to take that to the bank there's no guarantee furthermore even if you do get a relief rally it doesn't mean it has to start next week we already showed that it's off by a week when you look at eth Bitcoin so maybe maybe we just kind of sit hum drum for a week and nothing happens but imagine what that would be like if sometime after the having you know everyone is thinking oh you know that's it everything's over uh you know wo is me and then right as everyone gets up or gives up there's some type of of relief and then everyone's like oh see I told you so and then it ends up just resolving into a lower high in May right and and maybe it resolves into a lower high in May because the unemployment rate in May comes in super hot or maybe the inflation rate comes in super hot I don't know um but that could be something to sort of keep in mind I do think there's a lot of evidence supporting a a potential summer lull um and I I want to talk a little bit about that I will say you know before I get too much further into this like guys like I could be wrong right I mean you know sometimes I get things wrong I'm not asking you to take these views to the bank I'm just doing the best I can sometimes I'm right sometimes I'm wrong come up with a strategy not based on what I'm saying please uh I just this is just my view on the market and again you know if you're looking for someone that's going to be 100% right about something if you find them don't tell anyone about them right I mean keep them to yourselves um but these are just my and and you know they may play out they may not so from here I mentioned earlier you know there's some evidence to suggest that you know that there could be still some left um you know sort of like a period where Bitcoin dominance still kind of wains for a little bit and maybe the best evidence for that is to go look at at the dominance excluding stable coins you look at the dominance excluding stable coins in 2019 you'll see a very similar pattern right as a series of lower highs and lower lows before we ultimately went up and swept the highs same thing over here right lower highs and lower lows and we've G we've gone on up and we swept the highs we talked about this many many times that's likely what's going to happen and everyone was like no it's a having year you don't know what you're talking about and here we are we put in a new high we actually saw Bitcoin dominance go to 57% which means that everyone who spent the last two and a half years calling the top on bitcoin dominance was once again wrong so we swept the high look what happened last time we swept the high dominance excluding Stables we did see dominance pull back a little bit um before then going back up and it actually pulled back in June right in June now this move here though was a lot more substantial right it actually went well above the high before getting a pullback these moves over here by dominance were a lot more substantial as well so if you do see a pullback here by Bitcoin dominance which you've actually already seen I mean you can see it's already pulled back a little bit I don't think it would be as big as this one because this trend over here is sort of like a miniature version of this one right it's sort of like a miniature version of it and I've tried to think like what would cause you know you know what could potentially continue to cause something like that and you know again it could be just SL to the devaluation of Bitcoin um where where Bitcoin kind of keeps going down a little bit and the altcoin market is is sort of holding because last week the altcoin market took a huge hit and so you know there's there's sort of some recovery going on over there um I don't know if that would be the reason or not but my base case is to not really give or not really care at all about that because who cares right I mean more than likely in two months the dominance is going to be much higher than where it is today okay I don't know if it's going to go back below 55% between now and then frankly I don't care I spent the last two and a half years dealing with trolls on Twitter telling me on every single Bitcoin dominance dump why I was wrong and again it just keeps on going higher so I wouldn't worry too much if there is a pullback in Bitcoin dominance I do think that it's going to go much higher into the summer at which point I think you could make a case that eth Bitcoin could maybe bottom out this summer right I'm thinking June at the earliest is my guess but again I'm you know subject to change that opinion I don't really have like a super strong opinion on it I just think if it were to play out like prior Cycles we saw that both prior Cycles when eth Bitcoin broke down it took about eight weeks for it to bottom so you know it if it took about 8 weeks again you see there was eight weeks here was about 8 weeks or so um if it if it were to take eight weeks that would essentially put it in in early to mid June which by the way is exactly when it bottomed out in 2022 so maybe this time is not different and it just bottoms out in the summer um I'm thinking June maybe July it kind of depends on on what eth Bitcoin does after the having the reason I say that is because you know after the spot ETF eth Bitcoin had this relief bounce um and it and made a lot of people sort of fomo back in right because it had this relief balance but I said it's probably just going to be a lower high and it was um and I even said this is probably going to be a lower high and it was and I was sort of just looking at the 2019 comparison a high and a lower high right it was It was kind of the same thing in the sense that you have this low you bounce off the low you put in a high you put in a lower high and then you go back down to low again and um we're kind of seeing that here kind of seeing that right here where you have your first low your first low and then your second low and your second low right and then you even had a third low before it got another bounce right the main difference though is here it's already broken support here it actually didn't so I don't really know that it has to get this bounce if it does I would expect it to get rejected at the bull market support band on weekly closes just like you got rejected over there that would currently correspond to about 053 to 054 again not really my base case um it it has already technically broken support and if you look at the trend over here in 2016 you can see that um after it came back down it it didn't really bounce much at all it just kind of kept on going down so base cases that eth Bitcoin continues to bleed base cases that Bitcoin dominance continues to go up um it's not a monotonic I mean it's not monotonic right it's a stochastic process so please be aware of that um I just think you know whatever happens the next week or two is kind of not that important it's more important what we think about in terms of going into into the summer so you know that is kind of where I am right now as far as Bitcoin you USD and sort of going back to the 8we estimate I I do imagine that if you don't go back to the 8we estimate and you just kind of get a larger drop like that that might cause the dominance to stall out for a little bit um but if you do get a relief rally kind of like what we saw in 2019 back to the 8we SME or even if it's like early 2021 back to the 8we S may I still think that that is where the Bitcoin dominance would go up a lot and if that were to play out then my guess is that you're just going to chop around up here for a little while until the dominance is around 60% and then once the dominance of Bitcoin hits 60% then Bitcoin USD Falls below its bull market support band just like it did over there and might say why 60% uh it's also a valid question there's a lot of different reasons why I think 60% uh the the fluffiest one which is not something I put a lot of weight into and actually I came up with 60% before even seeing this but if you look at the breakdown of Bitcoin dominance over here in 20 uh in the prior cycle from 17 over here you can see it rally back up to the 618 and if you take the breakdown from right here the 618 would actually put you at 60% the other way that I I I think you can look at it is if you look at the Bitcoin dominance excluding Stables onto trading view there's a wedge pattern here and the top of the wedge you know if it were to sort of continue would put it you know at around 64% uh if we just say what about where would it be by June you know you can see it be about 63% or so um or so that's no that's currently that's April if we go to to to June about 64% now it's currently 59% so that's another 5% move well coincidentally the Bitcoin dominance is at 55% so if it moves up 5% that gets you to 60% so I do think that dominance excluding Stables is likely going to go back up to the top of this wedge at which point it might be the top okay another way that you can look at it is to actually add in usdt dominance to the Bitcoin dominance and you will see that it also swept the high uh just like it did over here in 2019 right so you can see that it had a high it swept the high it had one last pullback and then it just went up so we had a high we we swept the high it looks kind of like we're in our pullback right now because the dominance excluded or the dominance of Bitcoin plus the dominance of usdt it went all the way up to around 62% and now it's back down to 60% so I mean it kind of looks like we're we're in this pullback right here but again my guess is that it's ultimately going to find a bottom and go much higher as we get into the summer okay so again you know if you're looking for a reason for why any of these alt coins might bounce against Bitcoin I would look towards something like that but it kind of looks like we've already had a lot of the move down and and altcoins are still not I mean Bitcoin dominance is still holding above 55% so um I don't you know I I I mean it might stall out here for a little bit but I do think it will uh continue to break through through there's a lot of other things that are kind of interesting when you look at Bitcoin USD that could give you some evidence of a potential local top for a little while one of which is if you take the FIB retracement tool from 2017 Peak and over and just sort of take that to the to the to the peak today uh you can see it actually topped out right at the 4.236 if you're like well this is great it's only hindsight guys I did a video like during the week where I pointed this out and and I I pointed it out because I found it interesting not necessarily to say that it you know it it has to be here but that back in 2019 or sorry back in 2021 Bitcoin only rallied back up to the 3618 right so here it rallied up to the 3618 and then it swept the high again it didn't make it to the 4.236 now it has made it to the 4.236 but you want to know what's actually fascinating about this is if you look at at at total market cap and you look at that same retracement tool you can see that in 2021 it made it to the 4.236 when Bitcoin didn't and what's even more fascinating is that now total only made it to the 3618 how crazy is that right so in 2021 Bitcoin was weaker than the altcoin market it only made it to the 3.61 a but in 2024 Bitcoin is stronger than the altcoin market as it went to the 4.236 whereas total only went has so far has only gone to 3618 what's different between here and here what's different between you know 2021 and 2024 monetary policy has changed a lot look at Bitcoin dominance where was Bitcoin dominance over here it was at like 40% and I said I said back in late 2021 early 2022 that Bitcoin dominance is is is entering a macro uptrend and it's likely going to go to 60% um and look at this look look what happened you know 3 years later almost exactly 3 years later at after at least this top here 3 years later Bitcoin is at the same price and the dominance is up from 40% to 55% right so I think you know this would be some evidence right I mean it's at least some evidence to suggest a summer low it doesn't have to happen even last summer I said that we could get a summer lull and I would still argue that it was a summer lull a lot of you guys might not remember it as such but when you think about it when we when we talked about a summer lull in I believe April um I mean it bled until June and then it I mean it literally got a one week pump for the most part and then it just bled again until September so I mean to me that is a summer L right I mean not a lot happened the market was relatively boring I think the market could very well be boring this summer as well so that's you know some more evidence of it the main thing that I go back to is you know there's there's three things and we've talked about a lot of them we talking about them forever so unless you're new here you should already know what I'm going to say we know that in 2019 there was two things that marked the top that marked the transition from risk on to risk off one was the the breakdown of eth Bitcoin and again it was it was one of the sources of liquidity and it and it got taken away to some degree as eth Bitcoin broke down and when eth Bitcoin broke broke down it marked a local top by Bitcoin so here you're looking at a very similar thing where eth Bitcoin is breaking down and it potentially marked a local top for Bitcoin it's not just eth Bitcoin though it's also gold if you look at gold if you overlay gold onto this chart you will see basically the same thing when did Bitcoin go from risk on to risk offl back in 2019 it was actually exactly when gold broke out right you see gold right here it broke about above these prior highs that marked the the top for Bitcoin and when did gold break out it didn't break out in April it actually broke out in March precisely basically when Bitcoin is put in its local top which also is about a month before the having which is when eth topped out about a month before the merge now of course eth continued to go higher later on but it had a period where it it it cooled off quite a lot going into the next few months so that that's more evidence and then of course the other one that we've talked about is usdt dominance if you look at usdt dominance take a look at this trend line I've been pointing it out forever as well um I did a whole video on usdt dominance back over here and I said look there's a good chance it's going to go from 6% down to 4% and it did and it's was accompanied by continued Bitcoin rally but the issue is that with usdt dominance is that every time it has hit this line it has marked a larger pullback in the market it marked a larger pullback starting in December 2017 even in November 2018 it was just before Bitcoin dropped quite a bit June 2019 was the the midcycle top back in the last cycle right before rate Cuts began February 2020 I shouldn't explained that one March 2021 November 2021 March 2024 and we hit this trend line again now where we you know where you you might get potentially thrown off is in March of 2021 we hit this trend line and we kind of kept tagging it throughout April and even into May so if you were to get some type of relief bounce you you could actually see us go tag that trend line again but I you know every single time we've tagged this trend line we had to see sort of a a a reallocation of capital for a while where people took profits there was a lull in the market and then after kind of consolidating there for a while um we saw USD Dom start to go back up and there's actually a similar Trend right if you look at the bullmark sport band you'll see a lot of times there's this like there's this move where you you you sort of go down you go back up get rejected by the 20 we and then you go back down to it right here you go down you go back up get rejected by the 20we SMA and then you go down to it same thing go down go back up get rejected by the 20we SMA and then you go back down to the trend line so we've seen this happen many many times now the next question you might have is why are you only looking at usdt dominance why not look at usdt dominance as well it's a fair question and so we'll just add it in and you can see that if you add that in it gives you basically the same thing I mean it's kind of a rounding error I mean qualitatively it's the same thing so I think maybe this is the area to look at right here because it is now at the bull market support band um so I mean it depends on if it breaks through or not if you get a relief rally back up to the 8we SMA then it would be a rejection off this in the short term if you don't get a relief rally back up to 8we estim and it just plays out like November late November 2021 and you say go straight back down to the bullmark SM band or something then then it just then the USD dominance just sort of breaks through so a lot of things to consider and by the way in in um in this entire bull market all these pullbacks have only been about 20 to 22% pullbacks right so 20% pullback 20% pullback right all of these have been 20% pullbacks and so you know there's going to be some people right that are going to think that it's just going to be another 20% pullback which means that you know if you do see it at 58k 59k I'm sure people are going to bid it up because this what they been doing and they could be right right I maybe that's what leads to a relief rally in the market but note that when eth Bitcoin broke down in 2019 it finally led to a larger drop in the market to the tune of 30% and really the market had dropped before that relief rally occurred had dropped around 34% which was much more significant than any of the other drops that had currently seen about 18% um you know 14% so I mean you know what happens if it plays out like late 2021 where you don't really get a relief rally and it just goes back down to the bull market sport band I mean if you get something like that you know a a 30 a a 26% drop gets you back to the bull market sport band right the problem is that normally when you go this long without testing it you could argue that we're too far gone to hold it as support and therefore you get a summer lull right you get this period where it just sort of goes back below it it happened there it also happened back over here and you can see here it took 24 weeks to get to the back to the below the 20we estim here it took 32 weeks we are currently on week 26 so we are in between this one and this one I've said before I think this move here is a combination of this one and this one because 2019 was during quantitative tightening and high rates the secondary move over here was during QE we put in a new all-time high though so just kind of like over here we put in a new alltime high so a lot of different things right you can look at um to sort of look at this move and the the reason why I I still remain very you know pessimistic about all Bitcoin pairs is because if you look at at 2019 during this period right here that's where all Bitcoin pairs mostly put in their bottoms it was when you know Bitcoin kind of chopped around for a little bit during this phase and so if it does something like that then I think all Bitcoin pairs might bottom out somewhere in that in that range right somewhere in that zone as as Bitcoin just continues to chop the altcoin market up for a few months I think that's where you might actually see altcoins bottom against Bitcoin um at least the ones that are going to and and Bitcoin dominance top out but I think we're too early in this trend for that to be the case just yet I think that the the Bitcoin is going to continue to chop the altcoin market up for probably at least another month or two um before that is the case and you know I do think there's a lot of evidence who support that as I've been talking about quite expensively in this video if you\n",

      "The video transcript provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, and potential scenarios going forward. The key points are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The video examines the behavior of the 8-week exponential moving average (8WE SMA) and its significance as a support level for Bitcoin. The presenter notes that a weekly close below this level would be a significant milestone and discusses past instances where Bitcoin has reacted after falling below the 8WE SMA.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The presenter compares the current Bitcoin rally to previous rallies in 2019 and 2021, highlighting similarities in the market dynamics. He suggests that the market's reaction to a potential weekly close below the 8WE SMA could be similar to what was observed in 2019, where Bitcoin had a relief rally but Ethereum's performance (measured by the ETH/BTC pair) continued to decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The analysis suggests that the current market environment, characterized by the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening, is different from the 2021 scenario, where the Fed was expanding its balance sheet. This difference in monetary policy is expected to have an impact on the performance of the ETH/BTC pair, potentially leading to a decline rather than a rally.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The presenter acknowledges that there is no guarantee of a relief rally, and even if one occurs, it does not necessarily mean that altcoins will benefit. He cites examples from 2019 where Bitcoin rallies did not translate into gains for altcoins, as Bitcoin's strength continued to weigh on the altcoin market.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The overall sentiment of the transcript is cautious and bearish, as the presenter suggests that the current market conditions, particularly the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, are not favorable for altcoins and that Bitcoin dominance is likely to continue increasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The presenter provides additional insights and analysis, including the potential for a \"summer lull\" in the cryptocurrency market, similar to what was observed in 2019 and 2021. He examines various indicators, such as Bitcoin dominance excluding stablecoins, the relationship between Bitcoin and gold, and the behavior of USDT dominance, to support his bearish outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The presenter acknowledges the possibility of a relief rally, but cautions that it may not necessarily lead to a sustained recovery in the altcoin market. He suggests that the altcoin market may continue to underperform Bitcoin, and that Bitcoin dominance could reach levels around 60% before a more significant pullback occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the main message of the transcript is that the current cryptocurrency market environment, characterized by the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening, is likely to be unfavorable for altcoins, and Bitcoin dominance may continue to rise, even in the face of potential relief rallies. The presenter provides a comprehensive analysis and a cautious, bearish outlook on the market's near-term prospects.\n",

      "that's where you might actually see altcoins bottom against Bitcoin um at least the ones that are going to and and Bitcoin dominance top out but I think we're too early in this trend for that to be the case just yet I think that the the Bitcoin is going to continue to chop the altcoin market up for probably at least another month or two um before that is the case and you know I do think there's a lot of evidence who support that as I've been talking about quite expensively in this video if you look at individual altcoins they really mimic that 2019 move a lot more than they would the 2020 move I mean there's a lot of great examples of that if you look just at ethereum if you just look at eth and I did a whole video on this previously but you kind of have this this wedge here and it it looks like it's playing out in a very similar fashion right where you have this wedge you break above it and then after eth Bitcoin breaks down eth you USD falls back through the wedge so eth Bitcoin broke down right here after it broke down eth USD fell through the wedge eth Bitcoin just broke down here and now it looks like ethusd is potentially falling into the wedge it doesn't mean you can't get a relief rally and a lower high but I do think there's a case we made that it's going to go back into that wedge um and if you look at other altcoins that are even riskier you have things like Ada and if you look at this one I mean this move does look very similar at least at this point to this one right here right I mean if you look closely I mean it it almost looks like a a carbon copy of this sort of this double you know this double Peak move right here if you just sort of overlay it you can see it it I mean it looks really really similar and when Ada USD was falling right there it also happened to correspond to when adaa Bitcoin was breaking support right Ada Bitcoin broke support right there which is when a a USD capitulated back down to the range low right here if you look at it over here you can see that ADA Bitcoin broke support right here which is precisely when Ada USD capitulated back to the range low right there so it's all very similar right it's all very similar the main difference this time is that rate cuts are occurring basically a year later than they occurred in the prior cycle it doesn't mean that it's not playing out it just is taking a long time for us to see the whole thing play out but it's there right I mean it is there if you look for it um I I do feel like you can see it playing out and the reality is that the altcoin Reckoning was always based on all Bitcoin valuations and if and if e Bitcoin is putting in new lows which it is and if Ada Bitcoin is putting in new lows which it is this is a trend line that everyone said was going to hold my loudest critics in the cardano community told me that I was clueless for saying that adaa Bitcoin would go below 800 sets because they said this trend line was going to hold and I said many many times it's not going to hold and it's nothing against them it's nothing against cardano it's just monetary policy right I mean don't take it up with me go take it up with Jerome Powell it's just monetary policy and you can see that it has fallen below it and it's probably going to go to 400 stats um dot Bitcoin is putting in new lows right and the reality madic Bitcoin you know putting in new lows the reality if if all these altcoins are putting in new lows and the altcoin Reckoning was about the devaluation of altcoins against Bitcoin then it means the altcoin Reckoning is not over if all these alts are putting in new lows so that's where we are right and you know the the tough less than learned last cycle was that if alt Bitcoin pairs can put in new lows alt USD pairs can put in new lows I I saw that happen with many altcoins last cycle so don't tell me it can't happen it can I saw it happen last cycle if you have a problem with that just go look at what happened last cycle with a lot of altcoins Bitcoin has the luxury it is so much higher up than the altcoin market right I mean it could drop right it could drop from here could drop 65% and be at 25k which is still well above the prior low right what happens if if eth drops 65% it's still going to be above the prior low but you're not that much further above it right I mean you're you're at $1,400 right which would actually look very similar to this one right here where ethusd fell back to slightly above this higher low right so you had a low and then a higher low here you have a low and then a higher low right I mean it would it would get you sort of close to that range um where it found this low a little bit higher than that right right around $1,400 right so kind of looks really similar right it kind of looks really similar and but the issue is that in the altcoin market you can't say the same because if if if something like a were to drop 65% from these highs it's back down to the lows and the issue for Ada is that it's bleeding on his Bitcoin pair so if Bitcoin were to drop 65% then Ada is probably down 80% so that's how altcoins can put in new lows after you know once rate Cuts arrive or even you know because they they're already not even that far off their lows so if you get a more substantial correction on bitcoin whether it's 65% you know whether it's 57% or whether it's a more minor correction alt can put in new lows because they're not that far off their lows to begin with if you were to look at like madic I mean is it is it really that far off its low I mean it would only be a 55% drop just to get it back to its low there's just so many things that you can look at that that show very clearly why the altcoin market has been so risky compared to bitcoin it doesn't mean that some haven't outperformed I said that two years ago I I said it 2 and a half years ago that some out for Bitcoin even though Bitcoin dominance is going to go up and that's exactly what happened and every single day I have messages from people saying you know you said not to buy alts and this altcoin outperform Bitcoin you know they would have been some micro cap meme coin can go yeah sure it can outperform Bitcoin most of the coins from last cycle are still putting in lower highs against Bitcoin that's the fact that's the fact so I stand by it I mean I stand by it it it was not wrong to be bullish on bitcoin dominance it was not wrong to be bearish on E Bitcoin it wasn't wrong to be bearish on any Bitcoin or any of these altcoins against Bitcoin for the most part the ones that people point to are they're cherry-picking the low because most of them are still putting in lower highs against Bitcoin and the ones that are not for the most part are new altcoins that don't have the baggage from the prior cycle which by the way is what I said would happen that the ones that are likely going to go up against Bitcoin are going to be your newer altcoins that don't have that baggage now that we look back on it after all this time and you're looking at a 62 ,000 Bitcoin and everyone is scared it's only 62k I mean it could drop I mean even if it were to Rally back up to the 8we SMA or even go above it I mean it could drop all the way back down here and it's still doing pretty well all things considered I mean imagine you know if you bought Bitcoin in late 2022 which by the way on ITC premium I said I was doing despite what anyone wants to say receipts are there even if it were to drop back to 42k you're still up 164% now the people that bought it up here would be pissed off because they're down 44% but you're still doing well the issue is that was there ever a time where it would have been made more sense being in in a collective basket of altcoins over Bitcoin in that case and and I would say no because if Bitcoin were to drop back down here let's say 58% you know where's total three where would total three be I mean 58% puts you back at the lows right it just simply puts you back at the lows that's the issue for the altcoin market is that Bitcoin has the luxury of getting a larger pullback and still being pretty you know up a lot the altcoin market doesn't have that same luxury and that's how altcoins can put in new lows you might say well this time is different guys we saw the altcoin market put in new lows in the having year last cycle now it was induced by a pandemic but at the end of the day it was a recession and you can't tell me there's no risk of that I'm not saying it has to happen you could have a soft Landing but we've had an inverted yiel curve for an extremely long period of time and it could theoretically happen the unemployment rate is curling up in fact if you go look at the unemployment rate anytime it goes above the bullmark S band for the most part I mean it's just it just keeps on going up right and we're above it I mean look at all these times I have them highlighted so it could happen it doesn't have to be induced by by a pandemic but maybe it's just induced by you know 2 and a half years of of Tighter and Tighter monetary policy um so that's how it could theoretically happen and I saw it happen last cycle you know I don't care what the excuse was you know at the end of the day you're always going to come up with a reason like why doesn't matter if it was caused by a pandemic all that mattered was that I DC into altcoins throughout this entire phase and I would have just been better off with Bitcoin that was the reality of the situation I can blame it on whatever the hell I want to blame it on but the reality was that I could have just been with stuck with Bitcoin and I would have been much better off there was never a time where it made sense to be in the collective altcoin Market over Bitcoin basically throughout this entire phase but then once QE came back and the last rate cut arrived then you bet your sweet you know what it made sense to be bullish on the eth Bitcoin valuation which I was which I was and actually I turned bullish on the E Bitcoin valuation at 0.02 in 2019 which is where it ultimately carved out of bottom but that's why I say I mean it's really not that complicated if if you're bullish on bitcoin dominance three of the four years in the cycle you're probably doing something right altcoins really only durably rally against Bitcoin for like one year of the cycle look at Bitcoin dominance really I mean look at look at Bitcoin dominance and you look to see when these all seasons occur where Bitcoin dominance is crashing it it really only lasts about a year and then we spend the next three years dreaming of va season right it lasts for about a year and then you spend the next three years dreaming of va season and then by the time that I convince the last of you that the Bitcoin dominance is likely going to 60% that's when it finally tops out when the last person capitulates their alt to bitcoin when the last person stops telling me that eth is holding up well against Bitcoin because it's not and it hasn't been then every time I say that it's going lower I get trolls all over X telling me why I'm wrong and they've been bullish on it for the last 2 and 1/2 years it's easy to call the bottom on something over and over and over again because eventually you will be right and it's not cool to be bullish on bitcoin dominance when most people here only care about altcoins so what they do is they just keep on calling the bottom on it on each Bitcoin and they keep calling the top on bitcoin dominance day after day after day they laugh at anyone who disagrees with them and then when it when when Bitcoin dominance goes up they call the top on it again when e Bitcoin goes down they call the bottom on it again they'll eventually be right my guess is they're going to be right when we go to 03 to 04 for E Bitcoin my guesses are going to be right when we go to 60% Bitcoin dominance and that I think is ultimately where the top for Bitcoin dominance could be one crazy thing about this is if you add in usdt dominance you will see that we're not that far off of where we were back over here I mean back over here when we broke the Range High was at 64% here it's at like 62% ultimately what happened after that is that you know from here it would rally up all the way up to 75% right maybe it goes a little bit lower 73% this is both Bitcoin dominance and usct dominance but you can see like it's not we could get there if you were to look at Bitcoin dominance plus eth dominance look at this it's an oscillator because it doesn't matter how many tens of thousands of mem coins you print there's no more money coming into them the money is just being diverted from one meme coin to 10,000 so dominance isn't going to go down just because you print another 10,000 meme coins it just means that each meme coin is going to become a little less relevant because there's so many more of them so blue chip dominance is an oscillator where it goes basically between 58 57% up to around 79 80% and right now it's around 72% I think it's going to go all the way up here here to around 80% meaning another 8% move by Bitcoin plus eth dominance that's my guess about another 8% move or so it doesn't have to be quite that high I could see a case um where you have slightly lower highs um but I I still think it's it's going to go it's going to make a run here um so that would be something to look at as well and again if you look at like all Bitcoin pairs the only not really sure if it's going to see any more relief from here or not if they do my guess is they get rejected off of the bullmark sport pen right so you can see right here they had this sort of this relief move back up before getting rejected and going down um off the bullmark sport ban You could argue we already had that move although it did go above the 20we estimate so I'm not really that sure um again if it were to do something like this it would it would correspond to the the the Bitcoin dominance plus usdt do sort of getting getting this pull back before going up right but again this cycle we've seen things not as um you know they haven't been as spectacular in fact if you were to get a bar pattern of this it might actually be interesting to Overlay this and and you compress it right so if you kind of like compress it down it would you know it would look something like that right I might need to even compress it a little bit more um but it would look something like that where you're sort of you're in the pullback right now where maybe it goes down a little bit more but then I I think it just shoots up into into the summer you know and again trying to think about what would cause it to go down I again I I I do wonder if if a larger pullback by Bitcoin would cause it to go down um but I mean even that doesn't really make a whole lot of sense because this is usdt dominance so if Bitcoin goes down then usdt dominance is theoretically going up so it could be theoretically a Bitcoin bounce where altcoins outperform but again that's not really my base case and if they do outperform I I think it would be extremely short-lived because in 2019 during High interest rates and quantitative tightening on the relief rally Bitcoin dominance went up not down so that's my base case is that all Bitcoin pairs break down Bitcoin dominance breaks up into the summer months um potentially topping out in maybe June or July you know around the maybe around the First Rate cut I don't know exactly but um this whole process has been taking a lot longer than I thought so I'm not going to you know say for sure when I think it's going to top out but I do think it's ultimately going to go um up a little bit more um probably up to you know this is you know Bitcoin dominance plus usdt dominance probably up to you know 74 75% as a high but I I could see it not going that High I mean I could see it going only to like 70% or something this is with this is not just Bitcoin dominance this is also usdt dominance remember so if you add in if you just look at usdt dominance it's currently at you know 5% it it was at 4% not that long ago so I mean if it were to go back up to 8% or something right I mean that's a 3% that you're adding on to bitcoin dominance is 5% that gets you 8% um and that can kind of get you there so definitely lot of things to think about Bitcoin having is coming up really soon so if the Bulls are going to get above the 8we ese this week it's got to be because the they bid it up into the having they haven't been able to do that so far and so if they can't do it by the end of the week and we do get that Weekly close below the 8we ese I I think that next week is the key week to look at because you either get this rally like early 2021 or early or mid 2019 back to the 8we or you just don't get it and it just can you know just capitulates again into a pretty large a pretty large drop and if it were to get something like that then you would essentially find yourself back at the at the bull Mark support band at around 53 54k or so so that's what I'm essentially looking at right now um there's a thousand different other things we could we could think about and and I mean I could of course tie it into to the long of the yield curve um to the dollar the dollar is in a rally I said going into the I said many times going into the summer I think this is going to form a higher low and go higher into the summer the reason that's an issue for alts is because as liquidity gets sort of taken out as as the dollar goes up you get the devaluation of other currencies against the US dollar the personing power goes down all it's bleed to bitcoin highrisk assets bleed to lowrisk assets during this dxy rally over here we saw the Bitcoin dominance go up a lot and I'm guessing we're just going to see the same thing happen once again so those are my views on on bitcoin right now I I mean I I I suppose it's always worthwhile to to look at at other things like for instance uh year-to-date Roi of Bitcoin in 2024 compared to say 20121 and um and 2017 and kind of see that I mean if you look at at 29 or at um 2021 since we were making that comparison I mean you can kind of see some similarities here um and so let's see if it if it gets that sort of a lower high in May or not uh because if it does get that if it gets a lower high in May then it might sort of make people think all right we are in fact getting a a summer low the biggest case to suggest that I'm wrong would be that if we are getting a a left translated cycle um where we just kind of keep rallying on up into the summer again it's not my based case uh it really isn't but there's a lot of people that are talking about it still and um who am I to say that it can't happen if you take the ROI from the peak measured it from April instead of November you can see that we are kind of right where we were at this point last cycle so I wouldn't completely dismiss that view you might say well Ben that goes against everything you just said guess what I don't trade everything I just said I've just been Bitcoin heavy for a long time I converted my alts to Bitcoin in early 2022 I converted my e to Bitcoin in 2022 between mostly 07 to 8 and some a little above 8 and I bought Bitcoin at the lows with USD as published in ITC premium that's what I did I sold a little bit of Bitcoin in 24 that's what I I sold some Bitcoin in 2024 as I mentioned but I didn't sell any in 2023 so how do you navigate it if you get a left translated top well I mean you have some Bitcoin right I mean because guess what no matter what happens Bitcoin dominance goes up it gives you exposure to the upside it minimizes your downside risk that's the view that's been the view for like the last two and a half years it gives you exposure to the upside it minimizes your downside risk it doesn't mean that Bitcoin is not going to crash at some point it probably will in fact if you go look at the days since the last time Bitcoin had a drop um since it had a 30% drop\n",

      "\n",
      "The video transcript provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, and potential scenarios going forward. The key points are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The video examines the behavior of the 8-week exponential moving average (8WE SMA) and its significance as a support level for Bitcoin. The presenter notes that a weekly close below this level would be a significant milestone and discusses past instances where Bitcoin has reacted after falling below the 8WE SMA.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The presenter compares the current Bitcoin rally to previous rallies in 2019 and 2021, highlighting similarities in the market dynamics. He suggests that the market's reaction to a potential weekly close below the 8WE SMA could be similar to what was observed in 2019, where Bitcoin had a relief rally but Ethereum's performance (measured by the ETH/BTC pair) continued to decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The analysis suggests that the current market environment, characterized by the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening, is different from the 2021 scenario, where the Fed was expanding its balance sheet. This difference in monetary policy is expected to have an impact on the performance of the ETH/BTC pair, potentially leading to a decline rather than a rally.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The presenter acknowledges that there is no guarantee of a relief rally, and even if one occurs, it does not necessarily mean that altcoins will benefit. He cites examples from 2019 where Bitcoin rallies did not translate into gains for altcoins, as Bitcoin's strength continued to weigh on the altcoin market.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The overall sentiment of the transcript is cautious and bearish, as the presenter suggests that the current market conditions, particularly the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, are not favorable for altcoins and that Bitcoin dominance is likely to continue increasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The presenter provides additional insights and analysis, including the potential for a \"summer lull\" in the cryptocurrency market, similar to what was observed in 2019 and 2021. He examines various indicators, such as Bitcoin dominance excluding stablecoins, the relationship between Bitcoin and gold, and the behavior of USDT dominance, to support his bearish outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The presenter acknowledges the possibility of a relief rally, but cautions that it may not necessarily lead to a sustained recovery in the altcoin market. He suggests that the altcoin market may continue to underperform Bitcoin, and that Bitcoin dominance could reach levels around 60% before a more significant pullback occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. The presenter discusses the potential impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, noting that if the bulls are unable to push Bitcoin above the 8WE SMA by the end of the current week, the following week could be crucial in determining the market's direction. He suggests that a failure to rally above the 8WE SMA could lead to a capitulation and a larger drop towards the bull market support band around $53-54k.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. The presenter also examines the relationship between the US dollar index (DXY) and the cryptocurrency market, noting that a rally in the US dollar typically leads to a devaluation of other currencies against the US dollar, which can negatively impact high-risk assets like altcoins and benefit low-risk assets like Bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. The presenter acknowledges that while a \"left-translated\" market cycle, where the market continues to rally into the summer, is a possibility, it is not his base case. He emphasizes that his strategy has been to maintain a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio, converting his altcoin holdings to Bitcoin in early 2022 and selectively buying Bitcoin at the lows, as he believes this approach minimizes downside risk and provides exposure to the upside potential of Bitcoin.\n",

      "you have some Bitcoin right I mean because guess what no matter what happens Bitcoin dominance goes up it gives you exposure to the upside it minimizes your downside risk that's the view that's been the view for like the last two and a half years it gives you exposure to the upside it minimizes your downside risk it doesn't mean that Bitcoin is not going to crash at some point it probably will in fact if you go look at the days since the last time Bitcoin had a drop um since it had a 30% drop I mean it's been 526 days I mean come on guys it's going to drop 30% at some point it's been a long time it's probably going to happen and and when it does um everyone's going to act like they could have never seen it coming you know but it's been a long time since it happened um and I mean it sort of seems like like we're getting close to one um but again that doesn't mean it has to materialize immediately you could see some relief here and there I just think that no matter what happens going into the summer the Bitcoin dominance goes up whether it means bitcoin's going down or up there's a good chance it's doing both right there's a good chance it's going up and down and sort of chopping around for a while and the altcoins get eaten alive by Bitcoin they just because they can't catch a B during such monetary policy and there's so many of them that the money gets spread out it's too thin the order books are too thin so when Bitcoin sells off the altcoin market because they broke down in their Bitcoin pairs during Bitcoin rallies they have nowhere to hide when Bitcoin dumps so you have to think about a lot of those different things um as you navigate this market for me it has always been a Bitcoin heavy portfolio make sure you keep some cash in case in case you know something really bad happens and or or if it just plays out like 2019 where it it sort of just finds a local top and we just sort of slowly Trend down for a while right I think it's worthwh to have some cash if that happens um and the way you can be hedged is you could also have some Bitcoin in case I'm wrong and and I have some Bitcoin in case I'm wrong right I mean it I I think a lot of people forget that right and I've said that for years but I put out views about what I think I have some Bitcoin in case I'm wrong wrong because you know if Bitcoin goes to 100K I'm going to be sad I didn't have more but at least I had some but again I'm going to express my views those are my views e Bitcoin broke down gold broke out the main thing that is providing me a little hesitation is that all Bitcoin pairs still haven't technically broken down and so I'm not really sure if that means there's still that more liquidity that Bitcoin can take from the altcoin market but that is something to keep an eye on they still haven't technically broken down and so that still I think theoretically needs to happen but anyways we'll go ahead and wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at inth crypt.of\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse the eth Bitcoin ratio has fallen if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom links in the description below we have a website with thousands of charts for hundreds of different cryptocurrencies so make sure you guys check that out again the sale will end at after the having let's go Ahad and jump in so the eth Bitcoin ratio is something that I have been tracking about as long as my channel has been around I find the eth Bitcoin ratio really useful in terms of navigating various phases of the market cycle if you have an edge on where you think think e Bitcoin on where e Bitcoin is going to go then theoretically you have an edge on where then Bitcoin dominance is going to go and how to adjust your portfolio to maximize your risk adjusted returns we have just had a major event happen in the cryptoverse but I think it is largely gone unnoticed so far but I do think it will become more evident in the coming weeks so this video is going to first go through the eth Bitcoin ratio and my prior views on it we will then talk about the implications on you know the USD valuation of eth and then finally I will talk a little bit about a potential path for eth Bitcoin to finally bottom out so before we get too far into this you know one of the things that inevitably happens when I post these videos is you know the the Bitcoin Maxi talk comes out they just say oh he's just a Bitcoin Maxi but let me just go through you know a few of my prior thoughts in the video are on on on eth bitcoin so I actually the the first video you will find on my channel the first two in fact are primarily on the eth Bitcoin valuation here's one here's the first one this is the oldest video on my channel e ethereum timing the longterm momentum shifts we are in a very strong by region so so in the video I talk about how eth Bitcoin was significantly undervalued at 02 and that it was a strong by region and that we were likely going to spend the next sever several years seeing the eth Bitcoin valuation go up I Then followed it up in my next video where I said it I just made the title eth Bitcoin is severely undervalued you can see that right before ethereum takes off you know at least in the last cycle it likes to hug this 20we moving average for a bit and that's what we're so we were making all the same comparisons for the prior cycle and talking about how it was likely going to enter into a major uptrend so it's important for me to say this because inevitably whenever I post a video on the eth Bitcoin valuation what people will say is that zoom out you know and and look at the chart and and they sort of point out these higher lows and my only point you know is that it's a market right and yes I was I was bullish on it over here but just like anything in the market nothing ever goes straight up straight up nothing goes straight down it's okay to Pivot your view if the market changes and so then I pivoted my view when we started to notice that ethereum's Bitcoin valuation was looking awfully similar similar to the Bitcoin USD woff distribution so why are we talking about this well the problem is that you could argue the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is so is showing some similarities right these so we talk about how the eth Bitcoin valuation was showing similarities to the Bitcoin USD wof distribution woff distribution and this was when it was at 073 now after that we saw it collapse all the way down 2.05 this collapse is actually a very common collapse that happens between two major Peaks so if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about look at the eth Bitcoin valuations weekly candles and you will see a very familiar pattern that has happened now a third time and is in the process of of still happening and that pattern namely is that you get a Peak you then set a low you then get a slightly lower high you then come back down to the low spend some months trying to hold it as support but ultimately you fail and then we go into final capitulation that lasts for two or three months you will see the same thing happened over here you set a peak you set a low then you set a secondary Peak where it is a lower high you come back down to the low you try to hold it for a few months but you fail to and then you capitulate for two to three months before setting the bottom the same thing has happened once again where you have a peak you set a low you then set a secondary Peak that's a lower high you then bleed back down to the low and you try to hold it for a few months but you fail and then you bleed below that that low and then you capitulate for a few months this is the general Trend the general path that the eth Bitcoin valuation takes and so in this video when we talked about this this distribution phase what ended up happening is we did go back down we went down we set a low then we went right back up to set a secondary distribution phase we can see similarities in these two charts for instance you not only do you have the wof distribution phase but you also have this this potential double top that's occurr so we talked about how the E Bitcoin valuation back then was essentially mimicking the Bitcoin USD secondary distribution phase where it had a double top in late 2021 right so you can see that it had these four tops and then a double top over here sort of your one two p and then it bled back down to the range lows tried to hold it and then once it failed to hold it it capitulated and we said back then that it looks like the same thing is happening where eth Bitcoin had a secondary distribution phase right you had your first distribution phase here and then a secondary distribution phase up here where you have your little one2 top bleed back down to the range lows and then finally capitulate just like Bitcoin USD capitulated here in June of 2022 so this whole process that we've been talking about has been playing out but it's been playing out over a very long period of time so we started off with saying timing this long-term momentum shift at at at 0.02 saying it's severely undervalued at 0.0019 or whatever it was at here then acknowledging look it looks like a distribution phase up at Point 73 and then at the merge when it was at 0083 saying look this looks to be like a secondary distribution phase do you guys remember what it was like at the merge all the eth Maxis were calling for the flipping some of them were calling for it to double up bitcoin's market cap it was absolutely delusional right and every step of the way I mean every throughout this entire process we've seen nothing but lower high after lower high and every time that it happens it draws more people back in it leads to a lot of like taunting and mocking but they've all just been lower highs right they've all just been lower highs and now after watching eth Bitcoin bleed for two and a half years from this high it has finally broken support this is a major milestone in the crypto verse for those who care to pay attention to it I wish I had paid closer attention to it in Prior Cycles now there's something we have to talk about here okay and that is what are the implications of it going forward and what are the implications of it on its USD valuation because while I have tried to spend hours and hours and hours convincing people that the Bitcoin valuation of these cryptocurrencies is the only thing that matters I've failed at convincing everyone and so a lot of people still do care about its USD evaluation and I'm not going to necessarily I mean I will provide my opinion but I'm just going to show you what happened the last two times that e Bitcoin closed below this major support level it's happened twice before okay it happened here in November of October of 2016 October November of 2016 and then it happened over here in June July of 2019 so it's happened two times before what did ethusd do during that time so if you were to Overlay ethusd onto this chart what we're going to do is just say what did it do after the breakdown occurred okay So Below when it when it went first below the range low from this Wick right here so you can see that it went below the range low in October of 2016 if we zoom in we can maybe see it a little bit closer so you can see it right right here it went below the range low in October of 2016 when it went below the range low in October of 2016 you can see that October was down 18% November it was down 21.5% and then December it went down 5. 6% by the week by the monthly close however the whole move here from October through December Sal ethusd dropped 54% 54% all right that's one example now following that drop we know what happened next right this is one example by the way in this example when ethusd dropped Bitcoin actually went up if you were to Overlay Bitcoin USD onto this chart you'll see that Bitcoin didn't really care about what eth was doing during that time it just went up okay now look at the second time this happened where eth Bitcoin fell below support it happened in July of 2019 now what happened to ethusd starting then well you can see that on this USD pair at dropped out 1 month before and then it bled down 75% now I know what you're thinking that was a pandemic drop that caused it to drop 75% I would say it gives you insight into what could happen if a recession occurs right regardless of what triggers it whether it's a Black Swan or whether it's just a slow long progression of the yield curve and all that stuff if we ignore that let's just suppose we get a landing and there's no recession right which is a big assumption but let's just for a minute suppose that that's true even in that case even before the pandemic was a thing eth still dropped 68% from the highs when eth Bitcoin broke down so you have two examples of eth breaking down and really measured from this top here in September it actually dropped around 60% so you have two examples where when eth Bitcoin broke down as measured from the previous local top on ethusd eth dropped 60% if you actually take it from this top over here you can see it was closer to a 72% drop and this one remember was about a 75% drop so what do you notice when eth Bitcoin breaks down it has never been good for ethusd even when Bitcoin went up now in the second case over here Bitcoin actually went down right so so in this case Bitcoin went down in 2019 in 2016 Bitcoin went up so what does that show you it shows you that no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD Bitcoin dominance went up during those times and eth Bitcoin went down e Bitcoin went down and so the question is is what does that mean this time because so many people out there right and I I it's almost scary how how how many people are saying it right so many people out there are Shilling memes and and outright scams and they're being paid to do it and they do it over and over and over again and their followers follow them and they get wrecked and then they just keep on doing it because there's always some other 100x gem that they're going to recommend that they were paid to recommend okay now for a while people just assume it's okay and that nothing is nothing bad is happening but this is a major event that eth Bitcoin has fallen it's a major event and I think not enough people are are paying attention to it they're focused on other things they're focused on the the latest meme coin craze they're rationalizing why their altcoins are down 30 to 40% over the last couple of weeks this is a major event I know it's a meme guy I me get it I get it but if you look at the logarithmic regression trend line for eth fit to to non-bubble data you will see that after eth Bitcoin broke down here and here eusd went to the lower logarithmic regression trend line or home if you will that's what happened and I can't help but wonder why should this time be any different because as we saw over here eth USD dropped from the local high 72% over here even if you don't worry about the pandemic it still dropped about 66 67% if you include the recession 73 or 72% or so if you take this from here from 4K a 70% drop puts you exactly at the fair value logarithmic aggression trend line that's where it would put ethereum and I don't know why we should assume this time is any different one thing to consider is that you know I know a lot of people are talking about a left translated cycle and so as I've said before I'm not completely unsympathetic to that view I'm not but I don't for for me I still think if you want exposure to crypto I I think Bitcoin makes more sense than ethereum right now now that doesn't mean that Bitcoin can't collapse I think it probably will get a pretty big drop um at at some point especially as as the yield curve un inverts but I don't know exactly when that's going to be um we do know that last cycle Bitcoin topped out about a month before the First Rate cut I know the First Rate cut is getting priced further and further out but I think that the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in I've explained what I mean by that before I really want to spend a ton of time explaining that again so ethusd potentially is starting to turn the corner here and what's actually fascinating about ethusd when you look at it on its USD pair when it broke down against Bitcoin last time the pattern is almost identical we have this wedge that ethusd broke out of right we have this wedge ethusd broke out of it topped eth Bitcoin broke down right there eth USD then fell back through the wedge right it fell back through the wedge now look at it over here it's the same thing you have a wedge that ethusd was in for a long time and now eth Bitcoin has broken down ethusd is starting to correct and it looks like it's potentially going to correct right through the wedge just like it did over here which by the way occurred as those rate Cuts finally arrived so I don't really care what the CME Market tool thing is is showing for when rate cuts are going to occur I look at this and say if this keeps on dropping like this it represents a consumer that is starting to falter and therefore it will likely not take until November or September for a rate cut I could see a rate cut coming this Summer Okay so this pattern to me looks like it's playing out once again I have said forever that after eth Bitcoin breaks down we will likely see ethusd fall back through this wedge to me it looks like it is finally happening so I think that it makes a lot of sense to view the market view ethusd through the lens of eth Bitcoin and the reason for that is over the last two and a half years if you wanted exposure to crypto then you have to figure out what you're going to buy and of course if you're if you're a full Deen and you're you're buying micro cap stuff you're probably not really interested in what I have to say anyways but if you're not as risky if you don't want to take on as much risk um if you're dealing with say a significant amount of money um a large percentage of your of your funds are going into high you know some of these risky assets and you don't want to speculate too much out of the top you know top cup two or three maybe the top 10 then understanding these patterns are I think very important to navigate the cryptoverse in a successful way and so over the last two and a half years if you wanted exposure to crypto and you decided what do you want to buy do you want to buy Bitcoin or eth my view for the last two and a half years is that Bitcoin is the better play because it will likely hit new all-time highs first which it did it will likely not be subject to as much regulation risk as ethereum and also guess what during quantitative tightening e Bitcoin bleeds and it's as simple as that and you know I've seen all sorts of narratives out there that are saying that well proof of stake has failed or that you know there's all these other things there's no evidence of that yet actually there really isn't this is all just monetary policy stuff there's no evidence of any of that yet I think Bitcoin has stood the test of time well and I hope that ethereum does but everything that you've seen happen since November 202 1 is an artifact of monetary policy nothing more so it might lead people to believe that proof of stake is failing when in reality it's just an artifact of tighter monetary policy which is exactly what we saw last cycle in fact during quantitative tightening last cycle we saw the eth Bitcoin valuation bleed in fact if you were to Overlay Bitcoin USD onto this chart you will find that we had a bull market in 2019 and during that bull market Bitcoin did not put in a new high but eth Bitcoin went down because the Fed was still doing quantitative tightening what marked the bottom for eth Bitcoin what marked the bottom it was precisely when the fed pivoted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing that was the bottom it wasn't any more complicated than that it wasn't the narratives that you could have come up with back then it had nothing to do with what some YouTuber was saying about whether it was going to just go to zero or something all it had to do was was was the FED printing money or not was the FED reducing the size of the balance sheet or were they increasing the size of the balance sheet that's what it came down to and once again everyone's trying to over complicate it and come up with a thous different narratives for why it's happening and I said a long time ago that this was what's going to happen when it breaks down people will find a reason and of course the reason that people are looking at is regulation risk which is what we said a long time ago some of the reg regulation news that we've seen recently and also the potential rejection of the spot ETF for ethereum none of that stuff matters none of it matters ethereum has been fine without a spot ETF forever it's not going to die if it if it's rejected I think ethereum's valuation against the US dollar is going down but not because of the spot ETF eth went to $4,800 without a spot ETF I think eth USD is going to go down because eth Bitcoin has broken support it is broken below the June 2022 low and that is the important thing to consider you know if you if you don't follow it too closely we can look very closely at it here the low in June of 2022 for eth Bitcoin was 0.409 so if you draw a line across the page at 0409 so we're going to get a line here 040 well let me get it exact right here there you have it 0049 that was the low and what I said was that we will get a weekly close below the range low and when we do that is when ethereum finally starts to go down on its USD valuation and you can see eth Bitcoin is capitulating below the range low ethusd is starting to capitulate as well last cycle the first month that ethusd fell after e Bitcoin topped a 25% drop by the monthly close a 25% drop by the monthly close for eth this time would put it at around 2700 give or take a 100 or so you know because I didn't really get that accurate there about 27 let's just say 27 2800 something like that 26 2800 because it's not going to be exact anyways just because it was 25 here doesn't mean it has to be 25 here but then where it became brutal was while a lot of people assumed that it would be a buy the dip opportunity the following month after eth Bitcoin broke down it dropped another 21% right so imagine if ethusd first drops that 25% to get it down to 2700 and then drops another 21% from there where does that put e coincidentally it puts it at $2,000 right at 2K and what you'll notice is after it had this drop it then tried to hold that as support for a little while right and that support level that it tried to hold was also the the resistance level back over here it was the resistance level this resistance level was\n",

      "month after eth Bitcoin broke down it dropped another 21% right so imagine if ethusd first drops that 25% to get it down to 2700 and then drops another 21% from there where does that put e coincidentally it puts it at $2,000 right at 2K and what you'll notice is after it had this drop it then tried to hold that as support for a little while right and that support level that it tried to hold was also the the resistance level back over here it was the resistance level this resistance level was 2K right so my guess is that this summer and probably as maybe even as soon as May in fact May or June I think we will see there's a there's a high likelihood we will see eth at 2K if I'm wrong it's because Bitcoin is getting some type of left translated cycle and it's just dragging eth up with it right and in that case case while technically I would be wrong about about ethusd you would still be better off with Bitcoin than ethereum okay I wish I had known this stuff in Prior Cycles it's not like anyone told me I learned the hard way and I was hoping to help other people not go through that and that's why I've been talking about the Bitcoin dominance forever and all Bitcoin pairs forever so 2K is the level that I think eth is going to correct down to after the Bitcoin having from there it will probably try to hold it as support is my guess but I also think that it will fail to hold it as support and I do think it will eventually go to the lower logarithmic regression trend line if you look at a lot of these bottoming processes for ethereum what you'll notice notice is that it doesn't just tend to put in one low and then never revisit it right you can see over here it put in a low and then it got pretty close to testing it a while later if you just look at monthly closes you can see that these monthly closes we eventually Wicked below the monthly closes you can see over here these monthly closes we eventually went below them right so once again I think eth will eventually go back below these levels and and go back to the lower logarithmic regression trend line especially now that eth Bitcoin has fallen so just as everyone is getting hyped up for the Bitcoin having and and all the things that come with it what happens if this plays out and instead of getting a left translated Peak like everyone's talking about what happens if we just bleed after it for 6 months and we just see ethusd go back to the lower logarithmic aggression trend line we had a we had a 9month bare Market over here after eth Bitcoin broke down if you ignore the pandemic we had a six-month bare market after eth Bitcoin broke down why can't that happen again Bitcoin when Bitcoin sneezes the rest of the market gets extremely sick take a look at where Bitcoin is this cycle okay as measured Peak to Peak as measured Peak to Peak you can see how far ahead of schedule we are I mean we are so far ahead of schedule right now Bitcoin has never been this heat of going into the having it's always been the last two cycles Bitcoin was 60% below its high when we went into the having if Bitcoin falls back into line with the last couple of Cycles what happens to eth you know I mean you can see that eth Bitcoin is going down right so if Bitcoin USD goes back to where it was previously let's say Bitcoin goes back to where it was just say like I don't know half a year ago but instead of eth Bitcoin being up here it's all the way down here then ethusd gets hit a lot harder right that's the reason why the Bitcoin valuations are important if you take the inverse of one over if you take the inverse of e Bitcoin so you're looking at the Bitcoin eth valuation what do you notice over here one Bitcoin would have gotten you about 11 to 12 eth now it gets you 20 eth I think it's going to go out pretty high here and potentially get you know 32 E when it's all said and done now when you look at eth Bitcoin there's a case to be made that it's either on a logarithmic regression path or it's an oscillator okay so the logarithmic regression path would be viewed like this something like that meaning even if you're a long-term Bull on the eth Bitcoin valuation which I've said many many times like I can understand why you might be I mean these are technically higher lows but even if you are it's still likely is going to go down to the 03 to 04 range before you figure out if the higher lows are important or if the lower Highs are more important because everyone on X whenever I post anything about the eth Bitcoin valuation they will tell me well you're ignoring the higher low I'm not ignoring anything you know I've pointed them out a million times but the reality is that you have higher lows here but eth Bitcoin has also not seen a new high since 2017 that's a long time you know imagine if like Bitcoin hadn't seen a new all-time high since 2017 you know how people give uh the gold bugs a hard time because gold took like 10 years to put on a new all-time high I mean who are you talking to if you're an eth maxi you have no room to stand really here because it's been bleeding against Bitcoin since 2017 yes eusd has gone to new Highs but so what you still you know it still was lower highs against Bitcoin sure as measured from the bottom e outperforms Bitcoin in a QE bull market how many people have said over the last two and a half years that you know just you wait e outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market it outperforms Bitcoin in a QE bull market but in a qt bull market e Bitcoin gets annihilated in fact if you look at quarterly returns for eth Bitcoin the last if you include this quarter which is just started the last six quarters have been red you know that's not the definition of holding up well that's the definition of a slow and painful bleed where retail investors keep capitulating because they they're changing their mind about it and I think that eth Bitcoin has entered into the final capitulation phase so I don't know exactly how long it's going to take to find a bottom I can tell you that the last couple of times it took about two to three months okay so here you can see we broke down in like October it bottomed out about two months later here it broke down in Ju July it bottomed out about 2 months later about 8 weeks in fact so there is a case to be made that it could bottom in June right there's a case to be made that it could um again it's probably going to be dependent on when the FED pivots If the Fed doesn't pivot until later then it could take longer for it to bottom in fact while it did bottom in June it still or sorry over here while it bottomed in August and then basically put in a double bottom in December now a lot of people will say that I've seen on on X when I post about this they'll say oh so you're just telling me in two more months eth is you know they'll say that they'll their interpretation of me saying that eth Bitcoin might find a bottom this summer their interpretation of that is to then immediately assume that that means eth is going to Skyrocket following that the reality is that even after eth Bitcoin bottomed in August of 2019 eth us D even after eth Bitcoin bottomed ethusd still dropped 47% after that and if you ignore the pandemic it dropped about 30% okay that is going to be the next phase of the market cycle which I think is going to be a difficult phase because do you know how over the last two and a half years I've said that that eth Bitcoin will go down no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD the next phase of the cycle as we get into rate cuts is especially when the FED pivots from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing and E Bitcoin finally finds a bottom probably between 03 to 04 the next phase is me saying that eth Bitcoin goes up no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD the reason why that's going to be challenging is because a lot of people are going to assume that if eth Bitcoin is going up they're going to assume that ethusd is going up but in reality that's not what happened last cycle eth Bitcoin started to go up and put in higher lows and I mean this was a higher low here but ethusd was still going down that's why the last year has been frustrating because Bitcoin dominance has gone up and I said many times that e Bitcoin will bleed no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD and it has but ethusd has gone up so people feel like they missed out my only point was if you want crypto bitcoin's better play than eth so yes maybe you feel like you missed out on eth you still just would have been better off with Bitcoin so you didn't really miss out on anything in fact if you were to go look at a DCA strategy if you had bought Bitcoin $100 of it even since the beginning of 2022 through today you're currently up about 125% had you done the same thing for ethereum you're only up 68% right and if you actually take it from say November of 2022 right if we actually take it from the the the capitulation region or whatever you can see that with eth you'd be up about 69% but with Bitcoin you'd be up 120% so this is why I mean I've learned my lesson you know I've tried really hard to sort of preach the the the talk about Bitcoin dominance and all Bitcoin Pairs and and thinking that I could get to through to some people and I think I have reached some people but I can assure you the next cycle this will not be my goal okay it will not be my goal anymore because I've learned the hard way that people do not care about Bitcoin valuations for the most part they mostly focus on USD valuations and they don't see that eth Bitcoin has dropped 40% from the highs all they care about or 45% from the highs all they care about is the fact that it's gone up recently but I think people are about to find out why the Bitcoin valuation matters it's been fun in games up until this point but eth Bitcoin had not broken support it has broken support now the last two times this happened ethusd had a considerable drop and it lasted for at least a few months over here and then the last cycle it lasted for about half a year so please understand that this is not you know do you think I I mean look guys I really enjoyed talking about e Bitcoin back over here when I was bullish on it in 2019 I really enjoyed it and and everyone liked you know everyone liked me and then I became the bad guy in you know in in 2022 when I pointed out the fact that eth Bitcoin was in a distribution phase and it was very hard for me mentally because I had a lot of friends back then in the ethereum community that essentially turned their back on me and and started you know they they were once people that I communicated with in a good way and in a positive way and because I Chang my view they you know essentially completely changed their opinion about me and it's been very hard dealing with that um and and you know even this video over here I talked about the coming collapse you know talking about it coming back down here and and and continuing to to sort of break down um you know looking at at these various Trends and I you know Market the market is a difficult thing you know because if you're bullish on something and I mean this is maybe some advice for for any of you guys that search your own YouTube channel um it's hard because I I I feel like as as and this is maybe just some Reflections but think as a as a influencer for back lack of better word in the crypto space naturally you're going to be if you're making videos about something you're going to be bullish on it more for for a lot of people right if you're going to start a YouTube channel on an asset class it's not like you're going to start it just to say you know say bad things about it right when you start it you're naturally bullish on it right I started mine in mid 2019 I was bullish on eth bitcoin I saw the opportunity there but as an influencer you either stop making videos as the hero or you do it long enough to become the villain and it's not a fun place to be um it's really not and I I'm I'm happy that this process is is likely almost over but I still think it needs at least a couple more months okay June at the earliest is my guess that eth Bitcoin bottoms out June at the earliest about mid June could be when it finally bottoms out which would be interesting because that's when it bottomed out in 2022 in fact so if you look at it from that perspective what if it just bottoms eight weeks after breaking support just like it did here and just like it did here and if it bottoms eight weeks later after breaking support that puts the bottom in mid June basically maybe early June early let me get this exact because I don't I don't want to tell you guys something this wrong um from the low so we broke it last week so eight weeks later would be the week of June 3 right so I mean if it if it happened by the end of the week right it would be you know June 10th right June 9th June 10th so I could see a compelling case for it essentially bottoming out as early as June but it's also going to be dependent on monetary policy right if we get to June and the FED is still not cutting rates and and they're still not going from quantitative easing to quantitative or quantitative tightening to quantitative easing then it might go on longer and you know it's very possible we just go into a recession um but I I do think my base case at this point in time is that eth Bitcoin bottoms this summer ethusd bleeds a little bit longer and then at some point later this year or early next year the FED will will turn the money printer back on and then you will see a bull you know a a bull phase for the E Bitcoin valuation but I don't think we're there yet I don't and you know this is a long process you can't really rush it we can come up you know everyone's had a thousand different narratives for the last two and a half years as to why I was wrong on the eth Bitcoin valuation the deflationary aspect of it the tokenomics right all the merge proof of stake all these things they said I'm not considering the spot ETF right even after the spot ETF for Bitcoin was launched what happened eth Bitcoin got a pretty big pump and do you guys realize how many people dunked on me then where are they now right because it just keeps on bleeding and now I'm seeing the same thing now people are saying well after the having you know e Bitcoin will will show you what's up but I I don't think so I think it's going to keep on bleeding for the next couple of months maybe bottoming out by mid June at the earliest maybe early to mid June um potentially later depending on on what the FED does those are my views it's been hard expressing them for a while but to be completely honest I I don't apologize for them um this is the entire reason I I mean I I just wanted to help right I just wanted to help the Bitcoin dominant stuff I know it's made me a ton of enemies but I I was just trying to help and and now it's you know it's a it's it's broken out right it really has broken out and I think it's about to go to 60% that's where I think it's going 60% so it can't get to 60% easily if eth Bitcoin doesn't drop and I I do think that eth Bitcoin is going to drop to the 03 to 0.04 range and the reason why you should heed this warning if you don't hold ethereum is because the altcoin market gets wrecked even worse okay so if you look at altcoins from last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down the altcoin market got destroyed frankly um you know if you were to look at at total three and I know everyone's just saying this is a is a dip buying opportunity but I'm I'm over here thinking that this is this right this is when you know this was just before the FED pivoted what if this is the same thing and everyone's just buying the dip on alt as they just slowly bleed back down for the next several months so when eth Bitcoin collapsed last cycle all USD valuations fell 72% so I guess it was actually about the same um as as as eth us so about 72% so 72% drop would actually put alt at a new low can that happen maybe I often come back to this idea that everyone you know that no one's going to like but if their Bitcoin valuation can put in new lows right like if A's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if Dot's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if litecoin's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if maddox's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if all of these different altcoins can put in new lows on their Bitcoin valuations then they can put new lows on their USD valuations too I didn't want to believe it last cycle I really didn't and and that's what happened they put in new lows a lot of them put in new lows so I think that is is is something that is worthwhile to think about you know and I I know I I know these I I hate putting these videos out frankly because then I'm just inundated with with um you know with with people who who troll me back but I don't want to I don't want to say things that don't believe and I learned the lesson the hard way the last cycle and the reality of the situation right the reality the altcoin Reckoning was was always based on their Bitcoin valuations I said that in basically every altcoin Reckoning video the altcoin Reckoning re refers to the devaluation of alt Bitcoin pairs alt Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows what does that mean it means the altcoin Reckoning never ended that's what it means that's my interpretation of it so those are my thoughts about ethereum I've tried to you know to be diplomatic about the US Dev evaluation um in terms of hey it's going to go up if Bitcoin goes up but with eth Bitcoin breaking down I I do feel some very strong conviction that it is is time it is time for ethereum to make the Journey Back to the lower regression band admittedly it has taken a lot longer than I thought I'm not going to pretend like I predicted this perfectly because I haven't and I've been wrong about many many things but the last two cycles that e Bitcoin broke down that is when eth went to the lower logarithmic progression trend line and I just I don't think this time is going to be any different if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe crypt.of this either way um but as we you know as we do get further into the cycle um you know I know a lot of you guys are are wanting me to talk a lot more about altcoins especially as they bought them out against Bitcoin but frankly I don't know I mean I I do want to talk about at least the larger you know the the Bitcoin and ethereum I will talk about those but there's so much there's just so much garbage being shilled everywhere right now that that that people are being paid to do it and it's just it's such a you know such such a disheartening thing honestly like I will get people asking me to uh shill a a micro cap you know a meme coin and they'll offer you know money to do so and I will say no and I will ignore them and I I honestly just typically block them because I I don't really want to talk to those people and then a few days later I will see people on on X Shilling that coin and and I know and they pretend like they just think it's a good coin when in reality I know that they're being paid to do it and they're not disclosing it and then their followers are following them and then they're selling those those they they they were given these allocations in these projects and they're selling those coins to their followers as they promote them and those people get all the accolades because that's what people want they want the 100x gems they want to gamble right but that usually doesn't work right get rich quick schemes really don't work and um you really have to be careful and you know the issue that I found is that so many people in crypto they just they they they forget about it right they'll they'll fall for the scams and then and then they'll get mad at those people that Shield them and then six months later\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the having if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom the sale will be ending just after the having so make sure you check it out and lock in the lower rate let's go ahead and jump in the Bitcoin having is probably one of the most significant events in our industry I often find people debating every cycle you know whether the having is priced in or not whether it has an effect on pric or not my view is that you know we've had three having before we had one in 2012 one in 2016 and of course one in 2020 and I I certainly do think that the having does play a role in the cycles of the crypto verse um I also think that monetary policy plays a role but I don't really fall in either Camp completely I don't think that it's only based on supply side stuff and I don't think it is only based on you know monetary policy I think it's a combination of of different things markets are complex um they're they're based on a lot of different things and so because the having is one of the most important events I wanted to do a video where we talk about it and talk about where where I have previously said that theit the price of Bitcoin may be now price predictions are honestly something that I'm not super into um because usually you know usually price predictions don't really turn out that great if if you put in a price prediction and it goes above it then you know the comments aren't so nice and if you put a price prediction and we don't quite get there you know people are also upset but I wanted to to revisit something that I said four years ago and kind of see like where are we with respect to that so four years ago I put out this video Bitcoin Fair valuation at the next tabing in 2024 I put out this video in 2020 in May of 2020 the price of Bitcoin was around $8,000 and what I said back then was that if we follow the fair value logarithmic regression trend line then by the fourth having which is the having that's about to occur the price to bitcoin would be between 40 to $50,000 okay that's what I said back then clearly we are above that price right clearly if we go back and look at the video that I put out a year ago or no this was at the end of 2022 um or mid 2022 just before the the the um the final collapse occurred I also sort of Drew it out going to around a 40 to 50K so with Bitcoin right now at 63k it's ahead right I mean there's no denying it it's ahead of where I said it was going to be back then now of course back then putting out a price prediction four years later um and and hoping that it would be accurate at all was probably something I was fairly naive about uh but here we are 4 years later and the price of Bitcoin is actually above the target range that I put and it's also above this area that I put as well going into the having and so with that in mind I I want to discuss a couple of things that that may come up after the having um that could very well uh take some people by surprise now there's a lot of different thoughts to this current cycle with it being you know so hot at this point in the cycle we've never seen the market put in new highs before the having right this is the first time ever that Bitcoin has put in new highs before the having and so that was you know probably one of the reasons why back then I I didn't think it would be quite so high but we are at new highs before the having and so I just want to talk about what you know what to potentially expect after the happing now there's two different trends of thought here one of which is a left translated Peak okay now to be completely honest I'm not really in the left translated Peak camp but it does have like maybe 40% of my attention and the reason for that is if you were to take the ROI of Bitcoin from Peak to Peak and you take it from the April Peak Peak instead of the November 2021 Peak and you compare it to last cycle it sort of looks like it potentially could form into a peak sooner rather than later in which case you would get a left translated top meaning the the the actual top occurs way before anyone thinks it will historically Bitcoin has topped out in the fourth quarter of the post having year so if you look at Major Peaks that Bitcoin has had in the past if I were to get an arrow here you can see that this top was in Q4 of the post having year this one was in Q4 of the post having year and this one was in Q4 of the posst having Year we're currently in Q2 of the having year so you know that is is still about six quarters away when Bitcoin typically tops but again so far this cycle is anything but typical with Bitcoin putting in new before the having so if it is to translate into a left translated Peak a left translated cycle then it would be more likely that the top would occur in 2024 as opposed to 2025 if we are going to follow that then I have to imagine that we would follow potentially what happened last cycle now it's not really my base cas but again it would be foolish not to at least acknowledge the similarities but on the other hand where I would say 60% of my attention is right now is what if this cycle is just like prior cycles and we are all over here jumping through hoops trying to explain why this time is different when potentially it just Peaks when it normally does and one way that we could go about getting to that point would be that if we had a cool off in the summer okay now there's no guarantee and if we follow this path then you might see the exact opposite of a summer lull but if there is a summer lull then one thing to keep in mind when you look at the last two cycles as measured Peak to Peak you can see that at this point in the cycle Bitcoin was only up or it was it was actually still about 60% down from its all-time high now I want you to think about that for a minute in both prior Cycles at this point as measured Peak to Peak Bitcoin was 60% below the all-time high 60% below it now right now Bitcoin is not 60% below the prior high in fact 60% below the prior High would put Bitcoin all the way down at around $26,000 that's how accelerated we are this cycle look at the last cycle 60% down from that Peak you can see that by May of 2020 that was when the having occurred Bitcoin was down 60% from the high and then if you go back to the cycle before that this the that the having occurred in July if I remember correctly and if you go to July of 2016 you will see that Bitcoin was approximately down 60% from the high this having it's not right it's not 60% down from the high in fact it is at the high it's at the high which has never happened before so this has caused a lot of people to view this cycle as different from the prior ones and I have to tell you they make a fair point they make make a fair point and if you measure it from the April top you can kind of see that Bitcoin is doing just about what it always does at this point in the cycle if you take the April top as the more important top and of course there is evidence to suggest that the April top is the more important top for instance some of that evidence to suggest the April top is the more important top is to look at views to a lot of different cryptocurrency YouTube channels and to note that there were more views in the first half of 2021 than there were in the second half where Bitcoin basically just put in a lower high in terms of social activity but somehow a higher high in terms of price if you look at Bitcoin with respect to its 50e moving average one of the things that it does after every major cycle top is that it goes back down to the 50 we and then gets a bounce a dead cap bounce before ultimately capitulating we saw that happen over here as well go back to the 50 we get a dead bounce and then go all the way down this past cycle we did not see that exactly what happened was we went back to the 50 we and instead of it just being a dead cap bounce to a lower high which is what potentially that would have been we ended up getting a higher high which took a lot of people off guard now I was optimistic of a higher high but honestly I think because of for for wrong reasons you know and sometimes you get things right for the wrongs reasons and and it's important to take that into consideration so we can see that that happened right we can see that we went to the 50 we we got a bounce but that time it actually led to a higher high the even the intermediate bull market in 2019 had us bouncing off the 50 week at some point and so the 50 we today is at around 40K it's at 39.2k 39.3k which is interesting because again that is way below the current prices way below current prices and I have to imagine that if we do not evolve into a left translated top if we do not right so there's two op you know there's two options right we evolve into a left translated top where the peak occurs in 2024 or we evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 if we're going to evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 you really need to see Bitcoin cool off for a while and again as measured Peak to Peak you can see just how far quote unquote ahead of schedule this cycle is it's actually not that unfamiliar when you think about it the reason it seems like this time is different is because Bitcoin is at new all-time Highs but if you look at the last cycle there was a period where it too was well above its prior cycle but what eventually happened is it bled back down and basically got in line with the prior cycle and then still ended up showing diminishing returns okay and then it actually got ahead of that cycle again this is why a lot of people thought we were going to go to 300 K last cycle but it still was diminishing returns so I want to continue to put forth this idea that if we do not evolve into a left translated Peak sometime around the having and instead the market cools off going into the summer then you might just see something like this where it causes the cycle to just get back in line with prior Cycles now that of course could make a lot of people think that the cycle that the peak is over and and the Bull Run is is is completely done and and maybe they're right right but there is at least some evidence to suggest that that could be what is ultimately in store for us as we get lat into the cycle if you're not familiar with how the last cycle worked and why we what what happened when we bled back down here there's a number of things that really put Bitcoin back into a intermediate bare Market sort of you had a a quantitative tightening bull market and then a bare Market as rate Cuts arrived and then a QE bull market that topped in 2025 now take a a look at Bitcoin this cycle and see how it's doing something very very similar in the sense that it's had this major run during High interest rates you can see it's had this run during High interest rates and in fact if you were to look very closely at when the FED paused here and compare it to this you can see something very similar happened right it it fell just after the FED paused here it fell just after the FED paused and then it went up quite a lot but ultimately what happened is that it it found a local top as just before rate Cuts arrived and then it bled for a while before getting another bull run into the post having year now by the way the having is only four four days away so if we do come up and put in a new local high before the having or maybe around the having that still doesn't necessarily invalidate the idea of the market cooling off sometime after the having if the left translated Peak is not going to occur okay so again there's two thoughts you have a left translated Peak where us Deens just can't help ourselves and everyone just front run runs everything until until the consumer caves or the other idea which would support the idea of this time not being different would just for the cycle to get back in line now if the cycle gets back in line then maybe this view from four years ago of around a you know 40 to 50K Bitcoin by the fourth having isn't that far off I know right now if we were to go back to 40 to 50 okay it would probably feel like the world's falling apart for a lot of people but one thing to consider is that when when e I'm you know I don't know how I made it this far in the video without talking about it one thing to consider last cycle is that the 30% drop Bitcoin had pretty shallow drops during this QT bull market right pretty shallow drops and then eventually it finally got a 30% drop that 30% drop corresponded precisely to the point when eth Bitcoin broke down and eth Bitcoin just broke down below the summer 2022 low so if you were to get a 30% drop sometime after the having that would actually put you kind of right around that range that we said way back over here and in addition to that it would also get you Loosely backed in line with where the prior Cycles were so going into this Bitcoin having is certainly different in the sense that we've never seen a new all-time high before the habing if you were to go look at the risk metric of Bitcoin you will see that the risk on bitcoin has never been this High going into the having in fact the last time we went into the the the 20 when we went into the 2020 having the risk of Bitcoin was at 04 when you look at the 2016 having in July of 2016 the risk on bitcoin was 0.4 today the Bitcoin risk is6 so it's actually quite a bit higher than it was during the last two 3 to4 this time we find ourselves at 639 and only a few weeks ago the risk was in the 7 to8 risk band to give you an idea of what the 04 risk band would look like which is where we were going into the last two that's where the 04 to 0.5 wristband is that's where the price of Bitcoin was at the last two Habs and you can see actually that Bitcoin when those rate Cuts arrived right here had that correction back to the 100 we moving average now what's fascinating about that is that it would correspond to the prior breakout zone so I I I feel like there's two different ways that we can look at the market here here that make the most amount of sense number one is that this is not different from the prior cycles and we're kind of on track with where we should be and that could be viewed by maybe looking at the ROI after the after the low if you look at the ROI after the low and you compare this cycle with two cycles ago this is exactly where we were but you can see that it at this point it did cool off for a while and then did get a drop kind of um you know this was day 520 or so about you know a month and a half from now or so so you can view it like that or you can view it from the peak and still say we're where we should be based on uh based on measuring it from the April top right if you take this out Peak to Peak if you measure it from the April top we're pretty much where we should be but again I can't help but think are we are we are we doing the same thing again where everyone tries to come up with a reason for why this time is different but in reality it's not so my thought process on the matter is this as we go into the Bitcoin having if Bitcoin accelerates into the having and post having and into June right if it is something like that where you know over here in 2019 in fact before rate Cuts arrived it actually did rally in until June last year we had a a local top in April but then we swept the high in June if we get something like that where Bitcoin continues to go up throughout the summer then I would be more in tune with the idea of a left translated top where you get a top in 2024 as opposed to say 2025 however on the other hand if you get a low Top by Bitcoin here as rate Cuts arrive and then instead of you know and that could still include sweeping the prior high right but if you get a look kind of like we did over here with the spot ETF we we put in a new high on the day of the spot ETF for the cycle if on the other hand we see the market cool off into the summer and go to say the 04 to 0.5 wristband or even the 0. 3 to point4 wristband and we get the market more back in line with the prior two cycles then I I think that perhaps the base case should still be that the cycle is playing out just as it always has and you still could get a top in in late 2025 and in fact it was this very intermediate bare Market that kind of scared a lot of people off in fact what happens if something like that happens again where rate Cuts arrive and you go back down scares a lot of people off and then because everyone gets scared off the FED starts printing money again and then you get a QE bow Market I've said this before and I'll say it again there's two types of bull markets in crypto there's quantitative tightening bull markets that occur during periods when the FED is lowering reducing the assets on their balance sheet that's what we got in 2019 and that's what we've got over here and during those periods during those periods eth Bitcoin goes down eth Bitcoin goes down during QT quantitative tightening bull markets how many people for the last couple of years have said that eth outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market that's not true not without any disclaimer because as you can see bitcoin's been going up since late November of 2022 and eth Bitcoin has been going down the entire time so that is why I still think there is some evidence to suggest the cycle may play out like it always does rather than a left translated top I'm not completely unsympathetic to the idea of a left translated Peak there's a lot of really smart people out there that frankly provide a compelling case for it and I could honestly provide a compelling case for it I just showed you guys some of the different charts but if Bitcoin does not run into the highest wristbands the 0. N to one wristband this summer and instead it just cools off like it did back over here after the having it might scare a lot of people off but perhaps it's just doing what it did last cycle and it the only reason that the top the local the midcycle top came later was because rate Cuts came later this cycle than they did last cycle so you have quantitative tightening bull markets where Bitcoin goes up as e Bitcoin bleeds all Bitcoin pairs bleed and then you have QE bull markets that go where Bitcoin goes up as eth Bitcoin goes up so eth outperforms Bitcoin in a QE Market but not a QT Market there's two different different types of bull markets so that is a very important distinction and I think we've only received more and more evidenced over the last year that Bitcoin really is dependent somewhat on monetary policy because last September when eth Bitcoin came back down to to this area right here there were there were a lot of people that thought that it had bottomed because that's when it had bottomed in the last cycle Q3 of the pre having year this development here which is what I said was likely going to happen this development of the the devaluation of eth against Bitcoin shows that the market is very much dependent on monetary policy whether we want to believe it or not so if that is the case right if that continues to be the case then you very well could see a a repeat of what happened over here sort of an intermediate Lull in the market followed by because of rate Cuts right that occur during rate Cuts followed by the last rate cut which leads to a QE bull market where you maybe top out when you normally do in the latter part of the post tapping year so two different theories if you're new here that's what is you know has really been discussed over the last uh year or so is this cycle different is it not I honestly think if you if you have a bias on it you're going to find the evidence that you're looking for um I I think we we'll know soon\n",

      "The speaker presents two potential scenarios for the market's behavior after the halving. The first is a \"left-translated peak\" where the market tops out earlier than historical cycles, potentially in 2024 rather than 2025. The reasoning is that Bitcoin has already reached new all-time highs before the halving, which is unprecedented. The second scenario is a more typical cycle where the market cools off after the halving, potentially dropping to the $40-50,000 range the speaker previously forecasted, before resuming its bull run later in the post-halving year.\n",

      "of rate Cuts right that occur during rate Cuts followed by the last rate cut which leads to a QE bull market where you maybe top out when you normally do in the latter part of the post tapping year so two different theories if you're new here that's what is you know has really been discussed over the last uh year or so is this cycle different is it not I honestly think if you if you have a bias on it you're going to find the evidence that you're looking for um I I think we we'll know soon enough we we'll know soon enough if Bitcoin cools off into the summer which it very well could we we've seen gold breakout just like it did in mid 2019 we've seen eth Bitcoin break down just like it did in mid 20 M mid 2019 all Bitcoin pairs still haven't broken down yet but if it cools off into the summer then it just seems like it's the same thing as last cycle it's just that the the midcycle top was nine months later about about n nine months later if on the other hand after the having Bitcoin just accelerates to the upside once again then I will have to uh I will probably say that there's more Merit to the idea of of a left translated top but that's what I'm looking at right now and so to just revisit my prediction back in 2020 what would be the fair value of Bitcoin at the fourth having of 40 to 50k I find myself today seeing a $64,000 Bitcoin 4 days before the having and I I can't think I can't help but think to myself wow back then when I made that prediction I thought it was a lofty prediction that frankly was maybe not you know not that likely to come true because you know when Bitcoin is at 8K and and it really hadn't done anything for a couple of years I wasn't really that optimistic um of of you know exactly how accurate this prediction would be come to find out I was too conservative potentially right I was too conservative so it just goes to show how difficult these markets are to predict um four years ago price of Bitcoin was at 8K I said fourth having 40 to 50 instead we find ourselves at 64 and what's fascinating to me is that if we were at 40 to 50K I think it would you know a lot of people would think the the world's falling apart when in reality that would have been what the fair value sort of suggested it would be and that chart that chart that you see in that video is just this chart right here um these regression bands here so at the last taing we were at the fair value that's the other thing that why I said 40 to 50K back then because at every prior having Bitcoin was at the fair value so in no the fit to non-bubble data so in November 2012 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to non-bubble data in July of 2016 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to quote unquote non-bubble data in May of 2020 Bitcoin was at its fair value fit to again quote unquote non bubble data theoretically I should have updated this chart because it does I think need to get updated every cycle I haven't really done it yet if I did update it it would just shift it down very very slightly but right now according to this chart the fair value is around um 52k 52k but if you if you were to refit it based on this data over here it would actually probably put the fair value somewhere between 40 to 50K which is why I said back over here like we'll have to refit it um and and it'll be around 40 to 50K so we're above that level right now if on the other side of the having or something we see that level just know that that is is is what the um you know the regression band would have ultimately suggested for this part of the cycle so those are my thoughts going into the Bitcoin having we will see what happens uh as the having comes around it's only four days away and and we will do an update in maybe a month or so we'll see what happened you know after the having if we just contined to rally on into a left translated top or if it cools off like 2019 and and we just kind of come back down and and cool off until until the last rate cut arrives if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe crypto.com links in the description below remember that sale is going to end after the having so lock in the low right now you will get access to thousands of different charts not just the ones I showed in this video but thousands of different charts we have onchain charts social media charts risk metric charts not only for Bitcoin but also for hundreds of different cryptocurrencies and macro charts and and charts for equities as well so make sure you guys check that out lock in the lower rate links in the description below inth Crypt ver.com thank you guys for tuning in subscribe give the video a thumbs up and I'll see you next time bye\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin dubious speculation if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse docomo remember the price of ITC premium will be going up after the having so you can lock in lower rate now let's go and jump in now you may be wondering why I am not making the video titled Bitcoin dominance after all we just saw dominance finally break to 56% and this has been a level that we've been talking about for a long time but there's two reasons why first of all my wife put out a Bitcoin dominance video uh a couple of weeks ago or so on April 1st and frankly I don't think there's anything else to add to that it's about 30 seconds long and I think it sums up what I would tell you over two hours sums it up well in about 30 seconds second of all all my video all my videos are Bitcoin dominance videos I just changed the title of the video to make people think that it's about something else but in reality it's all about the same thing so with that said let's just go in Bitcoin dubious speculation we're to pretend like we're going to talk about something else but in reality it will just go back to the same tired topic of dominance but as I've said Bitcoin dominance is the key to unlocking the secrets of the cryptoverse if you care to understand the larger Trends going on in it right now before we go over to the Bitcoin dominance Mantra and all that stuff let's just take a look at Bitcoin USD right we're going to assume at first that we know nothing about the rest of the cryptoverse in terms of all Bitcoin pairs um we're just going to look at Bitcoin USD by itself right in a vacuum without any other knowledge okay so what we're going to do is we're going to say all right we had a major event by Bitcoin in January and it was the spot ETF right was the spot ETF and what you'll notice is that Bitcoin actually rallied about a week before the actual spot ETF before this one and it swept the high right here right so you can see pretty clearly Bitcoin swept the high right now after sweeping the high it actually went back down to near the range lows right so if you look at the range lows you will see there was a an an initial Wick down but then the second Wick that came ended up being basically where that this Wick came after it swept the high right so you'll see a top a slightly lower high and then we swept the highs before getting a wick all the way back down to the bottom of the range right it's pretty clear you can see that now we've compared this move to the current move to see are there any deviations in it or is it playing out the same way now for a little bit it was playing out the same way you'll see that we had a high and then a lower high right if we just sort of remove all this other stuff for a minute just take a look at it like this right we had a high and then a lower high and this down here right this is our this is basically our range low right where you have a know you have this initial Wick kind of like this one and then you come back down to put in this Wick which this one tested right here looks pretty similar right but there is a difference right there is a subtle difference and what is that difference it's that the third move did not actually sweep the high like this one did right this one over here swept the high about a week before the Spy DTF and then after it swept the high it went back down to the range low now we just went back down to the range low right it looks pretty similar but there is a slight difference in that here we swept the high here we did not now this High here was actually slightly higher than this one like this one was to this one but it didn't take out this High over here so there is a very slight difference between the two moves and one of the explanations for that difference could be due to the fact that we've talked about sources of liquidity in the cryptoverse right you have three main sources that we talked about you have the regular DCA that just DCA is no matter what right they don't care what anyone has to say and frankly they win over the Long Haul anyway so who cares you have the regular DCA who doesn't care about anything that anyone has to say more power to them by the way that's not that's not a a jab at those people these these these people do really well over the long run you have those people you have the spot ETF flows and then you also and the spot ETF flows to me are different than the regular DCA the regular DCA who's been here forever is probably not buying spot ETFs they're probably just buying Bitcoin cuz they don't want to to pay a fee to some third party to hold their Bitcoin for them not your keys not your Bitcoin right or at least that's what you should have learned last cycle third source of liquidity where is it from the altcoin market right that's where that third source of liquidity is from and what you'll notice is that altcoins are starting to show some weakness right some of them are showing a lot of weakness right if you look at a lot of these alts they've broken down eth Bitcoin looks like it's breaking down still not a weekly close though right still not a weekly close could we get one tomorrow it's definitely possible but we've been in this position before and then it ended up being just a wick now whether it's a wick or not I do still think e Bitcoin will eventually close below the range low whether it's this week or next week I don't know but this source of liquidity for Bitcoin is dra drying up look at adaa Bitcoin it broke below the range lows dot Bitcoin broke below the range lows madic Bitcoin broke below the range lows right a lot of the altcoins are breaking below their range lows and so one source of liquidity for Bitcoin is slowly disappearing it's not that there's people not deing it it's not that there's not people that are going to keep putting money into the into the spot ETFs it's just that there's one s source of liquidity that has been there for the entire bull run all the way from you know 15K that now is not necessarily there anymore and so maybe that's why there is a slight deviation in it because again if you look at Bitcoin USC in a vacuum you can see that there's a difference between this one and this one and then you're like well why is there a difference well in January eth Bitcoin in January eth Bitcoin was above 049 today it's not and so perhaps that's the difference right liquidity is is important for Bitcoin and if it loses One Source it's not like it's completely gone it's just not as powerful and if you don't necessarily understand that think about it like this the purchasing power has gone down right so like as people convert their eth to bitcoin they can get less and less for their eth so because there's less purchasing power to buy that Bitcoin because the valuation of the asset that's being traded in for Bitcoin has gone down there's a sort you know there there's some liquidity that has dried up okay so there has been a deviation from this one over here to this one right now what happened next was that Bitcoin after going back down to the range low it visited it it went back up to the top and it it rallied into the launch of of the spot ETF R rallied into the launch of the spot ETF now will we rally into the Havoc I don't know honestly I don't know I've said before I I think the way to navigate crypto uh during quantitative tightening and high interest rates is just to be Bitcoin heavy as opposed to altcoin heavy because guess what Bitcoin dominance goes up no matter what and this is a great example of that happening right today or yesterday we saw Bitcoin drop um you know about 5% and guess what Bitcoin dominance went up and so had you held Bitcoin you're still at at at 64k Bitcoin you know it's still basically at the 2021 highs had you held alt coins you're nowhere close right you're nowhere close I mean a lot of these alts are so far down right like Ada is at 44 cents I mean it's it's it's closer to the lows than it is the highs right mtic is closer to the lows than it is the highs a lot of these dot closer to the lows than it is the highs right so that's why I say you know Bitcoin heavy is the way to go because even if Bitcoin gets a correction it's likely not going to go down as much as alt Bitcoin gives you the potential for the upside but it also minimizes your downside risk it doesn't mean there's no downside risk today shows you there's downside risk right but it minimizes it now Bitcoin can still go down down I'm not saying that it can't and and to be completely honest if all Bitcoin pairs break down I would expect it to get a deeper correction but they hav it broken down just yet what do I mean by that didn't Ben just say that all these alts had broken down well yes it's true that eth Bitcoin has broken down right it's true and it's true that ADA Bitcoin has broken down and the dot Bitcoin and that madic Bitcoin is broken down but there are still some alts that haven't broken down yet there are look at avac Bitcoin right I mean it is it's not it's still well off these lows over here that it set back in October of 20123 look at salana Bitcoin right it's way back up here look at B&B Bitcoin it's still nowhere near near these lows so it is true that some alts have already broken down but there are other alts that haven't broken down and when you look at them collectively they're sitting on support right look at a weekly look at a weekly candle for all Bitcoin pairs they're sitting on support support is at 0 4 We're at0 4 why is that important the reason it's important is because it was the weekly candle last cycle that closed below support that marked the the local top for Bitcoin USD it was precisely the week of June 24th where Bitcoin USD topped out and that was when all Bitcoin pairs broke down okay now here's where it gets tricky I can't know if tomorrow all Bitcoin pairs are going to close at 39 or below I don't know if they close at 04 then perhaps Bitcoin can get another move move into the Havoc if all Bitcoin pairs break down this week then there might not be enough liquidity to really send Bitcoin that much higher into the having so it's really hard to say it's again it's like an if then statement right if all Bitcoin pairs stay above 04 then Bitcoin can get another move if they break down then you're likely looking at that's it last cycle it actually took exactly 41 weeks after the range low was set for all Bitcoin payers to break down we are in week 41 but that doesn't mean they have to break down this week they certainly could right I mean I frankly that would be easier you know than having to Kick the Can down the road one more week but my point is this is that whatever happens next week I'm guessing is sufficient to break all Bitcoin pairs down whatever happens next week I don't know what that's going to look like necessarily okay again if you go look at at Bitcoin USD and we we know we compare it to what happened going into the spot etcf you can see that we actually visited the range low about one week before the spot ETF launched the having's one week away and we just visited the range low here so there is a chance right there is a chance that Bitcoin can get another popup into the having but I I I I really do think it depends on on what all Bitcoin pairs do now if there is a move into the having does it lead to a new high or not I don't know but if you look at this if you look at this trend line what you'll notice is that Bitcoin stayed Above This diagonal trend line line until after the spot ETF with the exception of some Wicks okay you see this trend line with the exception of some Wicks it stayed above the trend line until after the major event occurred let's look at what's going on here now it's going to depend on how you draw the trend line if you draw it like this it's already looking kind of iffy you know it's already looking kind of iffy and you might argue that we already closed below it but I imagine that you could kind of draw it like that and if Bitcoin got back Above This level today then everyone's just going to say well it was just a wick just like it was over here you know so watch carefully I I mean really I think what happens on Monday is is going to basically tell us what's going to happen going into the hab because a lot of Mondays recently we've seen Bitcoin pop up as those flows go into the spot ETFs let's see what happens to the spot ETFs on Monday right I mean do did the flows continue despite the pullback or does something else happen I don't know but look for this right look for something like this to happen if you wanted to be a little bit more you know conservative by this trend line and you just sort of connect it from this Wick to the Daily candle closes or something like that to this daily candle close you can see that we fell well below it so maybe you still get a move up into the having but what happens if it just ends up being a a low lower high right where it just kind of comes back up here maybe it even goes up even higher right but it ends up just being a lower high and then after the having you then actually sweep the low right so we sweep we swept the low over here but it didn't occur until after the spot ETF so perhaps we do eventually sweep the low and go below 60k but you know maybe it doesn't happen until after the Havoc I don't know we actually got already we already got pretty close right we went to to 61k it's not like it's impossible for Bitcoin to just Wick to 59k tomorrow but that just is showing you what happened during the last major event right we we kept going up and then after the event in question we then finally fell down and then swept the low now here's where things get tricky okay and this has been something that I you know we've been talking about forever every pullback that Bitcoin has had every single one has been 20 to 22% for the entire Bull Run 20 to 22% right the major pullbacks okay and so far from this high up there to where we currently are it's about 175% now at some point I'm going to guess that we're going to see that 20 to 22% pullback now if it's from this high right here then that would put you at around you know 57 to 59k depending on if it's like 20% or 22% if Bitcoin puts in a slightly higher high on the day of the having just like it did on the day of the Spy ETF and let's say it goes up a little bit higher then it still I mean it still puts you at around that 58 59k level so then if we do test that level in the coming couple of weeks or so whether it happens before the having or after the having whatever and whether we put in a new high or not whatever right these are all kind of details I mean you know this this channel while a lot of people think it's for short-term trading it's not I mean I I I literally just DCA when the risk levels are low and I DCA out when the risk levels are high and then everything else is just dubious speculation for fun that some of you guys take to the bank and try to cash it in and often you get surprised when the when when they don't accept it I don't know what's going to happen in the short term but what I will say is this is that in 2019 we had a very similar thing where every single pullback was shallow and it it left no room for anyone to get in okay left no room but then at some point we had a deeper correction where Bitcoin dropped from the high from the high here it dropped about the it dropped down here before it got a move back up it dropped 30% so previously we had only seen these shallow Corrections and then finally we got a 30% drop it's like what's going on right a 30% drop and it was the first time we had seen a 30% drop in a long time in fact if you were to go look at the fear and greed index on that day when we got that 30% drop back in 2019 you can see that the and greed index was I mean it had a huge drop here right all the way down to 62 right now we're still at 72 right but a major drop in a really short period of time so the 30% drop happened what was different why did it drop why did it drop 30% here and not over here here or any of these other Corrections right why was it that drop that it got a larger drop why that one in particular altcoins right was is because altcoins all Bitcoin pairs had broken down that's why a lot of people are are you know this this correction feels worse than this one over here because look at this you know Bitcoin is still way up here it's still way above where it was over here but a lot of altcoins are not I mean Ada is below everything this year right madic is below everything this year DOD is below everything this year for the most part Avalanche I mean it's it's all the way back down here so that's one of the reasons why I think it feels worse for people is because all these alt coins are getting rinsed and why is that it's because all Bitcoin pairs are breaking down potentially as Bitcoin dominance is finally breaking above the Range High we said before that this is a potential risk off signal now you have to be careful with that sort of stuff because when you look back at this stuff in three years it could very well have been a risk-off signal but on a one to two week time frame who knows if we Wick to a new high or not first right I don't know it's not like it's not like if we did it would invalidate everything else right it's possible that something like that would happen but you have to be careful right I you have to be careful I mean last cycle gold broke out the same time that Bitcoin dominance broke out this time gold broke out well in advance so it's not like it has to play out the exact week but it's it's close it's close so the reason that last cycle Bitcoin finally got a 30% drop right a 30% drop was because all Bitcoin pairs broke down and if you overlay all Bitcoin pairs right here and you put Bitcoin USD onto this chart you can see very very clearly that Bitcoin topped when all Bitcoin pairs broke down because that source of liquidity that Bitcoin was relying on for some of it move higher was gone it's not like there weren't people still dcing Bitcoin I mean Bitcoin just I mean it kept putting in lower highs for a while there there were still DCA right there were still some there was still liquidity there but the liquidity from the altcoin market was gone and so Bitcoin found a local top and then it bled for the next nine months okay so what would that look like right what would that look like if if Bitcoin did something like that today you know and again we we'll look at two scenarios one scenario where the local top is the top or one scenario where there's a slightly higher high going into the having so if this is the top and it's a 30% drop it puts you at 51 and a2k 51 and a2k huh why is that number interesting I'm glad you asked the bull market support band believe it or not right is right below or right right above that level right the bullmark sport B ranges from 52k to 54k right so a 30% drop from that level right actually if I get it to the wick here 30% drop puts you at around 51k right around the bullmark sport band now if there's a slightly higher high going into the having let's say you get a slightly higher high kind of like we we Wicked above it over here going into the spot ETF if you get a slightly higher high going into the having um let's say you know 75k or something then a 30% drop gets you you know to to 52 or 53k but the bullmark work B we be higher by that point too but you can kind of see like it could theoretically make sense and my point here is that I can't know if it's if we put in a higher high going into the spot or the the the having or not I can at least point out the similarities between this move here and this one but I also feel like I have to point out the differences\n",

The speaker analyzes the similarities and differences between the current price action and the period leading up to the launch of the Bitcoin spot ETF in January.

      "higher high going into the having um let's say you know 75k or something then a 30% drop gets you you know to to 52 or 53k but the bullmark work B we be higher by that point too but you can kind of see like it could theoretically make sense and my point here is that I can't know if it's if we put in a higher high going into the spot or the the the having or not I can at least point out the similarities between this move here and this one but I also feel like I have to point out the differences right and and this is this swept the high this didn't this diagonal trend line seems to have held this one potentially has but it's a little iffy you know I mean you kind of have to be very generous to say that it's held um so it's really hard to say right and you know you could get a situation where you rally back up to 70k and everyone thinks it's going to go to 7 25 or 80k and then it just tops out at a lower high going into the merge actually eth topped out about a month before the merge um you know if you you guys remember that right so the merge was here in September and ethusd topped out about a month before right so there are some examples where instead of actually putting in the high on the event in question you put it in a month in advance and then on the actual event you put in a lower high because every you know a lot of people are expecting it to be a higher high because though it's the main event but ends up being a lower high so you kind have to be careful right it doesn't have to play out in any specific way but I think that's what you have to look for here right you have to look at at all Bitcoin pairs right now they're at 04 again they haven't technically broken down yet as much as it seems like they should have considering the you know how bad alts have performed recently they still technically haven't broken down you want to see something else that's really interesting last cycle after this final roll here the first week was -45% look at this week here uh last week it was 4% then the following week was about -10% this week so far is3 and then the following week was -12% right so so my thinking here is whether Bitcoin puts in a higher high or a lower high during the week of the having I think all Bitcoin pairs could very well break down okay that's my that's what I think I think that they're going to break down and the reason for that is because eth is the index for the altcoin market and it sure as hell looks like it's breaking down and I think eth is is going to break down durably because I've suspected that madic Bitcoin is leading eth Bitcoin madic is higher risk than eth and it's broken down a long time ago and I think it's going to it's showing eth the way just like Ada Bitcoin has already broken down okay so you can go look at at Bitcoin USD and we can compare we can make all these comparisons to what happened back over here in the spot ETF and note some similarities and see some differences so I'm open-minded I'm I'm very open-minded for the week of they having um we've seen crazier things I don't know if it can go put in another high or not before you know before it it gets a larger correction but I will say that if you see a Bitcoin pairs durably going below 04 which very well could happen next week maybe even this week right I don't know we'll have to see if we go below 04 by the weekly close but if you see I let's look to see how close we are so 04 is here we'd have to go from where we currently are all Bitcoin pairs would need to bleed about 1 and a half% to get back to 39 will that happen by the weekly close I don't know if it doesn't happen by the weekly close then the implication is that maybe there's still some liquidity that can go back to bitcoin and give Bitcoin a little bit more fuel going into the having if all Bitcoin pairs break down before then then it could resolve like ethusd did going into the merge where it's just a lower high and if you look at at Bitcoin USD um the high that it put in at least at this point was March you know mid-march and you know about a month before you know before the the having April does tend to be a point where where Bitcoin can often kind of at least put in a local top for a while it doesn't have to be like a major top but I mean even last year we we found a local top in April and it actually topped out you know basically like April 14th um in 2021 it actually topped out I believe April 14th I don't know what it is about April 14th but uh you got 2021 and 2023 where Bitcoin USD topped out on April 14th um so that's kind of interesting and then you go back to 2013 and once again you find an example where Bitcoin finds a local top in April on April 10th right so you have all these examples where where Bitcoin finds a local top in April so because of that I'm open-minded especially as long as all Bitcoin pairs have not broken down once they break down I I I think that could be you know that we could be just going in for sort of a a summer lull if you will right um so do be careful uh with something like that I mean something like that could certainly happen and the crazy thing right I mean you know if you're new to the cryptoverse this is just one of those sort of those lessons right look at Bitcoin I mean legitimately it is basically still at the 2021 highs eeve hasn't even made it there right a lot of these coins haven't made it there I mean even salana has had a pretty good move but it still hasn't made it to the highs you know and a lot of these coins are not even close to the highs and are actually again they're closer to the lows than they are to the highs you want to hear some crazy statistics all Bitcoin pairs went lower yesterday than they have since April of 2020 or really like March on March of 2021 that's how long it's been since all Bitcoin pairs were that low the last time you know others a lot of people talk about others which is everything outside of the top 10 others Bitcoin which has been used relentlessly to mock the views on bitcoin dominance because it's been it's gone up a lot it just in this Wick here it wiped out every all the gains that it had since July of 20123 right and you want to see something crazy about others Bitcoin is that last cycle we saw it drop 60% rally 60% and then drop 60% as rate Cuts arrived same thing here right drop 60 rally 60 and then potentially drop 60 as rate Cuts arrived it's already dropped 30 right so I mean I had some people saying well it's not going to drop the same way it's already dropped 30 it's already dropped half right I mean 60% would put it at at at 0.1 it's currently at 02 so it's already dropped half of what we said it was likely going to drop and it did it in a week basically in one week it Dro it's dropped 177% this week right and then I mean it dropped a little bit obviously before that about 10% but a lot of the move occurred in a single week and that's what happens in the altcoin market right like you know people watch it and they think all right it's not going to drop it's doing okay and then you wake up one morning and and all Bitcoin pairs are down 20% and then the next day you think they're going to bounce and they's down another 20% again that's what happened in in 2019 right before rate Cuts arrived right and it never let it never let people get get you know to it it basically trapped the the altcoin holders because it dropped below support and everyone kept waiting for a bounce and it didn't bounce until 3 right it's at 0 4 right now it didn't bounce until 3 and then it only bounced back to35 before going back down to 0.25 so that's that's why I think that ultimately all Bitcoin pairs you're going to go down to here to 0.25 and they're currently at 04 which means that if I'm right alt Bitcoin pairs still have about a 37% drop ahead of them alt Bitcoin pairs 37 38% drop to get down to the range lows guys again if it can happen here in 2017 and if it can happen in 2019 and if it can happen in 2020 and if it can even happen in 2021 why can't that happen in 2024 you might say well Bitcoin is you know there's more to the market well I mean you know why did all Bitcoin pairs put in lower highs especially considering that you know stable coins are included why did it put in lower highs so you have to really think about you know what reason would cause them to go back up here before going back down here first right I think they will come back up here but I think they're going to go down here first so so with Bitcoin going back to you know to bitcoin the riskof signal in my opinion is the breakdown of all Bitcoin pairs I made a video about this you know every well I was about to say two days ago or something but I really I've made a video about this every day for last like two and a half years it's an if then statement again you know they still haven't technically broken down right I I can't I can't say they have again until you get a weekly close it's still just a wick you know until you get a weekly close eth Bitcoin it certainly seems like it's breaking down right but until you get a weekly close and really you want two weekly closes right I mean sometimes you get a weekly close and it's like a fake out until you really start to get those weekly closes below it it still kind of premature to sort of celebrate you know the the the theory being correct as much as I want to you know and it certainly seems like it's playing out I mean dominance put in new highs again right dominance excluding stable coins it is a Bitcoin dominance video right Bitcoin ex Bitcoin excluding stable coins put in new highs and if it goes to the top of this wedge here it means going all the way up to like 63 to 64% so if that's excluding Stables if you include Stables if it goes up you know 3 to 4% that puts it at 60% which is the that I've said forever that it's probably going to go to 60% is the 618 retracement of the uh of the fiber Trac it is the 618 is 60% that's exactly where dominance went last cycle from the breakdown point right it rallied to the 618 back then it was 72% 73% here it would be 60% it's not that far away right I mean we just got we just went up to the 0. five and when Bitcoin dominance rallied to the five in 2019 that marked the Top If Bitcoin Wicks higher next week it still marks the top right I mean three years from now you're not going to look back at it and say well actually you know you're say all I know to Mark the top again I don't know I don't know if it's going to do that or not next week I'm I'm open-minded right I'm certainly open-minded but I will say that I do think there is a strong case to be made that going into the summer you see a 30% correction right whether it is from 73k and it goes down to 50K or whether it's from you know 75k and it goes down to 52k I don't know I don't know but I do think there's a compelling case to be made that you will get a 30% correction before getting a a you know um um a sizable bounce and and actually that's what happened in 2019 is you had a 30% correction you had a 30% drop and then guess what Bitcoin rallied back up you know back almost to the to the highs and you know what's crazy about that is during that process guess what happened Bitcoin dominance kept going up kept going up and Bitcoin dominance did not top until Bitcoin fell below its bull market support band that's when it topped everyone keeps saying when's it going to top when's it going to top where is it going to top look at the last cycle Bitcoin dominance topped right here basically right right before right before Bitcoin fell below its bull Mark SP so that's probably when it tops but guess what we're still not there yet and you know you could still have a while of chopping around because I think that Bitcoin dominance is going to go to 60% and in order for it to do that it needs to chop the altcoin market up and the way that it does that is it just keeps bouncing around right because as it bounces around all Bitcoin pair keep going lower so remember what we said before all Bitcoin pairs go down no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD Bitcoin dominance goes up no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD it doesn't mean that Bitcoin can't go down it just means that dominance is going to go up no matter what so if you don't have a crystal ball like me if you don't have one if you do have one then you're not watch them anyways but if you don't have a crystal ball and you want exposure to crypto but you want like you you want to try to maximize your risk adjusted returns one thing to do during quantitative tightening and high interest rates is to say all right I'll just stay Bitcoin heavy and then I don't care what Bitcoin USD does but later on I can theoretically convert my Bitcoin to altcoins because the purchasing power of my Bitcoin to buy those altcoins will go up and isn't that true right look at these alts they're getting annihilated on their Bitcoin pairs you're getting absolutely destroyed Bitcoin gave you exposure to the upside so you get to enjoy the gains that come with it but you also get to say you know what if at some point I want to convert to alts some of my Bitcoin to alts after l loser monetary policy arrives you have the luxury to do so because you just stuck with Bitcoin and you said I don't know what Bitcoin USD is gonna do but when you're doing when you're in a period of high interest rates and quantitative tightening you're likely just going to see all Bitcoin pairs bleed and so now even if Bitcoin were to drop to 50K or even worse even if it were to go even lower in the summer which it could I mean I'm not going to say that it can't look at this I mean there's a lot of there's a lot of different metrics that you can look at look at what Bitcoin USD did after rate Cuts arrived in in 2019 it went back to the 100 we moving average you see that after after rate Cuts arrived here or as they arrived Bitcoin fell it fell 40% to the to the 100 we moving average you know I mean a 40 a 40% drop from here would put you at 43k right the 100 we SMA coincidentally is actually back here where we broke out in October of 2023 who's to say that can't happen but guess what even if it does happen you're still better off holding Bitcoin than holding alts for the most part and guess what there's also the idea of never let a good bubble go to waste right never let a good bubble go to waste and what that means is when you look at something like the risk levels for Bitcoin you don't know how high it's going to go you don't know I don't know we don't know if it's going to go to the higher wristband or if it's just going to top out on the 7 to point8 wristband right 2019 topped out right here so Far We've topped out between 7 to8 but you never let a good bubble go to waste right it's always worthwhile to take a little bit of profits anytime you get a major bubble whether it leads to new all-time highs or not right if if I just stick to the risk levels I'm like I don't know I don't know if it's going to go up higher or not but if you sell a little bit right if you sell like a small percentage as those bubbles form and you sell more and more as it goes higher then at least 6 or 12 months from now you can look look back and say all right well at these has like some profits right especially if you get a large pullback and by the way I mean one nice thing about a larger pullback would be that hey maybe it puts the whole left translated Cycle Theory to to bet you know um you know I'm still under the assumption here that that we're just a three quarter delay and you might say well a three quarter delay wouldn't that mean that that it would it would take longer than 20 25 no because if you measure it from the April top instead of November a 3/4 delay basically puts all Bitcoin pairs topping in January of 2026 exactly where they topped in 2018 January of 2018 right so it wouldn't be any different and if you don't believe me just look at all Bitcoin Pairs and look at them like this right let's let's just take a a bar pattern um if I can find it I do this all the time you think I know where it is if you look at all Bitcoin pairs here and you just say all right well if you shift this over like this or something guess what where does this potentially top out in q1 of 2026 which is where it topped out over here right and then what's more fascinating is that you still have this parallel Channel where alts are collectively bleeding back to bitcoin and then it plays out like it always does right and then maybe Bitcoin tops out in Q4 of the post having year just when it always does and once again everyone in crypto is making it more complicated than it needs to be you know the process that we experienced last cycle was a 9 month mon bare Market in sort of the middle of the cycle after a midcycle top we had a 9 month bare Market it was a six-month bare market and then we had the uh the pandemic right we had a recession induced by the pandemic after a midcycle top so if you do get a midcycle top right whether it's already in or whether you go slightly higher and then you get a six-month correction back to say like the 100 we moving average or maybe you get a recession and we go lower than that it's not impossible if it can happen over here why can't it happen again but even if that happens what does history show us history shows us that you can go from a low like 3,800 to a high like 64k in one year so even if you were to get a correction from April until December like 2019 happened after rate Cuts arrived you could still then see it right right you could still then see it rally back up and top out in late 2025 right so that's I I I think that's kind of the important thing that I keep going back to is that a lot of these things have been delayed by by three quarters and I know there's been a lot of people that have been very much against all this monetary policy stuff and saying it doesn't affect crypto how about now I mean you know how about now that that all Bitcoin pairs are are are bleeding and and a lot of these altcoins are you know again not that far off their lows so we'll see what happens you know we'll see what happens in the week of the hav um I'm open-minded you know I'm open-minded my main conviction is the dominance is going to 60% and after it goes to 60% I think there will will be another correction after that right you know the process to going to 60% could be like what happened in 2019 where it just kind of chops around for a couple of months um that could be the process that gets you to 60% dominance and then you could see all USD valuations go down after all Bitcoin pairs bottom because Bitcoin USD gets your correction so that is something I think you look for later this year right 60% dominance as Bitcoin kind of chops around up in this range then maybe a deeper correction sometime later this year followed by a reason for the FED to turn on the money printer and then the markets go back up but when the FED turns on the money printer and then go back to lose monetary policy then guess what happens then altcoins lead Bitcoin then what happens then altcoins go up against Bitcoin no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD what has it been for the last two and a half years what has it been for the last two and a half years I've said it a thousand times right I've said it a thousand times my it's been all Bitcoin pairs go down no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD that's been the view right they go down no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD but once you go from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing all Bitcoin pairs bottom and then they go up with the exception of maybe the final you know a blowoff top for Bitcoin USD but then they go up no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD after the FED starts to cut rates so you could get to a situation where all Bitcoin pairs go up for a few months but all USD pairs are going down because Bitcoin USD is going down right right what have we seen\n",

      "no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD but once you go from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing all Bitcoin pairs bottom and then they go up with the exception of maybe the final you know a blowoff top for Bitcoin USD but then they go up no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD after the FED starts to cut rates so you could get to a situation where all Bitcoin pairs go up for a few months but all USD pairs are going down because Bitcoin USD is going down right right what have we seen for the last 2 and a half years we've seen all USD pairs we've seen all Bitcoin pairs go down no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD for the last few months we've seen all USD pairs go up because Bitcoin USD was going up but all Bitcoin pairs were going down you could see the reverse of that after rate Cuts right you could see alt USD pairs go down but all Bitcoin pairs go up and then on the last rate cut and the shift from quantitative Titan in quantitative easing then alt Bitcoin pairs then alt USD pairs go up a lot right and then you get the alt season that you've been dreaming of but I don't you know I I still think that that all season that you want is still a little ways off right I still think it's a little ways off um so yeah I mean those are my views the other thing to look at with Bitcoin um is the 8we Okay so so you know if if the Bulls want a compelling reason to get a strong rally into the having then I think you have to see an eight-week estimate a close above the eight-week moving average right the 8we SMA is at 65.5k right now Bitcoin is at 63.7k so the they they you know the Bulls have some time to try to get back above 8 week even if they close below it technically it doesn't necessarily mean anything unless you get another close below it so like let's say you get a close below it and then you get another close below it then it could be somewhat problematic um but that's where the 8we estimate is and and then the bullmark sport band of course is is all the way down here so a lot of things I mean a lot of things to consider and and you know I mean the initial reaction off the bullmark sport band you know could be a bounce I me we we saw that back over here in 2019 but one of the issues is that you could you know are we too far gone has it been too long since we tested it and sometimes when that happens you you then fall below it for a a you know a few months before you can try to get back above it so we'll see I think all these are going to be topics we're going to be dealing with this summer right in the meantime I still think there's going to be kind of a big question mark for like the next week or two as the having sort of comes into play and but then as we get into like May and June and July I I think we're going to be sort of wrestling with with Bitcoin getting back to the bullmark sport band um and it could be a combination of of the bullmark sport band going up and and then Bitcoin sort of just chopping around in this range until it finally you know gets down to the bullmark sport band and then from there um if it were to play out like 2019 then you could get a brief downtrend below it until until there's you know until loer monetary policy arrives in Mass right not just a token rate cut not just a 25 basis point no one cares rate cut but a 200 basis point rate cut you know a 200 basis point rate rate cut is what leads to that kind of stuff in QE right a 25 basis point rate cut can still lead to this right you don't believe me just look at us interest rates look at what happened last cycle when they cut 25 basis points look what Bitcoin did Bitcoin did not give a flying you know what when the when the FED cut 25 basis points you know they cut here and then they cut again here and then they cut again here and Bitcoin just went down and then Bitcoin then we had a recession induced by black swine admittedly and then the FED cut a lot and then Bitcoin was like oh free money new highs so those are my views right um those are my views and I I do think that with altcoins it's it's this it's this area right here where they get really interesting right and another area another way to look at that is to look at the social risk right look at where look at the social risk is at 0.8 5 where did altcoins get really interesting last cycle where did they bottom out did they bottom out when the social risk bottom out no they didn't social risk bottom out when the FED paused rates social risk here bottomed out when the FED paused rates social risk went up and then social risk went back down put in a higher low and when social risk put in a higher low guess what happened all Bitcoin pairs bottomed so that is coming probably this summer where all Bitcoin pairs come back down here right and they bought them during the dog days of the summer and then in here you'll likely see all Bitcoin pairs bottom and then all USD pairs will go down commen it with Bitcoin USD so then what essentially happens is that like you know it's not as clear that Bitcoin is has the best risk adjusted returns because all Bitcoin pairs have bottomed out right for the last two and a half years Bitcoin has because all Bitcoin pairs are in a downtrend but if they if all Bitcoin pairs bottom out then you get to a point where Bitcoin you know you know then you get to a point where you're like well these these all are down so much and now you're going back to ler monetary policy right and then you get to the point where yeah you're going to take on more risk to buy an altcoin but there's a lot more reward for the last 2 and a half years it's been well altcoins are more risk and you're getting less reward yes I know there's some that have outperformed Bitcoin but collectively they have bled against Bitcoin so that is kind of the shift in the cryptoverse that's probably going to happen in the next 3 to six months and that is ultimately where you know I I think we're headed um and I I think a lot of the charts support that view and uh we will just kind of see what happens going into into the summer right we'll see what happens going into the summer and um you know we'll see what happens with Bitcoin the week of the Havoc my guess is that you know something's going to happen in the market where you know it it's gonna it's going to like throw people a curveball or something but it's dangerous at this point for you know for alts because eth Bitcoin looks like it's breaking down Bitcoin dominance is breaking out so you know I I even if Bitcoin gets a bounce all that it would do is just wreck altcoins even more on their Bitcoin pairs yes alts would go up on their USD pairs if Bitcoin bounced but they would just get wrecked on their Bitcoin Pairs and that is all that matters right I'm gonna I'm not gonna I'm not going on the ti rate forever but for a few more weeks right that is all that matters is their Bitcoin pairs so let's look to see if Bitcoin dominance can make that move to 60% we've hit a lot of the thresholds that we've said gold has broken out eth Bitcoin has broken down but not convincingly yet because it's not a weekly close all Bitcoin pairs still at 04 you need to see them at 39 if they're at 39 and Below that's probably it for the altcoin market for a while for at least three to six months okay it's a riskof signal like it more than likely just like it was last cycle so you have all Bitcoin pairs close to breaking down you have e Bitcoin that's already technically broken down we just need a weekly close to confirm you have others Bitcoin which just took out all of its gains since the summer of 2023 you have blue chip dominance which is near 73% which is the riskof signal that still needs to happen and it probably will happen the week at the having you have gold that broke out long ago it's already at 2300 which was you know a a potential shift in the cryptoverse you have usdt dominance which hit the same trend line it always hit hits that bounces off of that doesn't mean it can't come back down and hit it again just like it did over here in 2021 but this is the same trend line it always bounces off of and if it does come back down and bounce off this trend line in April or May guess what maybe Bitcoin went higher but alt usds alt USD pair is probably just put in a lower a lower high right so you have to be careful I mean this is one of those things where I feel like a lot of people got into trouble in 20121 and I'm trying to like say I I want to be more open-minded because in 2021 Bitcoin the risk metric that use it hit the highest wristband in like you know in February or March and then it went slightly higher in April right and so it it sort of Drew a lot of people in and they're like oh well the RIS magic is wrong and it just drew a lot of people in just for it to only go like another one or $2,000 higher and then it still came crashing down so you know I would say be somewhat open-minded about that but in 2021 you can see we only tagged it once in 2020 we only tagged it once in June 2019 which is kind of like where we are now I think it only tagged it once a lot of times where it only really tagged it once but at least you know 2021 can show you that sometimes you can ride that trend line for several months so be open-minded but that is the trend line that it is always bounced off of and perhaps this time is not any different right just perhaps so those are the things that I think we are looking at and one more thing I know a lot of people keep saying well rate CS aren't going to happen until September right what have I said forever forever the pricing out of rate Cuts will likely cause them to get priced back in we've gone from six rate Cuts priced for 2024 down to now only two and look what happened when we went from six to two all Bitcoin pairs are getting annihilated does the FED care about all Bitcoin pairs no hell no but they care about the consumer and the consumer the the the the glimpse into the consumer can be seen through the altcoin market because we're all D jenss at Heart Right deep down even the Bitcoin Maxis there's a little bit of a Deen among us all because even Bitcoin is risky you know it's not like it hasn't doesn't have any risk every every few years it drops like 80% so there's there's you know there's a d gen we're all we're all sort of um Deens at heart so keep an eye on that right keep an eye on on that as well uh as we you know as we continue to um uh go forward here and and my guess is that you know I mean I mean just a couple days ago the the market was saying not no rate cut until September now it's saying no rate cut until July but with this selloff with this selloff um I could easily see that being shifted to June easily in fact I'll tell you something crazy if I were not looking at this if I were not looking at at this at all and I didn't see what the market thought like only a 6% chance of a rate cut in May if I didn't see that and I was just looking at this then I would be tempted to say they might cut in May as crazy as that sounds and the only reason I say that is because if you look at all Bitcoin pairs last cycle the FED legitimately cut like just a couple of weeks after they broke down right I mean really right here like the all Bitcoin pairs broke down the into June and then the FED cut in July so if I were only looking at all Bitcoin pairs assuming they break down which they technically haven't yet but if they do and I were only looking at this I would say the FED is going to cut in May but I'm not just looking at that I'm also looking at what smarter people than me think and they're saying no rate cut in May and the FED has said no rate cut in May for the most part I mean like they they've all sort of like walked it back you know but watch what the FED does or watch what the FED does not what they say I don't know I mean I'm guessing it's not going to happen in May but I will say this that if it doesn't happen in May that doesn't mean it's the right decision it could be a policy mistake for them not to cut in May and you might say well how can you say that inflation just came in and it's so hot right how can you say that it's true that inflation is hot but monetary policy operates with long and variable lags it does and it when it drops it can drop quickly and a lot of the reason this has gone up if you look at contributions per category it was because housing went up you know if you look at headline inflation and you look at at the contribution that came from the housing market it's mostly housing housing makes up two of the three and a half% and that's a lagging market right that's a lagging Market housing lags so I I look there good chance are not going to cut in May but I'm just saying if I were only looking at all Bitcoin pairs assuming they break down either this week or next I would say they're going to they they probably should cut in May if all Bitcoin PS bounce again and we kick the can down the road once again then fine you know fine but if I only look at that I would say they need to cut in May they're probably not going to cut in May and maybe they don't in June but the longer guys remember I know the monetary policy stuff doesn't interest a lot of people and a lot of people are saying they're hellbent on no rate cuts at all this year but I will just say this in 2022 when everyone was telling you that there's no way they were going to go above three and a half% and I said the terminal rate is likely at 5 a half% now it seems like I'm the one saying we're going to see rate Cuts before most people think and now all the comments are saying they're not going to cut this year the FED reacts a lot quicker than I think investors think they will you know and and I I I think when no one thought they were going to go to 5 a half% they did did and now so many people think they're not going to cut this year or it might only be one cut and I I think they're going to cut I do I really do think they're going to cut because all it takes is the pricing out of rate cuts to cause them to get price back in because people throw in the towel and when people give up when the consumer gives up that's when the FED comes to the rescue that's when they come to the rescue one everyone is finally given up so that's what I think awaits us this summer those are my views on bitcoin USD I'm open-minded at Bitcoin USD going into the week of they having especially considering what happened in their spotf counter points that it topped out eth topped out a month before the merge is possible Bitcoin tops out a month before the having um so don't discount that idea but also don't take that to the bank we saw Bitcoin go to the range lows a week before the spot ETF so far this is the same thing main difference is that a week before the spotf it also swept the high this time it was a bit weaker didn't sweep the high the reason I think it didn't sweep the high and go above it is because all Bitcoin pairs are breaking down and back then they weren't right back then e Bitcoin was above support adaa Bitcoin was above support dot Bitcoin was above support madic Bitcoin was above support back in January today they're below support and so I think that is the reason why Bitcoin did not sweep the high and that was why it was a little bit weaker lastek week than it was the corresponding week in January a week before the spot ETF it all comes back to liquidity and the jaws of liquidity opened long ago long ago and I told you guys many many times that you cannot use liquidity to tell you where all or where risk assets are going on their USD pairs if you look at at at at this you can see the Jaws opened long ago but you know where the Jaws never opened up on all Bitcoin pairs because all Bitcoin pairs show you that liquidity has been getting sucked out of the cryptoverse just because Bitcoin USD went up doesn't mean liquidity wasn't getting sucked out Bitcoin USD went up because all people were converting their alts to bitcoin as liquidity goes down all USD all bit coin Pais have gone down it's not unique to crypto this isn't some type of like major breakthrough in in in with investing I think it's just there's a lot of investors in crypto that are not as familiar with how things work in traditional markets but the same thing happens there look at the Russell divided by the NASDAQ it also has been bleeding because these micro cap companies keep bleeding to Nvidia apple and Microsoft and Google right it's the same exact thing the jaws of liquidity open for risk assets on their USD pairs but the jaws of liquidity have not opened for risk assets on their Blue Chip pairs so all Bitcoin pairs rivan Tesla pair lucid Tesla pair right jaws of liquidity never opened there but they opened on the S&P they opened on bitcoin because people go from high risk to low risk during Tighter and Tighter monetary policy and that I think is where we find ourselves today so look for Bitcoin to chop around for the next month or two go to 60% Bitcoin dominance eventually go back to the bullmark sport band whether we put in on you know whether we go back up or not between now and then I don't know and then from there I think you know we'll probably fall below it at some point and then when we fall below it we find out what the fed's going to do for um you know for for risk assets and then once they start printing again then we'll likely go back up um but then we just kind of worry of did they stay the course long enough to avoid a second wave of inflation so I was wondering if I could um there was there was something I posted um Le said I can post this to uh post this on here so I'm going to try to grab this we'll see if this works okay so I I I posted this to ITC premium back in January January 2nd of 2024 These are My Views These are My Views if my views on the market are correct and they never are you can see I was I was um you know showing a lot of confidence right if my views are on the market are correct and never are then I would say Bitcoin USD stays strong until approximately 56% dominance which occurs before the First Rate cut arrives right we're at 56% First Rate has not arrived at 56% dominance e Bitcoin is broken below 049 right we just saw that it's below 049 we still need the weekly close the FED starts to cut in H1 2024 I don't know right are they going to cut in May or June maybe not may could be June we'll see it I mean it could be July that statement could be wrong people celebrating in by RIS gas because LCI monetary policy has arrived unfortunately at 25 to 50 base points do nothing to sa the labor market just like it didn't just like it didn't help crypto in 2019 the first 25 base Point rate cut Market just went down if anything it's an acknowledgement by the FED that the economy is weakening and the FED is being unwilling to cut enough to change the trend then Bitcoin gets a big drop and during that drop Bitcoin dominance goes to 6% because the king of the alts eth has broken down it no longer has any hiding places on its Bitcoin pair and it's free to drop to the 0.3 to 04 range even on a Bitcoin USD drop because dominance is at 60% people start buying alts thinking they bottomed against Bitcoin and they probably have but then their USD valuations go down commencer it with Bitcoin USD because the F fed is still unwilling to cut enough and finally risk assets you know these altcoins Co find a bottom and then we spend the next year wondering if they stayed the course long enough to keep inflation from coming back in a second wave so you could get an example right where the FED doesn't cut they don't cut they don't cut or they don't print and then finally like all right we'll print and then the markets go back up and then a year later we're like oh crap another wave of inflation now we have to have another bare market right something like that could happen again this is one potential narrative I come up with many plausible narratives as well there's\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the social risk if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe crypt.of in the lower rate between now and then so make sure check that out links in the description below the social risk right now is. 262 if you're unfamiliar with the social risk it is insight into interest within the cryptoverse by tracking social trends both on YouTube and on X forly Twitter so we're looking at YouTube views YouTube subscribers to various crypto YouTube channels and then followers to various analysts exchang and layer ones on X and when you look at all of them if we overlay all of those individual components that's what they look like and then what we do is we then combine them into one and it looks like this so the social risk goes from zero to one when it's near zero it means there's very little interest in the cryptoverse when it's near one it means there's a lot of interest in the cryptoverse and you're probably looking at a market cycle top right now I'm arguing that if this is going to play out like last cycle then it could still be quite as quite some time before you see the social risk durably go up like this it doesn't mean it won't it just means it could be much further off like it might not happen immediately just like in 2019 right it it didn't happen immediately now again it goes from 0 to one so zero is low risk one is high- risk right now we're sort of you know we're at 262 now for a long time we've only tracked about 10 channels when looking at at YouTube subscribers and YouTube views and about the same number of Twitter accounts we've actually expanded that now and I want to show you what the new charts look like so if we go over to charts and we go to YouTube subscribers to all of these YouTube channels so instead of only looking at 10 now we've got I think somewhere between 30 to 40 a lot more YouTube channels this was a commonly requested thing a lot of people said hey can you add this channel can you add that channel so I basically just went through a lot of the recommendations that I saw and I was like all right well we'll just add a lot of these channels so that hopefully we can get better Insight right better insight into what's going on um you know in the cryptoverse what's going on in the retail space are people interested and you know some of these channels um are it's taking a little bit of time to load some of these channels are are you know Bitcoin only channels some of them are you know they focus on altcoins there's like a a different array of channels that we have so we're not looking at only one specific thing and so if we go look at all these different channels if it ever decides to load um there it is we look at all these different channels you can see that it's actually gone up quite a bit over the last few months but ever since early March subscribers have been sort of dropping back down as price has not really moved Okay now what's interesting is that was one caveat we only have data for the new channels three up to three years ago so you can kind of see there's a period where we don't have as many channels we only have like 10 or 11 channels and then right here we have a lot more it's because we can only get the data so far that we can find 3 years back so un Ely that's just something we have to live with at this point um but you can see kind of like what it looks like since then at these highs which did include these other channels you can see that these Subs these channels were getting about 60,000 new subscribers a day on average right now they're getting about 7,000 okay so about an order of magnitude difference not that long ago though we did hit that 20,000 subscriber level now we have the same chart uh but for YouTube views to those same crypto YouTube channels and so by looking at YouTube views it it it also gives you some insight into like are the people that are already subscribed are they still watching um and if you look at it like this you can see there was a bit of an uptick recently back up to 2 million the high over here was around 4 million but it has sort of fallen off recently as the price hasn't really done anything um for the last month or so right you can see that Bitcoin found this local top at least March mid-march price hasn't really done anything since and so because it hasn't done anything you can see that views have have sort of fallen off here right they they've been cut in half in fact and we've also done something similar with Twitter followers so we've added a lot of new ex uh crypto X accounts that you know that a lot of you guys are probably familiar with and you can look at something very similar very very similar to YouTube views but over for for x or formally Twitter and see that you know at these Peaks over here we have this data going all the way back to 2017 at these Peak over here you can see that in fact uh these new followers to these Twitter accounts essentially did a pretty decent job right did a pretty decent job of actually marking the top when that topped right you can see it right there um but you know ever since then you know it fell down a lot and over here basically we had about 100,000 new followers to those crypto Twitter accounts in a single day now they're averaging only a few thousand and recently it's actually negative the reason it's negative is I think there was something weird that happened on on X where like it it basically gave a lot of people a lot of people got a lot of new subscribers in like a day it seemed like something weird was going on and then like the next day a lot of those subscribers were taken away if you look at uh at just my account right you can see there was a spike on it um and I I think we need to look at not a 7-Day moving average right there was a spike here and then there was a big move to the downside and I'm not really sure what happened there but you can see across a lot of the different channels right like if you look at at altcoin Daily's Channel you will see it if you look at my channel you'll see it if you look at at coin bu like it seemed to be like a a something you know completely Twitter wide right like it happened to a lot of these accounts on Twitter and I'm not really sure why but you you can see it sort of across the board there on a lot of those different accounts including my own um but because that happened it's now kind of messed with the uh the social risk at least in the short term because if you look at at Twitter followers to say analysts or exchanges it caused this like artificial Spike that probably shouldn't really be there but it is there so we live with it I'm not going to I'm not going to take it out if you look at the social risk though you can see that while it did get that pop up into the 04 to.5 risk band it's actually come right back down one of the things that's interesting we like to tie a lot of these things that we talk about over to monetary policy and I know a lot of people have spent a long time sort of debating that monetary policy might not be as useful for the cryptoverse I think it is and I think the fact that the Bitcoin dominance has gone up once again and put in new cycle highs is evidence that monetary policy really does affect the cryptoverse despite many people's best attempt to try to explain that it doesn't um but if you look at at monetary policy as it relates to the social risk you actually find quite an interesting Trend which gives more evidence to suggest that we are you know in a in a quantitative tightening High interest rate period where social risk while it does go up sometimes it still just kind of Fades back down because we're still not in Q we're still at low rates if you look at the social risk in 2018 you can see that it bottomed right here right what's interesting about where this bottomed and if you pull up Bitcoin and you look at late 2018 that was where the FED paused now look at where social risk found this low in September when did the FED pause rates right in like July July you can see right here July was that that last one and then August um we had you know we had a pause so you'll see that in both cases social interest found a low when the FED paused and it makes sense because a lot of times when the FED pauses risk assets rally for a while because they they're they're celebrating the fact that they were're done with rate hikes right and when that happens prices go up and when prices go up retail comes back back and you can see that retail has come back to some degree just like they did in 2019 however there's an issue where what if you know they came back just like they did over here but then what if we sort of enter into something like this where social interest sort of Fades for a b because you can see the minute that price doesn't even do anything social risk just drops Like a Rock right it drops Like a Rock whereas over here when price really wasn't doing much and just kind of going sideways social risk R was still going up so this was during low interest rates in QE this was during High interest rates in QT and so when you're in high interest rates in QT you really need price action to just keep going up on almost daily basis to keep people interested um otherwise people just start tuning out again and you kind of see that's what's happening again it doesn't mean that Bitcoin can't go higher of course I mean until all Bitcoin pairs break down it could theoretically do that remember last cycle Bitcoin topped out when all Bitcoin pairs broke down and we are getting close but it hasn't happened yet right we are getting relatively close to them breaking down just like they did over here but it hasn't happened yet and when they do break down assuming that they do I imagine the FED will cut not too long after that just like they did last cycle but the reason we can tile this together is to say well look if if we are about to enter into a phase like this as we get into the summer I don't really know what's going to happen in April specifically but if this kind of happens in the Summer where we just sort of price just kind of like moves around a little bit maybe some lower highs or something in May and June and social risk falls off the cliff the reason why that's important is because if you go over to the workbench and pull up Bitcoin dominance and we look just at Bitcoin dominance without stable coins and add social risk onto this chart one of the things you'll notice is that as the social risk stays low Bitcoin dominance still goes up and Bitcoin dominance still went up even after the social risk had this rally after rate after the after the FED Pauls rates in 2019 and then the social risk fell off but Bitcoin dominance still went up and Bitcoin dominance topped out after the social risk sort of came back over here and and you know more or less put in a double bottom right so what I'm suggesting here is that as we get out into the summer and as we get closer and closer to R Cuts you might actually see the social risk fall back in to the 0 to 0.2 range where altcoins you know go to whatever lows they're going to go to on their Bitcoin pairs I've often said I don't think they're done bleeding against Bitcoin and you can see very clearly that that has been true today Bitcoin dominance put in the highest daily close that it's had for the entire cycle right this is the highest daily close since April 2021 eth Bitcoin put in its lowest daily close since April of 2021 adaa Bitcoin put in its lowest daily close since January of 2021 dot Bitcoin put in its lowest close ever madic Bitcoin has put in its lowest daily close since April of 2021 so with all of that in mind with all that in mind it sort of seems like it is in fact playing out like last cycle everything is just delayed by about three quarters right because we know that last cycle all Bitcoin pairs collapsed in in the summer of 2019 it now seems like we're potentially doing the same thing about three quarters later so it's a very interesting setup and I'm wondering if it's just going to play out exactly the same way where these all Bitcoin paries break down and the reason they break down is because retail just isn't back yet in the way that people think they're going to be back I think a lot of people think well Bitcoin new all-time highs you know they think that means alt season but the reality is we're still in quantitative tightening we're still at a high interest rate macro environment and so rather than retail immediately returning they just leave again and therefore dominance of Bitcoin just keeps going up so it makes a lot of sense when you think about it is if you want to see social risk go up or if you want to see Bitcoin dominance go down durably you need a lot lot of retail investors to come and frankly buy your altcoin bags who are we kidding that's what you need but if you're not getting that if if if if retail just they kind of tune in when the price moves and they immediately tune out if price stabilizes then you don't have that same purchasing power to buy up the altcoins to durably send Bitcoin dominance back down therefore if you don't have that as long as the social risk is low or trending down then the Bitcoin dominance generally goes up right and you can see here that social risk topped in May of 2021 now you might say well Ben I hate to break it to you but Bitcoin dominance didn't bottom until you know September 2022 while that may be true including stable coins you can actually calculate out Bitcoin dominance excluding stable coins and see that it actually bottomed in May of 2021 precisely when the social risk topped so Bitcoin dominance tops when social risk finds these lows potentially these secondary lows over here and it bottoms Bitcoin dominance bottoms when the social risk tops it's kind of interesting right it makes a lot of sense when you think about it right you need retail investors to to be interested in alts to make the dominance go down durably if you don't have that then you know all the all the moves down by dominance they just end up eventually breaking out because you still don't have retail coming back so that's why social risk is so interesting and my base case again I don't know if Bitcoin might get another move into the having it certainly could considering that all Bitcoin pairs have not broken down yet but there's no guarantee remember eth USD topped out a month before the merge um but if we do see kind of like a a summer lull again that kind of seems to be a repetitive thing in the cryptoverse where summer gets gets here and then it gets kind of boring if that happens and you see the social risk just sort of drop back down into these lows then that might actually correspond to bitcoin dominance uh topping out but I don't think we're there yet I I think we still need a few more months to get there to see the social risk come back down and it's this move sorry I bug just land on it's this move here where it comes back down which really makes people question you know all the all the altcoin bags that they're holding and then it kind of you know it gets kind of overwhelming and and then they you know they finally convert to bitcoin and by the time the last person actually converts to bitcoin then the Bitcoin dominance finally tops out and then altcoins start to take back over um for a while but again I don't think we're there yet I I still think you're likely going to see the social risk go down into the summer even if Bitcoin does push to new highs I think the social risk is likely going to go down into the summer months um just like it did over here as as as rate Cuts arrived and as that happens you should see a lot of these alts break support against Bitcoin I know they haven't yet done it collectively like all Bitcoin pairs haven't broken support but we are getting relatively close and individually a lot of these altcoins are breaking support right eth Bitcoin while it hasn't had a weekly close below 049 it is getting relatively close to doing so a to bitcoin I just made a video on this I said I think it's going to break support it has dot Bitcoin has broken support madic Bitcoin has broken support So it seems like a lot of the individual altcoins are breaking support it's just a matter of time before total 3 minus USD divided by Bitcoin breaks support others Bitcoin which a lot of people have used to try to be more optimistic on the altcoin market today had a wick down where it gave up all the gains that it had since October of 2023 so you can see just how quickly a lot of these altcoins can get wiped out their their Bitcoin gains can get wiped out practically overnight um when when you get these wash out periods and and it makes a lot of sense because last cycle others Bitcoin dropped 60% Rose 60 and then dropped another 60 as rate Cuts arrived what happens if we do the same thing drop 60 go up 60 and then drop 60 as rate Cuts arrive as the social risk goes back down into the summer and the Bitcoin dominance goes up to to um this is this is excluding Stables but including Stables as the Bitcoin dominance goes up to that 60% level right I've said for a long time at 56% dominance e Bitcoin should get a weekly close below 0049 it seems like it's all lining up right we're getting a close to 56% dominance we already went above it but until we get a weekly close it doesn't matter just like eth Bitcoin needs to get a weekly close below .49 for it to mean something it seems like it's all lining up it all seems to be lining up right around the having we do know that that April does tend to be a time where Bitcoin can get some excitement and then it cools off into May we've seen that happen we saw it happen in 2021 we saw it happen last year we saw it happen in 2013 if something like that were to happen and and Bitcoin sort of cools off into the May time frame and social risk goes back down then I think everything we've spoken about over the last two and a half years finally comes to fruition um in this final Crescendo where all Bitcoin pairs break down the social risk goes back down social risk potentially puts in like you know a double bottom sometime later this year as Bitcoin dominance tops out and then and then finally we get to rate Cuts where where things turn around for the altcoin market at least on their their Bitcoin pairs but I think that's kind of a way that you tie in the social risk into the cryptoverse you know and I I think it's fascinating I don't really think um a lot of people use you know this sort of stuff but how how fascinating is it that social risk topped when Bitcoin dominance bottomed and how fascinating is it that last cycle Bitcoin dominance topped after social risk sort of put in a a double bottom on the secondary bottom that's when Bitcoin dominants topped we put in the first low on social risk as rate cut arai or as the as the FED pause rates I'm arguing that it comes back down again as rate Cuts arrive and does something like this and then somewhere over here somewhere over here later on this year you know Bitcoin dominance theoretically tops as the social rail goes back down into those lower levels um as you know as those rate Cuts come in because the Fed trying to figure out how much damage they did I think you know I'm trying to tie it all together you know I I I don't want there to be you know anything that we're not I mean it really is a holistic view right you're you're talking about retail interest but you also want to tie it over to monetary policy because we know at this point you know there have been arguments about it forever but I think we can safely say at this point that monetary policy does affect the cryptoverse and I know it seems obvious\n",

      "The existing summary is: The video transcript discusses the concept of \"social risk\" in the cryptocurrency market, which is a metric that tracks interest and engagement within the crypto space. The presenter argues that the current social risk level of 0.262 suggests that there is still room for the market to run, as the social risk has not yet reached the high-risk territory near 1.0 that typically signals a market cycle top.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presenter has expanded the number of YouTube channels and Twitter accounts tracked to provide a more comprehensive view of retail interest. The data shows that while subscriber growth and view counts for crypto YouTube channels have declined from their peaks, they are still elevated compared to previous lows. Similarly, the growth in Twitter followers for crypto-related accounts has slowed, with some accounts even seeing negative growth due to what appears to be a platform-wide issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presenter ties the social risk metric to monetary policy, noting that it tends to bottom when the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, as investors become more willing to take on risk. However, the presenter argues that in the current high-interest rate, quantitative tightening environment, the social risk may struggle to maintain elevated levels unless Bitcoin price continues to make new highs on a regular basis. Otherwise, the presenter suggests that the social risk could fall back into the 0.0-0.2 range, which would likely coincide with a further increase in Bitcoin dominance as altcoins bleed against BTC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presenter believes that this scenario, if it plays out, would be similar to the 2019 market cycle, where Bitcoin dominance topped out after the social risk put in a secondary bottom. The presenter suggests that this could happen again later this year as the Fed eventually cuts rates, potentially marking the end of the current Bitcoin dominance cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the transcript presents a bearish near-term outlook for altcoins, with the presenter arguing that the current macro environment and lack of sustained retail interest could lead to further underperformance of altcoins against Bitcoin. However, the presenter also suggests that this could set the stage for an eventual altcoin resurgence once the Fed shifts to a more accommodative policy stance.\n",

last did a dedicated video on cardano I mostly just speak about Bitcoin or sometimes we'll Branch out to ethereum we'll do stuff on on you know the macroverse we'll do stuff on bitcoin dominance I don't do a ton of videos on individual altcoins and the reason I haven't I will explain later in the video but you should know that while most of the stuff I talk about on this channel most of the charts that I present are on bitcoin for instance this is the end of the cryptoverse website and we've got thousands of different charts but if you click on any individual chart let's say the hotle waves for example the default is for it to show Bitcoin right and you can go look at the long-term holders for Bitcoin however while we have a lot of these charts for Bitcoin and I spend most of my time communicating what Bitcoin is doing you should know that the website has a lot more functionality than that and if you click on assets up here you can find a list of a lot of different crypto cryptocurrencies for a lot of different charts that then you can pull up that chart for that cryptocurrency so in this case you're looking at long-term holder hotle waves for cardano so my goal in this video is to go through a lot of different charts explain what My Views have previously been talk about what I've been right about and what I have been wrong about um try to be as Fair as possible and that's my goal one thing to do by the way on the website if you do have access to it one cool thing you can do that I think many people might not know is that if you go over to the asset filter you can just actually click on you know any number of cryptocurrencies right we have a hundreds of different cryptocurrencies on here but if you want to click on say cardano or whatever you're interested in it will then load the charts that we have for that asset right so then you can see all these charts where you know if you just want to click on any random one let's say days since percentage gain you know how long has it been since Ada went up 100% it'll show you that chart right and then you can just click back and you can go to another chart if you want um but it's a pretty cool feature uh you know we've been trying to build this out as best we can for you know a lot of different cryptocurrencies so in this video I'm going to talk about again where I think you know what I think is the important thing to look at and I want to explain my bias on this so my bias and again it's not anything against Ada my bias since 2022 began has been that altcoins will bleed to bitcoin that has been my view I've said it a thousand times probably more than a thousand times most everyone's going to know that that has been my view right and and a is no exception I I I I do think that it has been following the general path so that is something that has been playing out I wanted to make this video now because Ada Bitcoin is at a pretty crucial level okay and we're going to talk a lot about that it's at a pretty crucial level right now it's approaching 800 sets approaching 800 sets so in general my view is that when we get to a phase of the market cycle where we can identify it as a a region where Bitcoin dominance is going to go up which is what I came to the conclusion of back over here I was very very bullish on bitcoin dominance really starting over here once I came to the conclusion that Bitcoin dominance was going to go from about 40% up to 60% what I have said relentlessly is that alts will bleed back to bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance will go up now so far that has been playing out out collectively there are some altcoins that have been outperforming Bitcoin but what you may notice is that a lot of the larger market cap altcoins have been bleeding and it's not just cardano right it's not just Ada it's a lot of them I mean look at look at ethereum you see how Ada Bitcoin is testing support guess what e Bitcoin is testing support dot Bitcoin is testing support it's kind of already below support right mad Bitcoin already lost support so it's nothing specific about ADA I mean I see a lot of different narratives running around all that sort of stuff and and the narratives can can certainly seem convincing at at certain stages of the cycle but I want to tell you why I don't think any of those narratives matter and I'm going to tell you what I think does matter and it all comes down for me to monetary policy and and the the overall Trends in the dominance of Bitcoin okay so I want you to think back over the last couple of years for Ada all right think about every narrative there has been about the Ada EV valuation against Bitcoin and again I've been bearish on it for a long time but I want you to think about every narrative there has been has anything turned it around not yet we'll see if it can but it hasn't happened yet and I want to show you what happened last cycle that actually turned around right where did at a Bitcoin bottom last cycle well it bottomed at 400 sets before that it was also at around 400 sets actually less than that it was all the way down at 270 SATs so 270 then it went up to to 400 now one of the things that I've received a lot of criticism for over the last couple of years is that a lot of people are are assuming that ADA Bitcoin will hold support on this trend line or at least we assuming that it would hold support it's starting to look like that might not be the case and I've been clear that my base case is that it does go below 800 STS that is my base case um but what actually caused it to bottom that is what we're interested in here right there's a thousand different narratives we can come up with you can talk about the community all you want none of that stuff matters right I me we can talk about community community community but I mean it that stuff is just you know it's it's it just doesn't matter you know it it doesn't and one of the things that I I I think is is very important with alt coins is what causes them to turn around is it the narratives in the media is it you know whatever the most recent YouTuber said including me you know it's not based on any of that stuff what if it's simply based on whether we're in a period of quantitative tightening or quantitative easing now unfortunately we only have one data point to go off of so I'm not asking you to take this to the bank at least as far as crypto is concerned but if you look up thousands of here thousands of years of monetary policy history you will in fact see that during higher interest rate environments higher risk assets bleed to lower risk assets and why is that it's because we can be more confident that something like Bitcoin Will Survive over a longer period of time than we can any altcoin right I mean I think that's I think most people would agree with that if you go back to 2013 you know Bitcoin was number one if you look at 2011 you know I mean every year Bitcoin has been number one ethereum has been number two right I mean for the last several years going back to like you know the last cycle back in like 2017 when it overtook others to to take that spot but it's been pretty clear that Bitcoin kind of stays around altcoins come and go now some altcoins go put in new highs in future cycles and some of them don't one thing about cardano last cycle that made me interested in it in 2019 was that it I I thought it had bottomed out against Bitcoin right and that was why I was interested in it back then was because I thought it had bottomed out against Bitcoin in a Bitcoin USD downtrend and so that made me interested in it and then it was one of the few altcoins from the prior cycle that was able to take out its high there have been a lot of altcoins that didn't take out their highs or the ones that did only went marginally above them so it's important to recognize that a lot of altcoins can become relics in future Cycles so if you are going to get on on board with one you really hope it's not going to be a relic right and that's why I say never marry an altcoin because you're going to take half in the divorce don't marry an altcoin that's my non-financial advice so what caused adaa to bottom against Bitcoin what caused it my thinking is a shift in monetary policy if you look at the assets of the Federal Reserve you will in fact see that it was when the FED shifted from quantitative tightening where they were reducing the size of their balance sheet to quantitative easing that is precisely where Ada a Bitcoin found the bottom you can see it pretty clearly it had nothing to do with all the narratives that people are arguing about on X or on YouTube nothing to do with any of that stuff it was just hey Ada to bitcoin goes down during QT and adaa Bitcoin goes up during QE and once again we find ourselves in a situation where we are in QT and guess what eight of bitcoin's going down and there were a lot of people last summer you know back over here in in in 2023 that were very adamant that ADA to bitcoin was going to be up only from that point because the summer of 2020 or the summer of 2019 is when adaa Bitcoin bottomed last cycle therefore once you got to the having year right the general speculation was that it would only go up it only go back up and why is that why is that speculation so convincing for a lot of people it's because they say that altcoins outperform Bitcoin in a bull run that's the prevailing narrative right that altcoins outperform Bitcoin in a bull run I've been fairly clear that that is not universally true under all market conditions it's not how many times have you heard people say well eth Bitcoin is holding up pretty well compared to last cycle or eth will outperform Bitcoin in the bull market just you wait right but guess guess what despite all of it it's still down against Bitcoin 44% that's not holding up well that's people saying it's holding up well as it just keeps on bleeding right so when did eth Bitcoin bottom last cycle was it the prevailing narrative was it what someone said on on Twitter or what someone said on YouTube or did it bottom when the FED shifted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing if you think that I am cherry-picking cardono and ethereum to support this narrative which is a fair accusation so let me explain myself if you were to look at all Bitcoin pairs this is total 3 minus usct divided by Bitcoin you will find that the collective altcoin Market also bottomed when we shifted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing we only took out that low a couple of you know a couple of times later just on major parabolic rallies by Bitcoin but you can clearly see that ADA fell in the same basket as the General altcoin market it bottomed when we went from when the FED went from reducing their balance sheet to increasing it and it wasn't and it never had to be any more complicated than that and so I've spent a lot of time trying to convince people of this with ethereum with really not a lot of luck and I've I've tried the same thing with a lot of altcoins and I again very mixed amount of luck and the reason has has been and and continues to be that they they say that well it'll it'll outform Bitcoin in a bull market but there's two types of bull markets is I I think what a lot of people are missing there are QE markets and there are qtb markets in a q QT bull market if you look at Ada Bitcoin in a qt bull market for Bitcoin USD let me pull up Bitcoin USD on this chart and we we will try to make it so it's a little bit easier to read here so let me switch this to a log scale so you can see that in a this is 2019 over here right when when Bitcoin was going up over here during QT Ada Bitcoin went down when Bitcoin was going up over here during QE right during QE Ada to bitcoin was going up here Bitcoin USD found this low in November it's been going up Ada of Bitcoin has not been going up like it did over here in 2020 and 2021 right it's been going down since then the reason is because we're still in QT we have not yet gone back to QE so again like it it's this it's making a lot of people really frustrated I mean a lot of people are at each other's throats my only hope back in early 2022 my my goal was to try to prevent people from experiencing this pain that they're experiencing now with these altcoins that just keep seeming like they're bleeding gets Bitcoin and they just won't stop and Bitcoin goes up and the altcoin doesn't go up as much and then Bitcoin corrects and then the altcoin corrects more right I experienced that last cycle and my goal was to try to help people avoid that and instead I think what happens I just pissed a lot of people off right but that was my experience so where is adaa Bitcoin today right where is it today well it's at about 800 31 set so you know all of my views over the last 2 and a half years at this point in time for adaa Bitcoin I would argue have been correct that's not necessarily true though for Ada USD and I will talk about that in a little bit adaab Bitcoin as of right this minute is basically about as low as it's been with exception of this Wick over here it's about as low as it's been for this entire you know this entire mve down right the point of all of that was to say look guys I know you like cardano I know you like Ada but during QT you're probably going to be better off with Bitcoin it's nothing personal against cardano there nothing personal it's just this is the reality of the situation and this was the reality of the situation in 2019 that I refused to accept I didn't I don't want to accept it right and so what I did was I you know I I bought Ada throughout this entire phase and at one point at you know eventually the FED pivoted ate a Bitcoin bottomed and I was just like well hell I could have just stuck with Bitcoin during that entire time taken on a lot less risk and gotten a lot more reward because after all this time a to bitcoin dropped 95% even during a Bitcoin bull market now we didn't put in new Highs but we still had a Bitcoin bull market so how is this time different well look this trend line here that I know a lot of a lot of my biggest critics have been sort of focused on it looks like it's breaking right I have been fairly clear that I think that it will break right what would cause Ada Bitcoin to bottom out here right I'm having a you know I'm trying to have like a discussion in my mind of like what would actually cause it the bottom out here the only thing that I could think of would be that if something catastrophic happens and the FED pivots a lot sooner than anyone's expecting one other thing we we we talked about how Ada Bitcoin bottomed you know when basically when the the the fed pivoted from QT to QE right so let me let me overlay this on the chart so we can see that it also though bottomed after the FED cut rates as well so if you were to Overlay us interest rates onto this chart you can pretty clearly see that adaa Bitcoin did not bottom until after the FED cut rates now this cycle the FED has not yet cut rates and they also have not shifted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing so my Buy is still that ADA a Bitcoin will bleed with that said that doesn't mean that it goes down in a straight line although for the last couple of months it really has done that so I making this video right now knowing that there is a possibility that it could bounce off of the range low if it does I just think it will be a temporary bounce kind of like maybe this one over here right you can see that it came back down it got a little bit of a bounce and then ultimately bled much slower with that said I'm still not even convinced we're going to get that bounce considering that we've already you know we already spent a lot of time trying to hold right here at 1100 SATs and we're unable to do so which was basically the same area that it tried to hold over here so this is the issue for Ada Bitcoin this is the issue for Ada what happens if it goes below this level right what happens if it goes below this level well we can look at case studies and I I mean I can walk you through what has historically happened on various alt Bitcoin pairs or various alt USD pairs once their Bitcoin valuations break below key support levels but and maybe I should do that but this is the level to watch 800 sets all right my bias is to think that it will go below 800 sets that's my bias I've been pretty clear about that for the last two years it's been a long journey here we've come down to it a couple of times we've bounced off of it a couple of times we're now down here a third time that is my bias is that we will break below it however I could understand why someone might be more optimistic they might say well what if what if this is like this down here you know what if you know in terms of where we are in this cycle you know this is the having year and this in the having year over here you can see that ADA Bitcoin was putting in supports that It ultimately built off of so I'm not blind to that I mean I can see that that occurred however this also bottomed out after the FED cut rates and once loer monetary policy arrived which still has not yet happened so that's why I'm not yet convinced of that and one great example that many examples you can look at is there's so many other altcoins that are already breaking support so why should a to be any different right madic Bitcoin has broken support pretty clearly right it broke support and you know it broke support the week of March 11th and it's and ever since it broke I mean look how long it took to break support a weekly close below the range low it finally got that Weekly close below the range low the week of March 11th and ever since then it just keeps on going down this is I I remember this pattern this was exactly what Ada Bitcoin did over here after it broke this range low look what adaa Bitcoin did right it finally got a weekly close below it and then it just went down for like two months straight and then it finally bottomed out and then it slowly trended back up so you can see that this is already happening with some alts they're breaking support now madic Bitcoin broke support the week of March 11th what has madic USD done since the week of March 11th because everyone the Bitcoin valuation is what is the only thing that matters but for some reason you guys care more about the USD valuation but ever since March 11th madic USD has gone down right so when alts breaks support against Bitcoin then they usually start to bleed on their USD pairs so that's why this 800 sat level is a very important level for cardano if it [Music] holds then perhaps it doesn't have to meet the Fate that I've outlined of just sort of bleeding back down to the range lows however my bias will be and it will continue to be and it has been for the last two years that as long as the FED has not pivoted I think the bias remains down for all Bitcoin pairs collectively although we can always identify a few that are going against that Trend that is my view right so even if there is a bounce right even if AA does bounce against Bitcoin here and let's say goes back all the way up to 11 or 12200 sets I'm sure I would get a lot of snarky comments right but my view would not change like I would still think it's still going to inevitably roll over over and break now what would change my mind well if at a Bitcoin let's say we're some time off in the future 6 months from now or something if it's still holding above 800 SATs and you know and and we're we're away from QT and we're back in QE then I will\n",

      "AA does bounce against Bitcoin here and let's say goes back all the way up to 11 or 12200 sets I'm sure I would get a lot of snarky comments right but my view would not change like I would still think it's still going to inevitably roll over over and break now what would change my mind well if at a Bitcoin let's say we're some time off in the future 6 months from now or something if it's still holding above 800 SATs and you know and and we're we're away from QT and we're back in QE then I will think that you know I I might change my mind right but that hasn't happened yet right so how can I how can I be compelled to change my mind nothing I have said about a to Bitcoin has been wrong I mean it again it's just been bleeding for a long time now one thing that I was looking at with you know sort of a to bitcoin is as I've said before altcoins are oscillators at best right it's a tail OFA time so if it's an oscillator at best then you have somewhat of a well- defined range here okay and so if it is an oscillator which again is an if it's already down 87% right it's already down 87% if it were to go to the bottom of this range that's another 50% drop by Ada of Bitcoin okay that might sound like a lot but you know over here it dropped 95% um even if it did drop from there down to here that would still be diminishing losses if it were to bottom out at 400 SATs the reason why I was never convinced and I'm still not I I don't think that this trend line will hold and it still looks like it's it's looks like it's breaking it now but again horizontal support lines are more important than diagonals so I don't think that you should put a lot of faith in this diagonal trend line I never have I'm just saying other people that view these videos have sort of said well why does he draw draw the trend line and then say it's not going to hold the reason I said that was because if you look at a to e it it didn't hold the trend line right I mean you could draw similar trend lines for a to eth right and you know bounced off of it but eventually it fell below it and a while back I did a video on cardono where I talked about um if I can find this uh parallel Channel where we talked about ADA eth and basically said that let me switch this to it's already on AOG scale hold on um but basically what I said was that you know a lot of these a lot of these alt coins they they essentially are are oscillators right at best right and I don't know I don't know exactly how to you know you could connect the dots like this and kind if you just ignore this Wick then you can connect the dots like this and say you know you have this low this low this low and then you have this High you have a high here you have a high here but it's still a fairly convincing down downtrend channel right don't get mad at me right take it out with the data I don't control what's happening I'm just telling you this is what's happening back over here in the summer of 2023 I have a video on cardano and I said in that video that I thought the most likely outcome in the short term was for it to go back up here on its ether pair to tag this trend line before rate Cuts arrive why did I say that back then because if you look at interest rates you can see that well that's exactly what it did last cycle was it went back up to sort of the mid part of this trend line tagged it before rate Cuts arrived but it fell off before those rate Cuts arrived right same thing is happening here right it tagged this trend line sort of the mid part of the channel rate Cuts haven't arrived yet Right In fact when it tagged the trend line or sorry when it tagged that that trend line it was about halfway through the PS this trend line was tagged basically back in December so perhaps that indicates we are getting close to rate Cuts in the next few months now I know what you're thinking you're like well Ben you're wrong because the Market's saying rate Cuts aren't coming till September and the market could be right or like they have been for a long time the market could be wrong where they're constantly pricing in stuff based on the most recent data but they're ignoring ing the things that matter more right I mean inflation yes it was a hot print but that can change right easily in a couple of months and and and rate Cuts could get priced back in I have said many many times that the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to be priced back in earlier this year the market was expecting six rate Cuts now they're only expecting two this year so how can we put that much faith in what the market thinks if they've gone from six cuts to two cuts in four months in three and a half months you can't put a lot of weight into this stuff because that from six cuts to two cuts but here's the issue as rate Cuts get priced out it causes companies to throw in the towel because they're like they're they're trying to survive until rate Cuts arrive until looser monetary policy arrives hopefully that increases Demand right we're trying to survive as they keep getting pushed further and further out more and more companies give up you don't believe me you know you can see it pretty clearly right if you go look at at at us um if we just go look at at at bankruptcies in the United States right if you go look at bankruptcies it's still relatively low right I'm not trying to raise the alarm but it's trending up it's trending up pretty clearly the green line is uh this is interest rates and the white line is um bankruptcies this is three months but this these are are bankrupt ancies and it's there's a lag on it right I mean it only shows it through October it only shows it through Q4 of last year but we should get a new data point soon um but bankruptcies are going up right and you can see that interest rates go up bankruptcies go up so the same thing applies over to crypto as looser monetary policy gets pushed further and further out higher risk assets bleed to lower risk assets and that's why bleeds to bitcoin that's why eth bleeds to bitcoin that's why pocot bleeds to bitcoin that's why madic bleeds to bitcoin right link bleeds to bitcoin Litecoin bleeds to bitcoin right it's nothing personal it's just this is what happens during titer monetary policy and you can accept it or you can pretend like it doesn't happen you can of course cherry pick altcoin new altcoins that are smaller market caps and say you're wrong I'm wrong whatever but this is the general Trend and you don't have to look any further than all Bitcoin Pairs and my concern is that the pricing out of these rate Cuts we're now from six rate cuts to two what if that's what it's t what it takes to finally make all Bitcoin pairs breakdown what's fascinating is that last cycle once the range low was set on Alt coins against their Bitcoin pairs it took 41 weeks for them to break down from this low here we're currently at 41 weeks now I don't know if they're going to break down this week or not I think there could be a case to be made for next week during the having as well but you can see that in a lot of ways this time is not different it's taking about the same amount of time as it took last cycle it's just that we reached this point here about three4 later than last cycle and so we still inevitably at some point have to face the rate cut part of the cycle and the rate cut part of the cycle generally comes right after the breakdown and by generally I mean based on the one data point that we have after the breakdown of all Bitcoin pairs if I'm wrong look to this chart to prove it look to see if Ada if all Bitcoin pairs can hold above 04 or in Ada's case if it can hold above 800 sets I don't think it will but if I'm wrong this is where I would be wrong at it would be at this level it would be at 800 sets because if it goes below 800 madx shows you what happens when it breaks support it's not pretty it just starts to bleed so if I'm wrong about adaa Bitcoin from this point I would say I've been right about it for the last two years but sometimes I I ride the trend a bit too long if I'm wrong about it this is where I would be wrong about it because if it goes below here I think it's going to 400 stats that's my that's my view and it's been my view for forever so this is where it needs to hold if I I I'm going to be at all compelled to change my view I think it's going to break prove me wrong and and and we'll see but that is my view and I I'll keep a close eye on it um you know I don't know if it's going to get a little bounce like this or not but it is getting dangerously close and the reason why this is an issue is because the having is next week and if Bitcoin rallies into the having if Bitcoin rallies into the having just like it rallied into the spot ETF and Ada Bitcoin is already on a very precarious level if it can't keep up during that rally then adaa Bitcoin could be broken off support and then when Bitcoin stalls out sometime later after the having you can see here after the ETF it it sted out and went down that's when you could see adaa Bitcoin it's already lost support during a Bitcoin rally and then when Bitcoin gets a correction it no longer has that support level to hold on to and then you you end up getting something like what's happening with with madic Bitcoin and it's not just madic right I mean it's you know you can look at a Bitcoin I mean it just keeps on breaking support after support Litecoin Bitcoin I mean that bleeding against Bitcoin is what Litecoin does best you know so it's a very it's very precarious situation one of the one of the ways I think that might be helpful about to understand Satoshi valuations because I think a lot of people really struggle with thinking about things like it's kind of abstract like oh 800 SATs 400 SATs 1600 SATs like what does that even mean really for a lot of people a lot of people don't really know it's not like tangible to them right but there's a way that I think you can make it more tangible and that's to take the inverse so you go up here and you take 1 / a to bitcoin okay now when you do this you can pretty clearly see a nice compelling Trend and that is look at this or a a way that's not so abstract right now one Bitcoin will get you 120,000 Ada in August 2021 one Bitcoin got you 16,000 Ada in early 2022 I was very clear that altcoins were too risky and they were going to bleed a Bitcoin until dominance hit 60% right that was back when Ada Bitcoin was at or sorry the inverse one Bitcoin would fetch you about 35,000 Ada right so I didn't pivot on it at the actual at that level it was more so q1 2022 where I finally was like all right all Bitcoin pairs are going to bleed the back then one Bitcoin would get you about 38,000 Ada today it gets you 120,000 Ada look at this trend here this is what I this is the Trap that I fell for last cycle do you see this we came up to this level and got rejected by it came all the way back down here we didn't even make it down there yet um in this cycle we you can see it wasn't even as big of a drop here and then after dropping right after dropping we then came up and then broke through it so we we essentially went from one Bitcoin getting you 11,000 Ada here if we get a um a price label to giving you 11,000 Ada there to giving you 250,000 Ada up there here it gave you 16,000 Ada right now it's at 120 you know about 120,000 or so okay so if I'm wrong about ADA a Bitcoin it has to be at this point in my view otherwise if it breaks Above This this it's just going to go to the Range High right I mean there's just not I I just don't think there would be a lot of standing in its way just like over here there wasn't a lot standing in its way once it broke through and it's been you know it's been at this level for a while and and that's my concern is that it's going to break through and come up to this level right so that's I think something that is is worthwhile to consider now what where I have I not been as correct about cardono because that that's something that I I think it's easy for a lot of people to sort of highlight what they've been right about and sort of brush under the rug things they've been wrong about because it's not cool to sort of highlight that you want to be known for only making correct calls and and for having a crystal ball but you know I have news I don't have a crystal ball and I get a lot of things wrong and the only thing you know with 80usd is that back over here in 2023 I did think it was going to go lower than than where it went 23 23 cents I'm not going to try to hide and pretend like I didn't think that I did my understanding was you know thinking that Bitcoin would get a larger a larger correction at the time and I was wrong but I think that the thing to consider here is that ADA USD went up but not because of anything great going on in the altcoin market it just went up because Bitcoin went up because while Ada USD did technically go up a a Bitcoin got a little bit of a bump right but then it's just right back down right it's just right back down and 80usd is probably the most puzzling thing for cardono you know I I I feel very convinced about where its Bitcoin valuation is going I feel very convinced about where it's like eth valuation is going like and and let me I don't think I actually expressed that so let me express it really quick for for the eth valuation my general thought is that you know it probably does something like this where it it you know comes back down and then maybe over here gets a move back up it's kind of my view on a to eth something like that probably so I feel very you know strong about a to bitcoin um or this is inverse of a to bitcoin feel very strong about a to bitcoin a to eth a to USD is is a bit more puzzling because it it it's going to depend on bitcoin right I mean it's it's just going to come down to that and if Bitcoin goes up it can lift Ada with it right just like it did here right I mean just like it did here bit Bitcoin went up and it took a with it so if Bitcoin goes up I mean it can take cardono with it if Bitcoin goes down it's going to take cardano in that direction so Ada USD comes down to what Bitcoin USD does my argument is that ADA to bitcoin and AD to eth doesn't come down to that and and that's why the bit understanding Bitcoin dominance has been so useful because for the last two years if you agreed with me that dominance was going to go up then there really wasn't a compelling case to be super heavy into Ada and I mean you can say whatever you want to but the reality of ADA Bitcoin is you know it's now down 86% 87% from the highs right and even from when I was very vocal about it in in 2022 early 2022 right it's still down like 68% um since that time um so yeah sorry I heard a noise um maybe it's the uh car people but um so that that is at least something that I've spent a lot of time like sort of thinking about um trying to wrap my head around like what is AD USD going to do it's really hard to know it's going to be based on what Bitcoin does and my thought on bitcoin is take a look at this you know we saw Bitcoin USD rally into the spot ETF remember and actually about one week before the spot ETF Bitcoin USD swept the high we're almost at a week before the having if Bitcoin look at this diagonal that that Bitcoin USD was sort of holding it's kind of doing the same thing here right holding a diagonal as it goes into a major event this was the spot ETF so if Bitcoin gets this move into the having and let's say after that it gets a pullback to sort of sweep that low let's say I again I don't know I don't know what it's going to do I've absolutely no idea I'm just saying like you know if it does do something like this um whether this holds or not in my opinion is going to be dependent on if all Bitcoin pairs have collectively broken down so if all Bitcoin pairs have broken down below 04 then I think there's a decent chance Bitcoin could get a larger correction if you look at 2019 during quantitative tightening and high rates the larger correction occurred you know all these Corrections that it previously had were only like 10 15% drops it finally had a larger drop but when that larger drop occurred it didn't occur until after all Bitcoin pairs broke down the week of June 24th that's what marked the local top for Bitcoin was the week of June 24th so if the same thing happens I think you have to keep an eye on all Bitcoin pairs look at look at it like this if you look at Bitcoin USD overlaid onto this chart you will see right here when all Bitcoin pairs broke down that's where Bitcoin USG found a local top so they haven't broken down yet and we still have the having coming up but if they do break down into the having you have to wonder will that Mark a at least a local top if you think about it Bitcoin had a local top in um in April of last year before it had about a you know a two-month drop or so look at this the week of April 10th local top for a while look at 2021 the week of April 12th right so you have the week of April 12th the week of April 10th guess what 2013 the week of or sorry that's 2011 here's 2013 the week of April 8th April is an important time for Bitcoin right and so a lot of times you do see pullbacks into May um just like we had here just like we had here and just like we had over here so if Bitcoin rallies into the having and it breaks Ada Bitcoin off support off of 800 stats and if at that point Bitcoin USD rolls over into May and gets a correction and Ada Bitcoin is already below support then it could do something like what madic Bitcoin is doing where it breaks support and then after it breaks support then the USD valuation starts to bleed back down that is something that I you know I spent a lot of time looking at are the are the Bitcoin valuations if on the other hand Bitcoin does not get a correction after the having and keeps going up then ad USD could go up with it right my only point is that in either case if you think if you agree with my view right there's if Ada Bitcoin goes down no matter what then I've been under the under the opinion that just be Bitcoin heavy until looser monetary policy arrives and then you know sometime after that not immediately because even when it when it arrives it's probably arriving for the wrong reason but that's been my view right exposure to crypto I think especially with a larger market cap alts you're better off with Bitcoin because it it just it's outperforming Bitcoin dominance is going up and yes yes I was wrong about ausd right here I hold my hand up high right I was wrong about it but I will say I think the you know the reason it's gone up up and again this is me rationalizing right is because Bitcoin went up it's not because of any any other reason and so you know if Bitcoin keeps going up it can take Ada with it but you still would have just been better off with Bitcoin as Ada Bitcoin bleeds what you look for for this trend to change is looser monetary policy to arrive so until looser monetary policy arrives why would I change my bias so that's my view if you look at ad USD without any of the monetary policy stuff or the um the Bitcoin valuation stuff I can certainly see how you would come to a completely different conclusion and I don't think it's fair to completely discount that view if you look at this at the Cycles here you can see that ADA USD had this bare Market it then went up back down and then back up came down and then if you ignore the pandemic right it just came came up here and then fell back into the bull market support band before slowly grinding higher and then going up a lot right so look at it like this this is down down right up down up up down up back down to the range low back down to the range low ignore the ignore the pandemic right just pretend like it didn't happen you go up and then you go back to the bullmark export band right you go up and then you go back to the bullmark sport band right which kind\n",

      "The transcript presents a detailed analysis of the Cardano (ADA) cryptocurrency and its performance relative to Bitcoin. The speaker expresses a bearish sentiment, arguing that altcoins like ADA will continue to bleed against Bitcoin during periods of quantitative tightening (QT) by the Federal Reserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key points made in the transcript are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The speaker's bias has been that altcoins will bleed against Bitcoin since 2022, and this view has been playing out, with larger altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano testing support against Bitcoin. The speaker believes that the primary driver of altcoin performance is the monetary policy environment, with altcoins tending to outperform Bitcoin during periods of quantitative easing (QE) and underperforming during QT.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The speaker provides historical examples, showing that Cardano's bottom against Bitcoin in the previous cycle coincided with the Fed's pivot from QT to QE, and not any specific Cardano-related developments. Currently, the speaker believes Cardano is approaching a crucial support level of 800 sats against Bitcoin, and their base case is that it will break below this level, as the Fed remains in a QT environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The speaker acknowledges the possibility of a temporary bounce in Cardano's price against Bitcoin, but maintains that the overall trend will be downward for Cardano against Bitcoin, unless the Fed pivots back to QE. The speaker provides historical examples of altcoin performance during periods of QT, showing that altcoins tend to bleed against Bitcoin as higher-risk assets are sold off in favor of the lower-risk Bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The speaker also discusses the potential impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, noting that if Cardano's price against Bitcoin is unable to keep up with a potential Bitcoin rally leading up to the halving, it could lead to a breakdown in Cardano's support against Bitcoin, which could then result in further losses when Bitcoin eventually corrects.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The speaker acknowledges that Cardano's USD valuation is more puzzling, as it will depend on the overall performance of Bitcoin. The speaker suggests that if Bitcoin rallies, it could lift Cardano's USD price, but maintains that exposure to Bitcoin may be a better strategy than holding Cardano directly, given the altcoin's tendency to bleed against Bitcoin during periods of QT.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the transcript presents a comprehensive and data-driven bearish outlook on Cardano's performance against Bitcoin, primarily driven by the speaker's belief that altcoins will continue to bleed during the current QT environment, rather than any specific factors related to Cardano.\n",

      "the pandemic right it just came came up here and then fell back into the bull market support band before slowly grinding higher and then going up a lot right so look at it like this this is down down right up down up up down up back down to the range low back down to the range low ignore the ignore the pandemic right just pretend like it didn't happen you go up and then you go back to the bullmark export band right you go up and then you go back to the bullmark sport band right which kind of already did we bounced off of it and now we're back to it right so if you were only looking at this I completely get that view right and that's why I've said I'm more puzzled by Ada USD than Ada Bitcoin or Ada eth my view is that if 0usd goes up it's only because bitcoin's going up a lot more right if Bitcoin goes to 80k it can take the altcoin market with it but it's still probably going to outperform the altcoin market so you could get a situation where Ada a Bitcoin breaks down but Ada USD is is is not breaking down in the same way my base case is that ADA Bitcoin breaks down and that ADA USD sort of sees a a a a pullback you know a substantial pullback but this is also a potential outcome and the reason why I have to highlight that is I was wrong about 8usd here right here so I could be wrong you know maybe I'm maybe my view is not is is is not worthwhile to consider right here honestly on ad USD I think I have a better grip on its Bitcoin valuation and it's eth valuation and the reason is because I think that no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD a to bitcoin goes down until looser monetary policy arrives no matter the direction of eth USD I think a to eth goes down until loose monetary policy arrives but ad USD does depend on the direction of Bitcoin USD whereas I don't think Ada Bitcoin does so Ada USD is is much more difficult to forecast in my opinion than Ada a Bitcoin if adaa Bitcoin breaks support then I do think ad USD will drop just like madic Bitcoin broke support madic USD is dropping just like last cycle we saw altcoins break support against Bitcoin and then alt USD Val valuations dropped for a while this trend here will be dependent on does it hold at this bull market support band like it did in 2020 does it hold there or does it not you know and I don't know you could argue that this phase right here is like that phase or you could argue that this phase here is like this phase in fact it looks more like that phase if you were to take a bar pattern right if you uh just line this up here right if you look at that and you put it right here like this to me still looks looks more like this than it does this little one over here and what's interesting is if you overlay us interest rates onto this chart you will see that this pattern here emerged right before rate Cuts arrived what if this pattern here is emerging right before rate Cuts arrive and so as all Bitcoin pairs break down and all USD evaluations roll over that represents the consumer finally becoming weak and then the FED Cuts rates and then they shift from QT to QE all Bitcoin pairs bottom just at the last minute where I finally convince everyone the Bitcoin dominance is going to go up but by the by the time the last person believes in the Bitcoin dominance rally that's when the dominance rally is over I don't think the dominance rally is over yet if you look at Bitcoin dominance it's been slowly building up to the range highs there's been a lot of people that have have completely ignored dominance for years right they cherry-pick micro cap alts to say why dominance doesn't matter they say well eth is holding up well against Bitcoin down 40% is not holding up well you know if you look at at at quarterly returns for you know for asset pairs like eth Bitcoin this is now the six quarter in a row where it's potentially red now we still have a long time to go in this quarter so we don't know but let's take a look at the same thing for Ada Bitcoin look at adaa Bitcoin look at this 2022 adaa Bitcoin was entirely red 2023 it was read three or four quarters and so far this year it's only red there's been one quarter and look at this even the Q4 2021 was read right so you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 out of the last well I guess I mean if you if you just take it from here right so this is 4 8 10 11 if you include this one so out of the last if this is also assuming this current quarter stays red out of the last 11 quarters Ada Bitcoin has been green one quarter right one quarter out of the last 11 by the time I convince the last person the downtrend could be over you know we're probably not that far away because I think that rate cuts and shifts in monetary policy are going to occur this year this is what I was trying to help people avoid but as I said earlier I I think instead of helping people avoid it I hope some people did I think I just made a lot of enemies so next cycle I can practically guarantee you that I'm not going to be going on this you know mission to convince everyone of these altcoins bleeding against Bitcoin during QT because it doesn't get you anywhere right it just makes people M mad at you and if and if the asset goes up on its USD pair they never forgive you even if even if it's bleeding on his Bitcoin pair because people only care about for whatever reason they only care about USD valuations if you look at a to USD you go to assets here and you look at at at just cardano doesn't look as bad right I mean there's still a lot of but there's also some green right you know there was a 62% move in 2023 right there early 2023 and in Q4 133% move q1 9% Q2 negative 9% so like it doesn't look as bad on its USD valuation but let's suppose you carried out a a um a DCA strategy where ever since the beginning of 2022 to the current day you bought $100 worth of bitcoin and you bought it weekly on Monday you would have put in $11,900 your current portfolio valuation would be worth 30.5k let's say you did the same thing for Ada so you'd be up 156% had you done DCA strategy for Bitcoin really since the bare Market began in early 2022 if you did the same thing for Ada you'd only be up 46% so anyone who followed a DCA strategy for Ada can still feel good at the current time on its USD valuation because it's still up 46% and you can be mad at me for being like well you said it was going to go down but the the reality is that you still would have been better off with Bitcoin by a lot and you would have taken on less risk and you would have had more reward this won't go on you know forever there will be a time where adaa Bitcoin gets a more sustained bounce I just don't think it occurs until looser monetary policy arrives that's my view I'm not going to apologize for it I'm going to stick through it this cycle but next cycle I'm done with it I'm not I'm not I'm it's not my mission anymore after this um but that's something to consider now if we go back over here to the asset filter for cardano we can look at a few things we talk about Bitcoin dominance a lot look at Ada dominance where is it right now it's at 7 n5% adaa dominance this past cycle on The Daily actually went higher than it was last cycle that's not something you see a lot of altcoins do it does happen sometimes it's not something you see frequently where did it bottom last cycle it bottomed at a dominance of between 0.5 to 6 it's currently at you know just around 08 so I'm arguing that you know maybe it needs to come down here to 0.5 to 6 if you look at the risk on cardano where is the risk right now 0 463 that's the current risk on Ada 0463 again if you bought here you're doing quite well right now still would have been better off with Bitcoin at some point that changes in terms of a short-term move but when it changes that Trend likely only lasts a year if you look at Ada a Bitcoin what do you notice yes it was slowly trending up over here but the big move it doesn't even last a year right I mean it just lasts a few months right these moves last a few months and then everyone spends years dreaming about them again right they only last a few months so the reality with altcoins is that they bleed against Bitcoin for most of the cycle they get a rapid move up at some point and then everyone spends the next three half years wishing for it again they wish for alt season and while they keep wishing for alt season Bitcoin dominance goes up so no just something something to think about going back to some of the charts let's see what the long-term holders are doing for ad so I mean it looks like it went down a little bit it's not as I mean you know Bitcoin long-term hold I mean it's gone down from 55% down to 48% so if you were to look at at short-term holder hotle waves you can see there's been a little bit of an uptick recently as the price of ADA went up if we were to look at I don't know what do you guys want to look at as if you can respond right now um here's the mvrv zcore for Ada still pretty low look at it for for Bitcoin it's been doing a lot better the issue is you can see last cycle going into rate Cuts Bitcoin also saw the nbrb score go around these levels um and you can see that in 2019 Ada didn't go nearly as high as Bitcoin did on its nbz score in that 2019 move compared to like what it eventually did later once QB returned once Lo monetary policy arrived um not really sure what else there is to talk about with it I mean you guys generally Know My Views at this point here's a draw down from the all-time high on its USD valuation here it is on its Bitcoin valuation right we spent a long time down here right you can even see at one point there was a little divot back up and then it came back down kind of like this right a little divot back up and then it just came back down let's take a look at the days since percentage decline how long has it been since Ada had a 30% drop it's been about 215 days the record is about 253 days or so maybe a little bit more 257 days is the record we're currently at 215 days right so again I mean like it's due at some point for a correction um maybe sometime after the having for Bitcoin there are some other charts that you can look at that are a little bit more optimistic I think some of them are like Roi after the low could be one well I don't know I mean if you look at this one compared to last cycle you know I mean we could just be in a phase where we just sort of slowly bleed a little bit and get one more pop up maybe on a Bitcoin rally and then it and then it just Fades you look at it on Roi after cycle Peak out to the next Peak look at this look how look how close this looks the funny thing is if it were to go down to the last cycle where the last cycle was it would actually put it at the range lows right at the range you know at its prior range lows if it were to just simply go back down to where it was last cycle at this time and you can see that it was after the Peak at this time where it did slowly roll over for a few weeks right so you could get a scenario where it just simply drops back down and still doing what it did last cycle um I don't know if that always I mean does let's see does every cycle here's Litecoin I mean so you can see not every cycle always stays above the prior cycle right so here is you know this is cycle the Blue Line cycle one and then the orange line is cycle two you can see that it did come down and and tag the prior cycle sum then if you compare two to three you can see that three has below to right so that's why you know you can't look at at at this and then you know unilaterally declare that it can't go back down to where the prior cycle was you can see with other coins that it does sometimes happen and I imagine xrp is another example right yeah where it sometimes happens um the first cycle you know compared so the first cycle was the Blue Line the second cycle was this orange line so secondy cycle was worse in fact and then second cycle to third cycle you can say that this cycle for XR P has been a little bit better um than the last cycle as measured from Peak to Peak so I mean I guess I guess my general view on cardano is that I I assume that ADA to bitcoin will bleed I assume that ADA to eth will bleed until loose monetary policy arrives Ada USD I think it's just going to be dependent on what Bitcoin USD does and because I don't know what Bitcoin USD is going to do um because I can't predict you know what these short-term moves are going to do I would still argue that Bitcoin Dominus is going to go up you're better off with Bitcoin then a lot of these altcoins and then after L Luci monetary policy arrives I will I will change my view I don't apologize for it it has not been wrong to be bearish on adaa bitcoin for the last two and a half years there's narratives there's stories about what's causing it to go down all sorts of stories and then you can simply go look at monetary policy and see what actually caused it a turnaround last cycle was going from QT to QE QT no QE yet so I'm not going to change my view prove me wrong by holding 800 SATs as support if it goes below 800 SATs I think 400 SATs is next support where does 400 SATs put it well it depends on what the price of of of Bitcoin is you know here's this wolf frame Alpha so at at at 830 SATs at a 70 what is what is bitcoin right now bitcoin's basically at 71k right so at 71k that puts Ada at you know 59 cents right which is exactly where it is you can see Ada USD is at R around 59 cents at 75,000 Bitcoin 830 sets puts Ada USD at 62 cents right so you can see that if Ada Bitcoin holds support Bitcoin USD could go up and Ada USD could go up with it even though Ada Bitcoin hasn't gone up but what happens if Ada a Bitcoin break support and goes to say 600 STS right let's say it goes to 600 STS and bitcoin's at 75k then you have an ADA that's at 45 cents what happens if Bitcoin gets a large correction back down to 40K and adaa Bitcoin is at 600 CS right then it's back to 24 cents which is back down to the range lows right so you can kind of see I mean 0usd is going to be completely dependent on on bitcoin completely dependent on bitcoin I think Ada Bitcoin and Ada eth are not dependent on bitcoin USD which finalizes the discussion for today for me with Carano and what I've said is that Bitcoin gives you exposure to the upside during quantitative tightening and high rates while also minimizing your downside risk you can get out of me for being bearish on Ada of Bitcoin for the last two and a half years or you can accept the fact that 10 out of last 10 of the last 11 quarters have been R for Ada a Bitcoin and by the time the last person is convinced will probably be right around the time that rate Cuts arrive and that's probably when the market Trend shifts and we go back the other way and I just want people to understand my views why I think that what I've been right about what I've been wrong about not try to hide behind it I'm trying to learn as I go 8usd if you want to be optimistic on it see if it can hold the bullmark sport band that is currently at 56 to 58 cents right so as long as it's holding that you're still there's still a hope right but look if it breaks below like there and gets a weekly close well below it and then just sort of keeps dropping then the trend could last for several more months if you give something like this where it holds as support then maybe there's more upside right it really depends on on what happens here um at this bullmark sport B so keep an eye on the bullmark sport B for Ada USD the 20 week SM the 21 EMA for Ada Bitcoin just keep an eye on on 800 STS below 800 I think it's going to 400 if you want to prove me wrong have it hold 800 thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on in the cryptoverse premium at in

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the hotle waves or hotel waves whichever you prefer so we're putting back on our onchain analysis hat if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse doccom where you can get access to charts like this one not only do we have it for Bitcoin which is what we make most of the videos on but we actually have the same charts for a lot of different cryptocurrencies so make sure you guys check that out links in the description below and that sale is going to end after the having so not too long from now the Huddle waves are only interesting some of the time because most of the time they're not really doing anything that is that interesting what I mean by that we can separate out long-term huddle waves and short-term hudle waves now in this case we're going to Define long-term huddle waves as anything greater than 6 months meaning if someone purchased Bitcoin they put it in their wallet if they've held it for at least 6 months we are saying that belongs in the longterm huddle wave now you might disagree with that and that's fine I'm just providing the definition that I'm using here and if we do that you get something that looks like this now what's fascinating about it is basically without fail when Bitcoin breaches new highs the long-term huddle wave starts to drop like a rock it happened in 2017 you can see 2017 right here Bitcoin breached new highs the long-term hot waves started to drop as long-term holders started to sell to short-term holders right so people who bought Bitcoin back over here started to sell now you might say well if you bought Bitcoin at you know at back over here at $200 and you started selling it when it hit new Highs at say you know just over $1,000 well you missed out on another 20x move but you also have to understand that the people that bought here it's not like they knew exactly how high it was going to go it's all obvious and H sight but at the time they were up five or 6X so a lot of times those long-term holders will start to sell into those parabolic rallies after new all-time Highs are breached in 2019 we did not hit new all-time highs before we had a 9month bare market and you can see the long-term hotle wave didn't really drop that much but in 2020 late 2020 and early 2021 as Bitcoin breached new highs the long-term hotle wave started to really drop and that is where a local top was carved out just like a top was carved out over here in 2017 just like tops were carved out in April of 2013 and November of 2013 and in 2011 all of those saw long-term holders the hotle waves dropping and today once again as Bitcoin breached those new all-time highs if you look closely here that's when the long-term hotle waves started to drop and in fact just in December long-term hotle waves were basically accounting for about n 79% and you can see that ever since then they've been dropping so January 77% February 76% March 74% now we're in April and they're at 71% right so the low in May of 2021 was 58% and the low in January 2018 was 44% right so this was a a low and then a higher low suggesting that we might not even see it go all the way down to 58% and it's already at 71 but it is dropping relatively quickly right you can see that you know March first it was at 75.8 5% now it's April you know in April 1 71.5 56 so it dropped you know about 4% from 75 71 in only a month so it is it has been dropping relatively quickly that doesn't mean you know when it drops it doesn't necessarily have to mean that the top is put in immediately but what it does typically indicate is that Bitcoin is going into some form of a topping pattern where it's either putting in a local top or a market cycle top for instance in 2021 in 2021 it put in a local top in April and then it put in a higher high in November in 2013 put in a local top in April and then it put in a higher high in November right very very similar 2013 and 2021 local high in April higher high in November in 2017 there was no higher high later on and that occurred in January in June there was no or in 2011 there was no higher high later on and that occurred in June so again it I mean it really depends on on what happens with Bitcoin going into the having we've sort of talked about how Bitcoin has been showing a lot of strength over the last few months it rallied into the spot ETF we've seen something very similar going into the having so far I mean we almost just went to the new we almost put in new all-time highs not too long ago so we've actually seen some of that sort of optimism come back for Bitcoin as I'll have to admit again I'll have to say as alt bleed back to the king it's the reality um that's what's happening and I mean you can see very clearly that long-term holders are selling to to short-term holders and again I mean I know I mean we talked about it over here in in um in in the last cycle and I mean it never really elicits super great feelings but just is what it is right I mean you know if you bought at lower prices and and you see Bitcoin hitting new highs people start to take profits that's just what we've always seen and this cycle as you can see is no different right I mean this cycle is very much the same as the cycle before it and the cycle before it and the cycle before that and the cycle before that as you hit new alltime highs long-term holders sell to short-term holders and you can actually visualize that by looking at short-term holder hotle waves as long-term holder hotle waves are going down short-term holder H hotle waves are going up meaning people who have been holding Bitcoin for less than 6 months you can see that at all these major tops the short-term hotle wave goes into its own Peak you can see in 2017 you can see it here in 2021 and once again the short-term holders have come to to form another potentially lower high on the short-term hotle wave so two cycles ago it topped out at 56% or so last cycle it topped out at around 41% right now it's it's currently at about 28.6 n but it is going up relatively quickly um you know December it was at 21 January at 22 February at 23 March 26 April 28 almost 29% so it's it's starting to you know the short-term holders the percentages are starting to accelerate so what's happening is that as Bitcoin is spending these times at these higher prices there has been a rotation from longer term holders to Shorter term holders and again I mean that's just what the data shows or at least what it suggests the long-term holders are going down short-term holders are going up and you can even break it down into you know shorter time frames if you want like you could look at one week to one month uh one day to one week you could even combine less than one day all the way up to one month and see that there has been a little bit of an uptick recently and going all the way out to three months a very similar thing right at all these local tops that's kind of what you see and again that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be immediately but it just means something to be aware of going in the next month or so as we get into the having um and if you were to look at long term let's say like look at one year to twoe um it's actually still dropping right which is funny because that's what it normally does right around the time um that we're at this stage of the cycle right it's dropping into this phase so again you know the Cycles can feel different but at the end of the day um you never know when the parabolic rallies are going to hit but they always end up kind of looking the same and my guess is that when we look back on this phase in a couple of years it will be no different um than every other time the thing that I'd be looking for as I've mentioned a number of times for Bitcoin um you know for a local top to be in I would look to see whenever all Bitcoin pairs break down uh currently they're sitting at about 045 I think at 39 or below that means they've broken down and that's a potential uh sign that you know you could see a a pullback um hasn't happened yet but it could very well happen next week as we go into the having what better time for all Bitcoin pairs to break down than the week of the Bitcoin having uh so we'll see if that in fact happens next week or if we kick the C down the road the market has been pretty good about doing that for a while but just something to think about right as you as you you know tie in the onchain data to what's going on over on you know over with Bitcoin USD and and also you know looking at at some of the things we talked about with Bitcoin USD and and um kind of that pattern that we saw play out going into the spot ETF was that we flirted with those highs for a long time and then as the spot ETF arrived Bitcoin then took out those highs and it even took it out about a week before too but it was not it was really shortlived then it really took it out when the spot ETF arrived and then it had a larger sell off to take out that low over there so if you want to compare the same thing that would be that low right there Bitcoin is kind of doing the same thing right it's slowly grinding up into this big event right just like it slowly went up into this B ETF will something very similar happen the the the having is is not that far away um so if that r is able to to break all Bitcoin pairs down uh then it it could correspond to you know something um a very similar looking long-term holder chart where it it starts to um bottom out and then starts to go back up right because that's normally what happens right after Bitcoin finds a local top long-term holders uh and and as it starts to go back down then the long-term holders um or the short-term holders start to panic cell um and and um and then it just goes back the other way so again could still be a little ways away from that but something to keep in mind as we go into the next month or two um as we go into April April does tend to be a month where Bitcoin um you know there there has been some excitement and and even in 2019 we actually rallied until June which you know happened to be another another year where we eventually had rate cuts um so it might be worth comparing to 2019 as well where it it rallied until it wi even later again I think the answer lies with alts you know alt Bitcoin pairs I think that's kind of where I stand I don't know when they're going to break down but when they do that's what I think marks the turn in the market for now you can see that the long-term hotle waves are playing out like they always do they drop as Bitcoin makes new highs and and we ignore it because it's not it's not a fun sort of thing to to acknowledge um but it is happening once again and we will see if it if it plays out just as it always has and if it does then whenever a local top is in you would expect this to start to go back the other way right so once this goes back the other way that might be indicative of the local top actually being in right now um or at least confirmation it's not going to tell you when the high is in because the high will come before this bottoms theoretically but if it starts to go back up then it might imply that whatever the high is at that point could be the actual local top for at least next few months if not longer but anyways I think we'll go ahead and wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up we're pretty close to 800,000 subscribers so do subscribe to the channel if

      "    [Music] [Music] of approximately 8% now we have followed this for a long time and we've said previously that the general idea is going through undervaluation phases and overvaluation phases now not All undervaluation Phases and overvaluation phases are the same there are more durable periods where we are undervalued and more durable periods where we were overvalued there were there was a period in 2019 where we went over valued for a few months and then came back down to the undervaluation territory until the end of the having Year in 2012 we went overvalued and then we actually came back down until the end or at least until the the beginning of the post having year so currently we are slightly overvalued now when we talk about overvalued that doesn't mean you know that the market has to immediately drop to the fair value as you can see we can spend months if not years in the overvaluation territory so it's important to recognize that you go from undervaluation to overvaluation and the general idea is to scale in at undervaluation and to scale out at overvaluation understanding that undervaluation and overvaluation can take years to ultimately play out now currently we have just gone above the fair value logarithmic aggression trend line last time we did that was late 2020 and you can see that we had a more durable overvaluation period the time before that was just before you know February 2020 we had a a pretty bad crash after that and the time before that was November or sorry April of 2019 where it stayed overvalued uh basically until the end of the year right until about Q4 or so of that year so definitely uh different times um in the cryptoverse will will sort of lead to more dur moves above the overvaluation above the fair value log than the congression trend line and other periods only get you slightly above it either way I think it makes sense to have a plan and I just wanted to sort of present that hey we are now technically overvalued um after being undervalued essentially since um June of 2022 right undervaluation starting June 2022 and now we find ourselves back to being over what's interesting and we talked about this before is that there has been a large rotation of capital um into Bitcoin and a way from the altcoin market alts are still doing okay on their USD pairs but a lot of that Capital has gone into Bitcoin and you can find evidence for that in the in the reality that Bitcoin is currently sitting in new highs uh well it is while I'm making this video maybe by the time that um this video comes out the the price of Bitcoin will be different right now it's at at around 70k 70.5k just sort of pull it up 70.5k U by the time you watch this video of course it it could be different could be lower could be higher I don't know um but while while Bitcoin is at a new high a lot of altcoins are not right and we know that ethereum is not and basically most of the top 10 if not I mean if not basically all of them um I'm not sure if there's one but I mean a lot of them are just not at highs and a lot of them are even nowhere close to being at highs and that's kind of why we focused so much and we continue to focus on on the dominance of Bitcoin and why it makes sense you know through you know during QT and and and rate hikes uh late rate hi late late rate late rate hiking cycle to be heavy Bitcoin as opposed to um heavy eth or something like that and then after rate Cuts occur then some of those higher risk stuff can then start to to catch back up but we haven't reached that stage yet I mean I know it's a long wait and I I know a lot of people keep front running the theoretical offseason that they want but the reality is that you know Bitcoin continues to take more and more market share as the Bitcoin dominance goes higher and as we've gone from being undervalued to being overvalued okay and again sometimes I just look at the chart and just kind of stare at it and say you know what we can over complicate things by looking at the nitty-gritty details and you know we sort of do that we look at what's happening on the lower time frames a lot but at the end of the day you know for everyone sanity just sometimes take a step back and look at the General market trend there are going to be good times in the future there are going to be bad times in the future the General market trend is up over a long enough period of time you can have some pretty scary phases March 2020 basically all of 2022 a lot of 2018 a lot of 2014 right I mean even even in in late 2015 we had another scare right so I mean those phases can of course happen and when they do just remember the General market Trend right go back to that and you know I tried to couple this with sort of dominance and and Bitcoin dominance and then monetary Theory or monetary policy and and and just kind of trying to understand which cryptocurrencies are going to outperform and through a lot of these prior phases right this whole bull market right here in 2019 Bitcoin dominance went up and I went well into overvaluation territory um and guess what during this whole rally Bitcoin dominance has mostly gone up right and again during late rate hiking cycle uh very very familiar in fact so again this is a more General view if you take the percent difference from the market cap and the fair value log the congression trend line you get something looks like this um so you can see we've gone again above the fair value and the last time that occurred U you can see the different times that it occurred and sometimes we go overvalued for a long time and then other times it is much more shorter lived and so you know whether it's going to be shorter lived or not I think will ultimately depend on the reaction of Bitcoin as we go into rate Cuts right there have been a lot of instances where Bitcoin finds a local top in April that doesn't mean that it has to this time time in 2019 in fact it rallied until June right and we know the First Rate cut might not occur until June maybe it'll even get pushed out further than that or maybe it'll be may but a lot of times there's reason to think that the market could cool off and sort of after the having you can see it cooled off after the H or after April in 2013 it cooled off after April in 2021 and even last year you know we did sweep the high in June but it still more or less cooled off with the exception of that one week where we back up it was still a fair fairly boring summer and and not until Q4 arrived did the market get back into gear same thing in 2013 it wasn't until Q4 arrived really that the market really got back into gear so you know whether it is a brief overvaluation period or not I think is going to be dependent on on what Bitcoin does going into those rate Cuts because you know last cycle we saw it we saw Bitcoin Fade Into rate cuts um I mean you can see that fairly clearly right here as the rate Cuts arrived we saw Bitcoin sort of fade into it and if that repeats itself then you could get a shorter period of overvaluation kind of like 2019 or you know late 2011 or even February 2020 and then you go back to being undervalued and then you get done another move later on right we've seen that happen a lot Counterpoint though in 2017 once we went overvalued we didn't really look back for another 6 months so definitely a lot of things to consider but that is you know what the chart looks like right now technically slightly overvalued based on the data that's fit to all data right the the logarithmic regression trend line is fit to all data um so it's not what I think it's just hey this is the fit to all data and currently we are slightly above it business as usual right nothing has changed so those are the general that's the general Trend here of the cryptoverse and of course I mean I've said before I think the ultimate um the ultimate goal is is 10 trillion uh plus or minus a few trillion and as we go to sleep at night we cannot help a wonder what's a few trillion dollars among friends thank you guys for tuning in I'll see you next time bye\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the macroverse today we're going to talk about the most recent jobs report if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptv verse.com let's go ahead and jump in so we had a pretty blowout jobs report today the unemployment rate well stayed relatively flat I mean it's still at 3.7% um if you were to go take a look closely you can see that we popped up here to 3.8% for you know three months and then we dropped down to 3.7 and now we've been at 3.7% for 3 months so the the labor market in that regard Still Remains relatively strong it has not shown the um you know a a move yet above 4% if you were to take a moving average uh like a three-month moving average you can see that it was going up the three-month SME but yet it has pulled back recently to where the 3month SMA is back down to 2 3.7% so pretty good numbers coming from the unemployment rate if you were to look at there and there's some other we we could we could also break it down by category uh we could look at like 16 to 19 year olds and see that it's Fallen a little bit here it had reached a level of 12.4% by October and it's actually Fallen a little bit here going into the latter part of last year and the early part of this year if we were to take a look at what it was doing a year ago you can see let me sort of zoom in over here you can see that for 16 to 19 year olds a year ago it was it actually found sort of a local high in um November of 2022 uh here it found a local high in October of 2023 and of course last year it it essentially and we just got the data point for January so we're essentially looking at at sort of comparing this data point to this one right here right from January 2023 and you can see that um sort of from like a cyclical point of view this this metric trended down until May and then starting in May and then moving you know through October that's when that's when it started to go up so that's an interesting metric I also want to take a look at the unemployment level uh this is something that we got today um we saw 144,000 144,000 to the downside meaning the unemployment level fell and that's of course reflected in in the unemployment rate right I mean you can see that it it was at 6.26 6.27 million and then it dropped all the way down to about 6.12 million if we were to take a 3month moving average of that I mean you can see it it essentially just looks like the like the unemployment rate we could also go take a look at at the unemployment level by reason for unemployment um you have job losers which dropped about 30,000 uh still technically in an uptrend but it has leveled off here recently you could look at Job Lo job losers on temporary layoff also dropped by about 41,000 we could also go look at at new entrance to the labor force this is one of the ones that has been moving up probably the most aggressively for a little while that one dropped off pretty pretty big uh this last month right and if you take a three-month estimate of that one you know and you try to get tune out some of the noise you can see that it has been moving up um from you know the mid 400k range all the way up to the you know near around 600k range so pretty big move in a short period of time but this month it had a fairly substantial drop we can also go take a look at the unemployment rate per state I'm not going to spend a a a lot of time here this was actually updated um about a week ago but just to go through a few States some of them look better than others um and again a lot of them still have relatively low unemployment rates right like the unemployment rate in in Alabama is is 2.6% but if we were to go look at some of the other you know some of the larger states by population right if you were to look at at California the unemployment rate continues to to not do so well it's all the way up at 5.1% % one of the reasons I think is because as we've gotten further and further into the tightening cycle a lot of the tech companies the smaller market cap tech companies you know they just haven't done as well right it's it's certainly easy to look at at companies like apple and and meta and and alphabet and so on and so forth Microsoft and see that they're doing well but they also have a lot of cash on hand they have healthy balance sheets and they're more likely to survive tightening Cycles whereas a lot of the smaller market cap stuff that maybe doesn't have as good healthy of a balance sheet those stuff those places are are are struggling more and of course are laying people off and and that might be one of the reasons why you see places like California uh with an unemployment rate that continues to go up while other places for instance like Connecticut while it has gone up recently I mean it there's no denying that the unemployment rating in Connecticut has started to turn up right I mean it was 3.5 now then 3 6 and then it moved to 3.8 it's still nowhere near California which is at 5.1 and there's some other places I believe up in you know up in New England um I believe like Rhode Island is one that has relatively low unemployment rate again one of these where it's it's moved up recently but in September it was all the way down at 2.6% right I mean you know if you think back to the the national rate was was 3.4 but in Rhode Island it was all the way down here at 2.6 now it has started to move up recently right 2.6 2.7 2.9 3.2 I mean it's certainly moving up but it it was moving up from a relatively low level we could go take a look at New York um unemployment rate in New York is now at 4.5% so uh back in August it was at 3.9 and then four and then 4.2 and then 4.3 and now it's coming in at 4.5 and if we were to go take a look at at Texas that might be another interesting one to look at and perhaps Florida Texas is a state where you can actually see that the unemployment rate fell somewhat recently I mean again if if right if the unemployment rate is still at 3.7% there have to be some states right where the unemployment rate is actually going down I mean so far we've looked at ones where it was going up but there have to be some where it's going down if the unemployment rate is is staying stagnant at 3.7% but you can see that the unemployment rate in Texas uh the lowest at went this cycle was run 3.7 it then moved up to in the 4.1% range for a long time and then it just had a drop down to 4% and the last one I I think um unless I think of anything else I wanted to look at was uh was Florida Florida and maybe the District of Columbia Florida the unemployment rate still relatively low I mean again like we can always say yeah it is trending higher right I mean of course it is trending higher it was also trending higher over here here right but the angle of attack at this point wasn't that Steep and then the angle of attack steepened a lot and that's where the economy you know that's where the economy actually slowed down um even over here right in in in the unemployment rate in Florida in you know this cycle bottomed out in the low twos and it was slowly trending up but it took until this hit about 4% before the economy really slowed down and and it's currently at at 3% right and it was at you know it was at 2.8% a couple a couple of months ago um and then I did mention we can take a look at the distri District of Columbia this was one of the other ones kind of like California where it is it is higher right it's at 5.1% and it was looking it was a little optimistic after it had hit these highs back over here at 5.1 because it had come back down to 5% but then it's right back up to 5.1 so starting to go back up um hopefully I can find some other ones where it's going down just sort of show that in some in some states it has moved down Colorado it it actually increased um Massachusetts it is has increased as well um pretty big jump actually from 2.9 to 3.2 but you get the idea I mean again like the unemployment rate in a lot of these states it's going up but still at this point at a relatively low level okay but trending in the wrong direction but still at a Rel low level and you could even look at at like the number of states where the unemployment rate is rising um over the last month and see that over the last month there's 27 states where the unemployment rate has gone up right so there's clearly some that have stayed flat um or have have decreased this is only looking at ones that went up so right if it stayed flat then it's not included if you if you tune out a little bit of the noise and instead of looking at just one month ago you say all right well let's look three month months ago you can see that it it is at about 43 states have an unemployment rate higher um today than they did three months ago but it's potentially you know I mean you can see that it over here it came up to you know 242 back in October of 2022 um but then it fell right but then it fell as we got further into the year and then here it's found this at least local high in November of 20 23 last year it basically fell until January right January 2023 right it topped out in October it then fell in November a big drop in December and then it bottomed out in January here it's October November and then December right so this last year from October to November was a pretty big drop November to December was a pretty big drop here October to November it still went up November to December it did go down but only only slightly um so it could be interesting to see how the trend changes or what it does next month right like does it does it continue to go down is it lagging this one or is this just a very muted version of it and it's something more than just say cyclical um you could also look at it compared to six months ago which really Tunes out a lot of the noise and if you look at it compared to 6 months ago you can see that it's currently at 39 states have a higher unemployment rate today than 6 months ago um in October 2022 it reached 41 right so it reached 41 in October and then it fell basically it it fell through um through April and then it started to go up starting in April uh so we'll see if it you know if it follows a similar pattern or if it deviates we could also take a look at alternative unemployment rate measures right everyone knows this one here the standard unemployment rate which is u3 there's Al U1 which means greater than 15 weeks unemployed this is one that had been moving up more aggressively than than the other imployment rates in terms of rate of change but after moving up to 1.4 it's basically just hung around 1.4 1.3 and actually went down slightly in this most recent report we could also take a look at people not in the labor force um not super exciting of a metric to to look at it hasn't really done a whole lot but if you were to look at a year-over-year percentage change will take maybe a three-month moving average um you can see that it's it's slightly positive continuing on uh we have the labor force participation rate um that one stayed flat this last month looking at a year-over-year uh percentage change shows a pretty large drop basically from October um and now it's looking at it it's it's about 0.1% uh looking at the civilian Labor Force Level it looks like it dropped by about 175,000 um this is the civilian labor force level is the number of people who are either employed or unemployed but actively seeking employment um so that actually dropped by 175k taking a year over-year percentage change right you can see that it it was at 2.24% and then now it's down all the way to 847 per. so pretty large drop there in a in a short period period of time we also have the employment level so this is total nonfarm this is the the the blowout jobs report that we actually had today um if you were to zoom in here still trending higher right still very much trending higher but if you look at the month over Monon change I'm trying to remove the the the pandemic stuff you look at the month over Monon change also last month I believe was revised higher as well and so you can see that it's it's actually starting to go back up right like it isn't I mean it hasn't the monthly change hasn't put in a new low since December of 2022 as as you know as maybe as hard to believe as that is that's what this looks like now if you were to go look at the household survey it looks a lot more Grim uh where where you know where they've lost jobs by about the same amount that on the establishment survey that they've gained jobs but this is is is what the establishment survey says I'm looking at it on a quarter over quarter basis you can see that the quarter over quarter uh percentage change has started to accelerate slightly here at 0.55% and then finally looking at it on a year-over-year percentage change you could see that it's now down to about 1.89% that's total nonfarm we could uh switch it up and look at some other sectors uh there's like total private which also went up quite a bit I mean you might say well you is it just because the government or or something but total private jobs uh the unlo employment level went up by 317,000 pretty large month over Monon gain right pretty large month over month gain in fact in order to see a gain this much in a single month you'd have to go all the way back to in fact exactly a year ago right I don't know if you guys remember but we had a pretty large blowout number in January of 2023 right you can see see here I mean January 2023 we we saw the month-over-month change at 27% this January it's at2 36% right and taking a a simple moving average like a 3mon SMA you can see it's accelerated into that um maybe one other category and we'll look at at manufacturing manufacturing went up by about 23,000 so um pretty I mean not a huge change but still a a modest move up in manufacturing now let's go take a look at non-farm private payroll employment level uh if you're not familiar with this this is coming from the ADP the automatic data processing Research Institute this is a lot noisier than the establishment survey that we just looked at but you can see that they also added 107,000 jobs um when you're looking at at total private if you would if you switch this over to say manufacturing it they added only about about 2,000 jobs sometimes looking at a year-over-year percentage change is interesting I me you can see that it is shedding jobs right manufacturing jobs um have been have been dropping on a year-over-year percentage basis um but right there's still they still basically at the same level that they were pre pandemic right so yes they' they've dropped you every year but still at the same level as preep pandemic and there's other times in the past right where where they basically just trended sideways for a while um there's Leisure and hospitality is one that's always interesting to check in with it it's basically flatlined since July right it hasn't really made a huge move since July of last year I'm looking at a year-over-year percentage change it has it has you know come off its peak of 177% and it's now down to just about about 5% or so but I mean if if this doesn't start to go up soon then the year-over-year percentage change will of course continue to drop because I mean it's basically at the same level today in January as it was half a year ago right now of course we are you know as we go into into the summer we might see that go up from sort of like a seasonality basis but you get the idea um as to why the year of year percentage change hasn't really you know been going up as much because well it's basically been flat for the last six months um total temporary Help Services employees this has been one that has been in a in a decline for quite a while if you look closely it topped out in March of 2022 and it's been mostly moving down ever since uh but it actually did go up by about 3.9 th000 jobs um in this most recent report looking at a month-over-month percentage change this is actually the first positive print that we've seen in this metric really since March of 2022 we had a couple we had a few that came relatively close to putting in a positive print But ultimately they were unable to do so okay and this is one of those ones that looks a lot scarier when you look at it on a year-over-year percentage change basis um you know it's still at -7% and it's basically been around negative 7% um you know for for about a year now job openings uh continues to to slowly Trend down over a macro scale but in terms of locally it it has kind of leveled out here at this you know at around 8 to 9 million so it hasn't made another drop just yet and what a lot of this does is it really opens it sort of raises the question well where is the neutral rate you know is the neutral rate lower than where we currently are is it higher obviously Powell has said many times that we are clearly in restrictive territory but the question is is you know how restrictive is it or is it restrictive you know I mean if they if they paused here at 52% and the economy starts to re accelerate and byy Association inflation starts to re accelerate well that could that could certainly present um a problem but if is this just a fluke and I I think this goes back to why Powell is very you know resistant to the idea of a March rate cut how can you cut rates in March when you have you know unemployment rate still at secular lows when you have um you know blowout jobs report where you're gaining 300,000 jobs and I know a lot of people are going to say the numbers are made up and at but I you know that stuff doesn't matter right this is what monetary policy is based on and these are the numbers that we got right the the labor market is it is and it has been resilient it doesn't mean that it won't eventually fold that's what usually happens in tightening Cycles but the process the business cycle process can can take years to to ultimately play out so we will see you know I I think it's fair for Powell to say like we're probably not going to cut in March because we're only going to get two more data points for each series for most series between now and the next fed meeting um and and I mean for and for this stuff we're only going to get one more data point right we're only going to get one more unemployment rate print between now and the next March meeting because the March meeting's in in I you know late March but we're only going to get one more unemployment rate reading between now and then and I don't think there's going to be any I mean unless it comes in in February well above 4% I don't really think they're going to cut um so I and I I think it makes sense for them to just simply continue to hold there uh job openings in terms of manufacturing job openings it also it it slightly went up I'm still above the the pre-pandemic levels some some categories look a lot more Bleak like retail trade is is actually below prepandemic levels but it actually did get a a bit of a nice bounce here coming into the beginning of the year and and we can actually go back to last year and and see that you know December um marked a local high in job openings in the retail trade and then it trended down through basically March so we'll see if it does the same thing here or if it's a new trend and I think that's what Po's looking at is you know is this just like some type of seasonal Behavior where there's resilience in the labor market just like there was last January and then the next following few months it then went back down or is the economy starting to re accelerate and and and people are starting to get um you know are more jobs being created so I I think you know honestly I don't think they're going to cut in March I think something pretty catastrophic would have to happen between now and March for them to want to cut and and I I\n",

      "just like some type of seasonal Behavior where there's resilience in the labor market just like there was last January and then the next following few months it then went back down or is the economy starting to re accelerate and and and people are starting to get um you know are more jobs being created so I I think you know honestly I don't think they're going to cut in March I think something pretty catastrophic would have to happen between now and March for them to want to cut and and I I think really the question becomes not whether they're going to cut in March but whether they're going to cut in May um and I mean of course it depends on how the labor market unfolds between now and then but that's I think one thing we have to more so consider if you look at it from the other perspective right if you look at it not from the sense of of job openings or or or people that are you know getting or that are that have a job but if you look at Job quits you can see that people are still relatively scared to quit their job normally as as we get further and further into tightening Cycles um you know people are are less willing to quit because they're less likely to find another job a lot of people might not quit until they found another job um you know if you think about it most people don't go out and quit their job without having something else lined up but there's maybe fewer people having stuff lined up because you can see that job quits continues to drop and is now below the pre-pandemic level right and I mean you can see that you know in Prior economic downturns this metric was going down but the Counterpoint uh to all of that is while it has gone down it is still basically just back to where it was during you know pre pandemic right so yes this has basically just been getting been getting a lot of the excess out um now we're back to where we are pre- pandemic and I again I think Powell's right we have to get a few more data points here to make any conclusions what if a lot of these metrics just sort of stabilize at the current pre-pandemic levels if that's the case then you don't really have any strong reason to cut but if they if they continue to drop um relatively quickly then then of course you would have have more reason to to cut and I mean you could also look at look at it in terms of like retail trade I mean you can see that in terms of retail trade job quit are at 423,000 the last time they were this low was back in 2015 so some sectors are certainly taking a bigger hit than others in terms of you know the flexibility of people to sort of quit their job and and just go find a new job and then there's also the job quits rate which is basically the same thing um initial claims still coming in relatively low as I've said before you know if you're if you're thinking about like recession recessionary type initial claims I think you'd have to see this in the 300,000 range um for it to be recessionary and so we're clearly not there at this time and so I would not say that this constitutes as recessionary Behavior Uh right now um it has moved up here a little bit off the lows uh do note that in January you know December January 2022 uh or sorry December 2021 January 2022 it it had a move up um same thing January 2023 right it had to move up so um I I guess the question is is you know is it is it doing something similar where it comes down here puts in a low and then just Trends higher going into the middle part of the year which certainly could be the case right that certainly could be the case um it but he even put in a lower low compared to where it was last January right last January initial claims bottomed out at 194,000 this January they bottomed out at 189,000 with that said they've already shot up to 224,000 which last year it took until the end of February for them to reach that level and so the the stuff on the on the weekly is is relatively noisy I would always recommend putting in some type of of moving average in there whether it be a 3-we SMA or a sevene SMA to maybe get a better read on it you can also look at initial claims per state but it is really really noisy and this stuff is not seasonally adjusted uh we could go look at continued claims continued claims continue to sort of show that while people haven't been getting laid off as much um there are still a significant number of people that are having a harder time finding a new job right so you know while people might be getting laid off at the same rate there's still a lot of people that are hard having a hard time finding a new job and that's why contined claims continues to go up and and really you can see that um a year ago in in January 2023 it was at 1.65 million now remember initial claims was the same essentially as it was in January 2023 but and um but continued claims in January 2023 was at 1.63 million today it's at 1.9 million okay so you have another 300,000 people that are putting in continued claims compared to last year right so the the the layoff rate as it's essentially the same maybe a little bit higher but the number of people having a harder time finding a new job continues to to slowly go up and I mean you can see that here January it's starting to to move up again if you were to go look at last January um it it it essentially started I mean it was already moving up going into January kind of like how it was over here but didn't find any type of local top until until April so that's um continued claims uh we also have continued claims per state obviously not seasonally adjusted so not that useful but you can also look at the number of states where like the percentage year-over-year change of continued claims is going up um if you want to buy a certain percentage here we'll say Okay 30% you can see that the number of states where the year-over-year change was 30% or more reached a high at 27 States back in November it is now since dropped all the way down to five and now it's back up to eight uh per the most recent reports number of states where the percentage year-over-year change in initial claims is greater than 30% um uh hit a high last year in July at 18 and it just hit a a pretty low level of one uh in December and now it's all the way back up to 16 and this is what of course it looks like in the grand scheme of things certainly some areas in the past where it had some spikes up but it didn't do anything uh it looks like in order to be squarely in re Cession territory you would need to see this metric go up to above maybe 25 or so like if half the country if half the country has you know uh if if half the number of states has a year-over-year percentage change of initial claims that are greater than 30% that has historically lined up with a recession uh but we're just simply not there yet and there's no guarantee that we get there I mean you can see that again in July 2023 it went all the way up to 18 but then it just came right back down highers is another one that looks pretty weak right so so some of the some of the metrics look strong some of them look weak new highers still looks relatively weak right I mean it did get a move up this past month but still likely in a larger downtrend always possible it's going to bottom out you know I mean it's going to bottom out somewhere I don't know where that's going to be and it's possible that it already has but clearly the FED if you look at something like this there's no way to know if if it's bottomed out or not and there's no way to know it because there's lags in monetary policy we don't know the full extent of it and until many years later and it's only obvious really in in hindsight so again I know a lot of that's confusing because there's so much there's so much data but there's there's actually a cool thing we can do we can actually look at at sort of you know we can normalize prior behavior and and look to see you know is it recessionary or is it not and we actually have it by categories here interest rates production and business national income and product and employment and in terms of employment while some risks are slightly elevated they're still relatively low and even across the board the main risk that is elevated is just yield curve risk right interest rate risk and the problem of course is that the longer they take to go to to lose monetary policy the more they risk this risk over here spilling over into these other categories but again it's really hard to know exactly when that's going to occur and it's you know impossible to you know to time that perfectly um and there are cases in the past where the FED has it achieved a soft landing and so I think that's always something you should keep in the back of your mind 1967 was one the mid1 1990s was another if you were to go take a look closer at at some of the the risk stuff say the unemployment rate risk it's at 0.005 right really really low it it was starting to spike in October but now it's come right back down um the one with the highest risk is job openings because job openings has continued to fall that risk has been all over the place right I mean it's gone up it's gone down but until it really goes up and stays elevated um you know it's hard to hard to know exactly when it's you know when it's going to hit um and then maybe finally we could look at at continued claims risk you know it's popped up a little bit over over recent months but even recently it's it's Fallen back in a little bit so interesting way to view the markets um we could also go look at very quickly we could go look at the S um I believe it was the oh yeah the Su rule recession indicator so if you look at the S rule indicator uh it actually dropped back down so what this means is when it crosses the gray line that is a a recession signal we haven't crossed it yet so that signal has not yet been given and again I know people might be frustrated by by certain things you know by you know whether you whether you want it to just go back down and have a soft Landing or whether you want there to be a a um a surge in this stuff just so the FED will finally pivot and and maybe the smaller businesses will start to do well it's important to remember that the business cycle takes years to play out right you should not be looking at this sort of stuff and saying all right this has got to happen on on a really small time frame when we know it can simply take years for it to it to play out um so please keep that in mind and and if you we actually have the Som rule recession indicator per state so we've coded it up to have it per state and um uh you can see like in Alabama it has not triggered but I imagine I imagine it it has triggered in California yeah it has triggered in California I imagine it has triggered in the District of Columbia right it has um in Florida probably not right it hasn't it's getting closer but it has not yet triggered um in Texas it probably hasn't we just saw the unemployment rate I believe go down yeah so you can see that it actually went down and New York I don't think it has I could be wrong um it's in New York it is getting I mean it's getting relatively close right it's at 0 433 um so 0. five is is the threshold so in some states it's getting closer um a lot closer than than others and then you can also look at simply the number of states where the Su rule has triggered and um you can see that it has been recently going up right it it found a local top last year um or in in late 2022 of of of 13 it then went all the way back down to two for a lot of 2023 and now it starting to go back up right so it went from two 2 to 6 to 11 and then now it's at 18 so that means now 18 states have triggered the S Rule now the S rule was not designed at a state level in mind but if you did take some leeway and and apply it to that then you could see that 18 states have now triggered the S rule we could also go take a look at smooth recession probabilities still relatively low um only uh as of December 2023 the odds that we were in a recession are only 74% so relatively low odds that they will back data recession to you know to the end of 2023 at this point given you know given the smooth us recession probability indicator we could also go take a look at the Kansas City fed labor market conditions index continues to slowly drop but still well above the zero line um it's currently coming in at at 78 there's also the Kansas City fed labor market conditions index um which I think it's probably worthwhile to apply some type of a of a moving average to this and you can see that it's basically just sort of oscillating around zero so not a whole lot of growth um but it also it clearly does not look like you know these draw Downs at this point so we've covered a lot um you know as a reminder in terms of how does this affect you as an investor the one thing I will I will continue to reiterate and I I've said many many times over over the years is that you know the further you get into tightening Cycles um the more you know the more those higher market cap stuff outperforms the lower market cap stuff and the reason is because the balance sheet of companies like apple and meta and and and and alphabet and Microsoft right and and Nvidia the balance sheet of those companies are really healthy and and a lot of investors can look at that and say all right you know these companies they will survive whatever comes next right they will survive it because they're not going to go anywhere Even If the Fed does push us in into a Slowdown right the problem is that the lower market cap stuff they're not getting that Lifeline right like think about all the small businesses that just started their company a year ago they're not necessarily they don't necessarily have you know billions of dollars of cash on hand to fall back on and so what happened today right you have the S&P up you have the NASDAQ up because the mega cap Tech stuff are doing really really well right meta is up 20% today alone by by the way you know meta was was a company back in late 2022 I I was very vocal on ITC premium that regardless of e of if a recession ever does come I said that $100 less than $100 is extremely deep value on on something like meta and now what's crazy is a mega cap Tech stock is up essentially 5x since then you know we talk about you know Bitcoin and I also bought some Bitcoin back then but but Bitcoin is is only up about 3x I mean you're talking about a mega cap tech company up 5x in in just over a year and and I again you know the the receipts are there on ITC premium where we talked about how even if there is an eventual slowdown meta will likely not take out this low and what will more likely happen is it'll just put in a a much higher low okay um so the issue of course for you know for for for lower Market market cap stuff is that the higher the the money just keeps getting diverted into all these Mega caps because investors are more confident that the mega caps can actually survive right and you know money wants to find a home it wants to find yield somewhere and so it gets diverted into the mega cap stuff the problem is look at the Russell today right it's down half a percent right it's down and why is that well because a lot of the companies in the Russell they don't have you know tens of billions of dollars to fall back on and all this means all the labor market report means is that the FED is now further away from cutting than they were a few weeks ago now the market is thinking there's only a 21 a half% Chance is going to be a rate cut in March so the companies that are relying on looser monetary policy to increase demand those companies now have to wait even longer to see that right they have to wait even longer longer to to get to the point where they can say all right great we have lower interest rates therefore we're going to get more demand um and and and and then their stock price goes up right that has been pushed out so that the issue for the smaller market cap stuff is the further and further and further that rate Cuts get pushed out some of these companies just they say enough is enough and they go bankrupt right they lay people off and so that's where we are in the business cycle is that these a lot of these smaller companies right they are going those are the ones going bankrupt laying people off and a lot of the money is getting diverted into the higher market cap stuff that people are more confident will survive long term that's at least my interpretation of it and and you can really understand it even better by looking at say like the valuation of the Russell against the NASDAQ right the Russell continues to bleed to the NASDAQ As We are continuing to go into looser and looser monetary policy do you see this or in as we're going further into into tightening not loer monetary policy do you see these months here right there's like you know about half a year here where the Russell outperformed the NASDAQ that was after we got back into QE and loose monetary policy but the further we go into Tighter and Tighter monetary policy and by the way you don't have to raise rates to go into tighter monetary policy it could just be that you them there for a while right think about how many companies would really like there to be lower interest rates I mean even on the on the earnings call with Tesla I believe they were talking about how you know some of their demand issues are just because of rates are so high and if rates could come back down that would bring demand back but if you're the FED how do you lower rates with blowout job reports like we just saw because if you do if you do lower rates too soon then you run the risk of inflation reaccelerating just like it did in the 1970s where by the way it came down here to 3% and then it started to re accelerate okay the FED doesn't want that we're at 3% right headline inflation has been at 3% since June it hasn't it's been sticky it hasn't made that move core inflation has has um you know it it's been moving down but not as quickly as the FED would like and so the again the issue is that until we get back to loose to monetary policy those lower market cap stuff are not going to do as well as as the higher market cap stuff now that doesn't mean they can't ever go up in value right if the higher market cap stuff goes up it can lift the other stuff up but it just means there's not as much money going into those other other other places just simply because investors are spooked if they can even survive the tightening cycle and that's it goes back to these you know all these ideas that we presented about higher market cap stuff doing better and and lower risk stuff doing better than higher risk stuff and the higher risk stuff will likely start to do better on the other side of rate Cuts but at this point I don't think the argument is whether we get a rate cut in March I think the argument is do we get even get a rate cut in May the FED has said many times they're probably only going to cut I think in their Dot Plot In the SCP the summary economic the summary of economic projections they've said uh they're likely only only going to cut three times this year and the market is still pricing in you know five rate Cuts they were pricing in six now they're pricing in five but they there's a good chance that the market is still you know still has too high of of expectations and if you go back to the last um um cutting cycle you can see in 2019 in 2019 they only cut three times right they cut in July September and October July September and October so you know maybe the FED Cuts in May but if they do then they maybe they cut in July so maybe they do May July and November or maybe they delay it until June and they do june September and December that could be something that plays out so I think it you know I think it makes sense to be open-minded about about that and um and to remember that you know as it relates to you\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The unemployment rate remained relatively flat at 3.7%, but some states like California and the District of Columbia have seen higher unemployment rates, potentially due to the impact of tightening on smaller tech companies.\n",

      "2. The employment level, as measured by the establishment survey, showed a significant increase, with the private sector adding 317,000 jobs in the latest report, the largest monthly gain in a year, suggesting the economy is still creating jobs at a robust pace.\n",
      "\n",

      "The additional context provides further insights into the potential implications of the jobs report for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and the performance of different sectors of the economy. The transcript suggests that the longer the Fed maintains its restrictive stance, the more the higher market capitalization companies may outperform the lower market capitalization companies, as investors seek safer havens. This dynamic is driven by the stronger balance sheets and greater resilience of the larger firms compared to smaller businesses that may struggle to survive the tightening cycle. The author also discusses the potential timing of future interest rate cuts, noting that the market may be pricing in more cuts than the Fed is likely to deliver this year.\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the equity verse today we're going to talk about Tesla and we're going to be providing a General Market Outlook if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse got wrong and reflect on that and talked about talk about you know things that went my way um at at various points and then I just I I want to talk about my my current views on Tesla and and what I really think about its Outlook over the next few years okay so I'm going to go through this as systematically as I can try to cover all bases and um we'll just take from there so back in in 2017 2018 2019 you know my view on Tesla was that it was undervalued okay I I you know I was very optimistic about Tesla's future back over here and I thought it was only a matter of time before we got a larger move to the upside in Tesla okay the move that eventually came exceeded all of my prior expectations you know I would have just I mean if you look at at this move here from July 2010 to to this high that was a 2300 per move imagine telling someone that we would exceed that right from this low here to that high was a 41 100% move so the move by Tesla far exceeded my expectations right I did not think it was going to go as high as this and I I certainly became increasingly cautious on it as it as it climbed this entire you know this entire move okay and in early 2022 when it was apparent that we were going into a bare market right the S&P I'm not I mean not Tesla specifically but the S&P when it became increasingly apparent that we were going into a a bare Market I was very bearish on Tesla very bearish on it and for a while that bearishness was in fact rewarded we had a series of lower highs that so many people remained bullish on because they were still living in this move right they were still living in the in the by the dip you know by the dip mentality it's going to go to new all-time highs immediately right and what ended up happening is the asset then dropped 75% almost 7 6% so a 76% drop and you know there's a lot of people that were in the in the sort of the buy the dip mode now the first thing I will say before we get too much further into this video is you know there's there's definitely two types of people I think when it comes to to Tesla um there well I mean there's there's two of the most common types are Perma bears and Perma Bulls over long per periods of time in the stock market while both can be rewarded at various phases it it's better to be bullish over a long period of time right if you can weather 70 to 80% moves to the downside then in general for the stock market it's better to be a Perma bull than a Perma Bear right it's okay to be cautious but that's you know it sort of goes back to the saying of um you know the Bears sound smart the Bulls make money but I I want to talk about this draw down by Tesla and talk about whether this is the low here right like the the current drop is that the final low um or do we take out this low or do we take out that low so again to recap I was fairly optimistic on Tesla back over here it then far exceeded my expectations I became very bearish on it very very bearish on it and I was looking at a potential 77% drop at least at least I did a video on it Tesla a textbook bubble and at the time Tesla was 122 and in this video I put out you know two potential targets I believe from memory um I I said that you know the first sort of Target would be about a 77% drop the reason that I arrived at at a 77% drop one of the reasons was because I mean if you go look at at at Bitcoin Bitcoin had a a 77% drop I say well so what well Netflix also had a 77% drop right 77% I mean if I if I actually get you know the exact top or so I mean it's 76.9 6% or so so what meta 76% drop so almost 77% right almost 77% drop so I was looking around I'm like well look I mean you got you got meta that's already dropped 77% you had Netflix that dropped 77% bit coin dropped 77% it seems like it's possible that Tesla could drop 77% and so what I did was in this video we sort of Drew out where where that price would be if it dropped around 77% and it was just below $100 right just below $100 and so that was sort of an initial an initial price target of hey it's possible that this thing could drop to less than $100 now at the time I was definitely living off of a high because I you know I really liked Tesla but I was very bearish on it after watching this 4,000% rally and also throughout this entire bare Market saying look it's going to keep going down and saying look okay maybe it goes down about 77% now what's interesting is it did drop almost that but not quite 75% 75 and a half% or so um so it you know it didn't make it 76% and it didn't make it 77% which is what some of the other ones did right so it you know the other stocks that we were looking at and even even Bitcoin went down about 77% and so for me I was looking at it thinking hey what if Tesla goes down the same amount then it would put it at just below $100 and then I think I put out a worst case out outcome of of of in the 60s right that's what I did I mean the receipts are there yes I mean I I could try to hide behind it and pretend like the video doesn't exist but the the video does exist and you know as an investor i' I'd prefer to try to like learn from my mistakes than than hide behind them and pretend like they didn't happen I I think one thing that is is that that that can be frustrating with you know being a sort of a a for lack of a better word content creator um especially in the in sort of the financial space I think one of the hard Parts is that everyone sort of pits themselves against each other and and they sort of like you know for bragging rights and and and dunking you know dunking rights my sort of view that I've I've tried to adapt over the over the last few years which I'm not always successful at is you know don't dunk on others lest you be dunked on because often times when you get to the point where you want to dunk on someone else for having the wrong view that's usually the time when you should be shifting your own view right it's you know it it happens constantly with investing where like you have a view it turns out to be right and then you want to go dunk on other people but rather than wasting your time dunking on other people for being right you should just be changing your own view to you know to Pro to provide an example I mean you know I was very bearish on Tesla throughout all of these lower highs right all these lower highs and and then when I watched it finally drop to that 77% Target I was sorry I didn't mean to pull up that one I was very very happy because I'm like look I was right it made sense to be bearish on this thing and and it could go less than $100 and it felt like I was you know I was um you know I I I basically could say look it was not wrong to to scoff at the idea of buying these dips over here the problem here's the issue with you know with investing and especially being a content creator in the space is that despite the fact that all of these are lower highs and unfortunately these are still lower highs and there's no guarantee that the that the trend changes but despite that the people that remained perable throughout this entire phase they're going to act like they were right right because it's you know it's off the lows right it's off the lows by about 100% right of course the problem is they were also buying it throughout this entire phase and so yes while it's off the lows it's it's one of those things where you know a lot of those positions are are still likely underwater but again with investing you you you shouldn't spend too much your time worrying about what other people think um and what their views are just look at the bigger picture I think that's what makes sense look at the bigger picture and then see what's happened so far Tesla has been putting in lower Highs but this is also a significant low I don't know if we're going to take out that low the problem is that I like Tesla as a you know as a as a company I think it is the Blue Chip EV stock right I mean if you think about like all the EV I think Tesla is the Blue Chip it's like it's like the uh Bitcoin of the cryptoverse right so like Bitcoin is the Blue Chip of the cryptoverse Tesla's the Blue Chip of of EVs and you know I I found myself in a position over the last several years where I used to be bullish on it over here and then I watched this happen and it and it's just been really hard you know to to to not look for sort of the bearish view um but I also you know I also don't want to be you know feel like I I I can't speak up about my mind on Tesla just because it it bottomed out here 1% higher than than the target you know the initial Target that I set um you know that video that I made at 122 was here and I said all right you know the sort of the initial Target would be around the high 90s and you can see that it it basically found down a low at at just above that the 100s one lesson is that sometimes it's close enough right sometimes it's close enough it doesn't have to be exact you know if you're buying an if you're buying an equity 77 75 76% off the low like meta like neet like Netflix whatever as long as you think that company's going to survive it makes sense for the record on ITC premium I was very bullish on meta at 77% down and the reason was because I had I just watched Netflix do the same same type of move so like look at Netflix Netflix made that 77% drop so I was watching meta make that same drop and then I I you know I put out a lot of telegram posts on the ITC premium stuff when it was below a 100 and saying look guys this is a great opportunity to get into meta right anything below $100 is extremely valuable extreme value so I was hoping to make that same sort of an announcement with Tesla and and it didn't it didn't hit that 77% threshold that's my own mistake right that's my own mistake um I think that you know it would have been just like you know after it's 75% down or even hell 70% down you know it would have been okay to say you know from this point while it could go lower it probably won't go too much lower so that's sort of my view on on you know how I in the future I think it would make sense to sort of view these larger draw Downs is that when you get like these larger moves to the downside to not you know to not get so worked up over whether it goes 76% down or if it's 77% down right because then you know the people that were you know that were bullish on it throughout this entire phase will claim that they're right even though it's still lower than literally every every single one of these lower highs right but they'll still act like that was the right view to have and it's just not a fun it's not a fun experience right you know to sort of go through that so I I want to talk now sort of now that we've gotten that out of the way and now that I've sort of raised my hand to say look um to put out a target of just below 100 and and potentially as low as 60 was you know probably not the best way that I should have handled that I mean I you know I think I should have just said hey while it could go down to 77% down is it worth is it worth waiting for that might have been a better way to handle it now that brings us to sort of today like where are we today and and and what does that mean you know does it mean that we we can't take out the low or could we take out the low and and I just want to provide some thoughts onto that I think there's sort of two outcomes here right and I don't think I mean I don't think these outcomes are are should be that surprising I think the first outcome is that if we don't go into a recession then I think this is the low right so if a recession is avoided then I think the low is in for Tesla if a recession is not avoided then we could certainly go to that low and it would it would in fact be interesting if at the end of the day we ended up going 77% down but it just took a lot longer right like I mean you know like if it if it still went that 77% drop but it just took a little bit longer to get there and it would take a recession I think to get there I don't think it will go to less than 100 I mean it looks like it went to 101 81 right I don't think it's going to go sub 100 unless you get a recession so if a recession comes good chance Tesla takes out the low the problem with with some of these you know with some of these stocks like this is that you know if a re recession happens then you know these other stocks that are already so much higher like Netflix I mean it's so high that even if it were to drop from here I mean even if it were to drop 60% it's still putting in a higher low right and there's no guarantee that it's going to do anything like that right like even if meta were to drop 50% it's still a much higher low or if it dropped say you know 30% right but I mean even in a in even like in a in a you know recession recessionary environment if it were to drop 50% that's still a higher low and that was what I told people on ITC premium with meta back when it was sub 100 is that this is likely the low regardless because it's so far down it went that 77% drop it's probably the low the regardless so even if you do get a recession things like meta would likely just put in a higher low the problem for other assets like Tesla is that if a recession occurs before it gets a larger move to the upside then a 50% drop would put it at that 77% draw down Target right that's where it would put it so I I think it's relevant to keep that in mind that like that could happen and I I I I think it's it's foolish to say that it can't happen but I'll also say it's foolish to say that it has to happen okay I'm of the opinion that if it does happen it would be a great opportunity but there's no guarantee that it does and we don't have a ton of History to go on for Tesla but there is a similar type of move once upon a time where it had a larger move to the upside and you can even see there was these levels that it tried holding and there was one Wick below it right and you can see that throughout this entire phase on either side of this Wick it tested this level here right this level right here and so I do wonder if we're repeating a similar type of thing right where you test these lows right you you have a major impulsive move to the upside and following that you you sort of set a floor and then you go in and you capitulate below it at some point just like we did right here and then you continue to test that floor for a while and then eventually you get another move up now if Tesla were to follow that pattern then what it would look like right I if we just sort of overlay it what that could mean would be you know this this move here started in in like late 2016 and then it found a you know found this High here about half a year later so what it could mean is you know Finding support around here and then bouncing up to slightly new Highs coming all the way back down and retesting this low again you know I this occurred you know three to you know about three years later um so that would be like you know testing it in like 2027 as crazy as that sounds um and then going up that's essentially what it would look like if we were to emulate that move right basically you know hanging out in here for a while and then eventually moving back up this low here occurred during a recession scare we did not actually get a recession in February 2016 but it was a recession scare and so I don't know I mean I I look we have an inverted yield curve we we've got all the signs that the labor market is slowly softening up but there's also a chance that the FED pivots before things get too bad maybe they pivot too late and we do go into a recession and in that case Tesla could take out that low but you know I just want to be like open and honest I mean I I used to be very very bullish on Tesla back when it was you know in 2017 2018 and 2019 before this 4,000% move um I was very bearish on it in 2022 I was also pretty bearish on it even in sort of the parts of 2021 I mean we still had this major move up I mean this really I think through most of 2021 I I wasn't that optimistic on it I felt like the larger part of the move was behind us than it was I mean we did go about 40% higher if memory serves me correct yeah about 40% higher but I mean if you're if you're sitting on gains of like several thousand perc I don't that's where people don't care as much and that's the hard part is that like you you have some people that get in over here and they're happy to just kind of sit out after it's up 2,000% you get the late people that come in that buy it up here and they get super loud when it goes up another 40% you're like well okay fine I missed out on a 40% move but so what I I still realized a 2,000% move and to be completely honest and transparent I do have a Tesla position that I held throughout this entire thing right I mean I I have you know some that I've held throughout the entire thing throughout the entire 76% draw down and everything I do have some but in terms of you know looking to get larger positions um I you know I hadn't been on the lookout for that right because I was looking I was looking at meta Netflix and saying all right 77% down that's the Target and then we ended up bottoming out at like 75 and a half% down and so kind of a an element of of watching The Market get close not hit the target but I think you know maybe it was close enough right maybe it was close enough so from here one thing to consider is that after a lot of these earnings reports Tesla has bounced after getting a a 10% drop right so I think this is now four earnings in a row where following earnings Tesla has dropped 10% and and then after that there's been some form of of mean reversion right there's been some form of mean reversion and um you know whether it is just a a smaller bounce back up to you know basically where we are now we've seen that maybe a little bit higher or whether it was a a larger bounce up to you know the mid2 200s this bounce here actually took you to new highs um all sorts of bounces that we've gotten off of these lows right some have been smaller right some have been 40% move this was a 130% move this one here was about a 10% move um and then so far this one has been about a a 10% move so I I think when you look at it like that you have to think well I mean it's you know it's it's relatively um you know there's a chance that there's some form of mean reversion right where regardless of whether we break the Integrity of this low there could be some form of mean reversion just like there was back in late 2022 right and just like there was in in May of 2021 and just like there was in March of 2021 right there could be some form of mean reversion and one way to maybe visualize that is to go look at the relative strength index of Tesla and you can in fact see that on the daily it hit the same level that it hit during the crash in December of 2022 right the daily RSI hit that same level so that's why I'm saying like you know there there there can always be this sort of this mean reversion play um that could that could play out before you figure out what the actual move is going to be right whether it's a move back higher into the mid into the into the high 200s or whether you you go back down and you you sort of break the Integrity this low again A lot of times there's some form of of mean reversion so I think the way that I'm I'm viewing Tesla right now is if no if no if soft Landing right if if we achieve a soft Landing then this is probably the low if we have a hard Landing then we could easily test the Integrity of that low I can't possibly know if it's going to be a soft\n",

      "whether it's a move back higher into the mid into the into the high 200s or whether you you go back down and you you sort of break the Integrity this low again A lot of times there's some form of of mean reversion so I think the way that I'm I'm viewing Tesla right now is if no if no if soft Landing right if if we achieve a soft Landing then this is probably the low if we have a hard Landing then we could easily test the Integrity of that low I can't possibly know if it's going to be a soft Landing or hard Landing there's there's evidence to support both cases right I mean there's there's there are prior cases where you have soft Landings um 1967 is one but even in that case you know we ended up getting a hard Landing two years later but still I mean it was an example of a soft landing and for investment time frames you know two years a long time there have been soft Landings that have been achieved even I think of the mid 1990s I think they've you know you could look at it and say some soft Landings were achieved um even after or maybe the late 1990s even after a briefly inverted yield curve so I think you know I think you if you if if a soft Landing is achieved then that could be the low if we have a hard Landing then maybe it just goes down to that 7 7% level which is just slightly below that low right so I don't really know I mean I don't really know which one of those is going to play out but I will say that I I I want to be you know I want I want to be more open-minded so that I I can I feel like I can talk about Tesla in the future rather than just you know waiting to see if it ever comes back down to this low I don't know if it's going to right I really don't I mean um this low here was actually tested in or this low here was put in in in q1 of the election year which is where we are right now right it's q1 of the election year um so you could you could look at it like this and say all right that capitulation corresponds to that one or maybe you know maybe there's some type of of low put in this quarter if you were to go look at at say um so on into the Crypt verse premium we have an equity Tab and you can actually filter by equities you have Tesla if you go look at say the year-to-date Roi of Tesla in say 2024 compared to 2012 you can see that we dip early on and then we get a bounce look at it 2016 we dipped early on and then we got a bounce and in 2016 it actually dipped even further down right about 40% down off the yearly open which is exactly what you're looking at right there right so 40% down off the yearly open for Tesla would be approximately in the 150s okay now I know what you're saying well I mean you're saying well what about the daily RSI you just showed that it was basically oversold that's true I mean it it it is um the Counterpoint of course is that major crashes can also happen from oversold Levels by Major crashes can happen from oversold levels so I think that while it is possible that we take out the low if if we get a hard Landing um I don't think it makes sense to like basically bet everything on that idea okay because it might not happen this could be the low here like we could be putting in the low here if it wants to follow 2016 maybe it goes into the uh into the 150s and then puts in say like a slightly higher low there's that chance of of occurring as well or worst case scenario we we test the Integrity of that low right there under a hard Landing it's possible that you could test that that the problem for me as you know as as someone who likes to talk about assets the problem is that you know I want to be able to talk about Tesla even if we don't take out that low and just say you know I mean I I should have been more willing to flip then rather than you know rather than just sort of watch this move on F again I can rationalize it in my own mind by saying well I mean look I mean you know it's not like being bearish on it throughout these highs has paid or being bullish on it throughout these highs has paid off we have Tesla has not reclaimed those highs it has not um I mean we came pretty close but we have not reclaimed those highs just yet so I don't think it was wrong to be bearish on it here I think where I was wrong was not just saying hey this is close enough okay and again I mean given enough time as enough as you know as more time goes by the likelihood of it of it eventually putting in new highs goes up over long period the time Bulls are more are are rewarded more frequently than Bears right I mean bulls can have you know can have um can get completely wiped out during draw Downs like this because what what often happens is people buy it all the way down and then they capitulate at the bottom and then they they watch they sell he here and then they watch it just go back up I was you know I basically was bearish on it through here but I I did not turn bullish on it right here because I thought it could go down you know another few perc that was a mistake I think that was a mistake um and so I I do hope sort of learn from that in the future sometimes I think it's just um it's good enough and that goes whether we take out the low or not I mean I think that if we if we do take out this low then I could still say well you know technically speaking but I I think the problem with that is that you know I don't know that it was worth you know just watching it go up 200% and not knowing if it's going to come back down I mean it it's come back down a lot here I mean I know a lot of people are looking at it right here I mean it's down it's down 40 you know 35 40% in in just the last few months right in about the last half year so that's a pretty large draw down for you know for something like Tesla um in fact if you were to look at at quarterly returns for Tesla it's down 23% this quarter you remember in 2016 when it was down 40% off the yearly open it still closed the year the the quarter only down 4% so that's why I'm saying I mean there's there's a chance that there's some type of mean reversion right where you know I don't know if it's going to get a smaller bounce like it did right here uh or sorry like right like right sorry I didn't even draw out at the right spot I don't know if it's going to get a a smaller bounce like it did right here or if it'll be a larger bounce like some of these other ones but it's getting something okay so if if we get an uninverted yield curve in the next few months and a hard Landing happens and the FED has to cut aggressively then it's possible that you take out this low if on the other hand that doesn't happen and the FED just starts to slowly cut and nothing bad happens then I I imagine the demand would slowly start to come back for Tesla one of the issues I think and I think a lot of the reasons why it's been selling off after the last four earning sessions was because the market has been rewarding good earnings and and you know punishing bad and Tesla's been reducing their prices on a lot of these EVs and their margins are getting squeezed they're they're reducing their prices I imagine because demand has slowed I mean don't take it from me they they said as much that that demand has slowed down and part of the reason is because of higher interest rates right I mean the you know if you're going to get a loan to uh to buy Tesla the interest rate is a lot higher now than it used to be and so a lot of these companies are hoping that the FED will pivot so that we go back to lower rates so that then demand starts to come back so I will say this if a soft Landing if we have a soft Landing then the low is probably n if it's a hard Landing then we could certainly test the Integrity of that low I don't know which one's going to play out but I will say I think it is foolish to assume that one of those has to play out right if you go into it saying that a hard Landing has to play out then you run the risk of of having watched it drop down to this low again which is basically you know kind of the same the same pattern from back over here right of sort of getting that chance and and and then potentially watching it go to new highs right that could happen right something like that could happen if we get a soft Landing but the Counterpoint is that if we get a hard Landing then it's already only 50% above I mean it's it would only take a 50% drop to get down to the prior low or about a 45% drop to get down to the prior low from where we currently are um and so if you're if you're getting a larger draw down in the market you know I mean while while if meta drops 30 or 40% or if if Netflix drops 30 or 40% they're still putting in higher lows but if if something's already suppressed and it drops 30 or 40% then it could easily test those prior lows so that's why I think it you know it it it makes sense to be more open-minded about it than I was back over here so I think you know to to do with that information what you will I will be on the lookout to see that if it can you know if it can hold these lows right if it can stay above these lows then there's a good chance that this is not tested right like imagine we get an uninverted gu curve sometime the next couple of quarters and um and you know the economy just continues to sort of hum along in that type of scenario then you probably don't break the low but if the fed's forced to cut because we get some type of you know deflationary spiral then that's where you know that's where it could potentially break so those are the risks I think involved to the upside and the downside there's there's two different types of risk right there's the risk that it goes up and people get left behind and there's also the risk that it goes down and the people that are are betting the family farm on it now watch watch it get you know rinsed another 40 to 50% I think it it makes sense to hedge um I I think it would be foolish to assume that either of those scenarios have to happen Okay so that is my view on Tesla I just wanted to sort of come on here and say look I know I I was bearish on it throughout this entire phase I did not flip on it here um I I I I think here I'm I'm more so taking a a neutral stance that if it can hold these lows over the next few months then it's probably going to hold this if it if it breaks down here over the next few months in some type of larger market crash or or or Draw down as we come out of an inverted Yi curve then you could test that low um but I don't think it would go that much lower than that low right like it could go a little bit lower in a hard Landing but it probably wouldn't go that much lower I think we'll go and wrap it up there um and you know I'll just you know add this video on there so that you guys can you know to the playlist so that it's there for the records and and we'll check back in with Tesla maybe maybe at the end of the quarter and see if it's if it's managing to hold these lows still or if we you know if it if it broke down and and we we retested up I think grand scheme of things five years from now it's not going to matter um so do with that information what you will but in the next year it's really hard to say I think you can look at prior examples and come up with reasons why it could hold but then you could look at other things um you know like yield curve inversion and and rate cuts and say look I mean if it plays out like prior Cycles it it could be could be kind of nasty but it's impossible to say for sure anyways we'll wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and I'll see you guys next time bye\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin the beauty of mathematics Part 42 if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom link is in the description below or the pinned comment we're going to go through a few charts in this video we'll of course touch base on the normal ones that we look at in this video series but will also talk about a few others it is the first of the month but it is also the first day of the year of 2024 and so it might be nice to just take a look at some other charts within this video to get a better grasp on where we potentially are within the current market cycle so every month on the first of the month generally speaking I try to make a video where we take a step back from the short-term price action and look more so at longer term trends to better understand periods of undervaluation and overvaluation that is the general purpose of these of the the beauty of mathematics series and as you can see the blue line here is the actual total market cap of the entire asset class and we go through periods of overvaluation and undervaluation and often times when we are overvalued we can be overvalued for a year or more and when we're undervalued we can be undervalued for a year or more you can see that we first entered into the undervaluation territory in June of 2022 so it's been about a year and a half now as of January 1st 2024 the total market cap of the entire asset class is coming in at a modest 1.69 5 trillion with a fair value logarithmic aggression trend line at 2.24 n trillion this represents an undervaluation of approx imately 24.6 5% now the general idea that we've discussed is that as the market goes from being undervalued to being overvalued there can be rotations of capital and one of the things that we mentioned going into 2023 is that the Bitcoin dominance will likely go up for the entire year as capital rotates from the altcoin market to bitcoin in overvaluation territory what often happens is the Bitcoin dominance can start to come back down over o especially after that initial move but we're still well you know we're still well in the undervaluation territory right now we can overlay the risk metric onto this chart this is the total summary risk metric that takes into account not only the price risk but also the onchain risk and the social risk and when you combine all those and you color code the current price action by that risk metric you get a chart that looks like this and so you can see that we've been at relatively low risk levels back in in late 2022 ever since then the risk level has been a little bit higher and recently the total risk has has actually been trending trending up quite a bit given the onchain risk has gone up so much and of course the price risk as well but with transaction fees soaring the onchain risk has gone up a considerable amount one exercise that we can do is take the percent difference between the total market cap of the entire asset class and the fair value logarithmic regression trend line which as we've said before is a monotonically increasing function the reason it's monotonic is because we assume that adoption is always taking place even though the the current valuation of the market cap of the asset class does not always reflect that because we go through periods of greed and fear and so it's important to remember that if you're an investor within the cryptoverse if you take a look at at the percent difference that you get a chart that looks like this and you can see that we've gone down to about 50 you know maybe a little less I mean about 50% undervalued or so um last cycle I mean if I just sort of draw the line across last cycle during the pandemic drop we went a little bit lower the cycle before that we were a little bit lower you can also see the highs from this last cycle were somewhat tempered compared to the prior highs even if you account for diminishing returns so the general idea and and I've said this before and I and I this was a prediction that I made in early 2023 was that for the entire year we will spend the entire year below the fair value logarithmic regression trend line the red line but above the lower green regression trend line so despite all the price action all the ups and the Downs mostly UPS honestly in 2023 the total market cap Still Remains below the fair value and above the lower regression trend line the lower regression trend line right now by the way is just south of 750 billion or so approximately 750 billion you can see previously when we when the total market cap was dropping back in late 2022 it went down to about 800 billion so the lower regression ban right now is actually still lower than where total market cap was in late 2022 but by the time we reach approximately halfway through the year the lower regression band will have met where we previously were in late 2022 in terms of where that lower regression band is so that's an important to an important distinction to remember now often times I don't go too much further in to these discussions within this video because I like to keep them somewhat succinct but this is also the first video of the year of 2024 I do want to show a couple of other charts just to get you know just to get us all thinking about where we are within the current market cycle I think there's two valid arguments to be made as to where we are within the market cycle and I would like to present both of them to you if you've watched this channel you should not be surprised by either of these two presentations but if you're new it might be useful to view the market in both of these ways so that we're not potentially caught off guard the first way is is the more bullish way the second way is the more bearish way the more bullish way just looks at Roi from cycle lows if you were to look at the ROI of from from bit of Bitcoin from bare Market year lows from late 2014 late 2018 and late 2022 I guess in 2014 was actually January 2015 you get a chart that looks like this and if you zoom in to the current market cycle this purple line it's basically right in between the orange line which is cycle 3 and the green green line which is cycle 4 so up until this point we haven't really deviated from what we've historically done it often seems like we have but we haven't right I mean this is this is what Bitcoin has historically done in Prior Cycles now there is a distinction though between the last two cycles in last cycle Bitcoin continued to Rally even at this point it did not get a cool off period of 3 to four months like it did in 2016 it just continued to and then we had the pandemic drop basically you know we got too overheated too early on in the cycle and then we had a pretty big drop now yes it was caused by the pandemic it's not like we can say hey that's going to happen again it it very well might not there are risks involved with the market we have an inverted yield curve I think it is important to consider that that is a risk considering that it has a pretty good track record it's also impossible to know when that's going to get resolved whether it gets resolved next month six months from now 12 months from now or longer we are we are entering the window or we have entered the window when it normally gets resolved around this time but we'll still have to wait and see just how much longer that's going to take if the market continues to climb for the next couple of weeks then it could signal a potential risk off period as we get further out into the first quarter of 2024 as the market will likely need to at least go through some type of cool off period if it stays relatively flat then it could just be a grind for several months without getting you know a larger dip so it kind of depends on on potentially what happens over the next few months with the potential spot ETF news I would say there's still a risk that the that the greed sticks around for a little bit longer and if Bitcoin does grind higher then it would potentially set us off for a larger pullback later in the first quarter there's another way to look at this as well wow okay this is the obvious way to look at the market and I think it's IR relevant way to look at it and I I think it's foolish to look at this and say that this time is different because so far it's not it really is not but there's another way that we can look at the chart that I I I feel like I I have to continue to show it mainly because if I don't show it and the market respects that view then I might wish that I had spent a little bit more time on it and it's the view that you're all familiar with but it essentially says that Bitcoin goes up until we get to the point where rate Cuts arrive and when you look when you think about rate Cuts we have to ask ourselves why did Bitcoin find a local high why don't we call it a a midcycle high why did Bitcoin find a midcycle high in 2019 now you might say well Ben that's because of the pandemic and you should not think about the pandemic as something that we need to be concerned about this cycle and I would agree with that however Bitcoin found this local high at which it did have a 50% correction before the pandemic was even a thing that I think was on any of our minds Bitcoin topped out right here and then fell over 50% by the end of 2019 okay this is a 50% drop and you'll notice again that the local high came in just before rate Cuts began now I think that's fascinating I wonder why that is well I think you could argue there's two arguments that I think come to mind for me one of which is that there is such a thing is you know the FED when they cut rates they're likely doing so because they think the economy is weak do we really think they were cutting rates in 2019 because the economy was strong probably not and so if they do cut rates in early 2024 it might be an admission by the Federal Reserve that the economy is kind of weak despite the headline numbers right you know there there there could be some softening up of the labor market and perhaps they would like to get ahead of that and so that might be why the midcycle top came in just before rate Cuts began another potential reason is that when rates are going higher you might argue that their counter that counterparty risk goes up a lot of zombie companies go under in Traditional Bank in the traditional financial sector and perhaps Bitcoin is a hedge against that and as you go back to lower interest rates uh perhaps at least a immediately that counterparty risk is no longer as big of a deal Bitcoin gets that puts in that midcycle top cooling off until QE returns and then going on on a larger Bull Run so I I I feel like I have to show this view because we have been following this view for a long time we've also been following this view as well and you could still have something where they both more or less play out like where you look back at this in two years you get some type of riskof environment that leads the FED to print something similar to what we saw last cycle and then Bitcoin goes on um you know it it continues to Rally so that is something that I I think we have to think about if you look at the total market cap of crypto one of the things that I've mentioned is that I think 10 trillion is a is a possibility uh in the future this is something that I've said I think since 2019 okay total market cap right now of crypto is 1. 652 trillion what's interesting is there are some things that line up here and and it's I don't know how much weight we should put into this because I often think that logarithmic regression models are better suited for cryptocurrency than just making a parallel Channel but for a moment let's suppose that a parallel Channel were the correct way to to sort of plot out potential price action for the total market cap of the cryptocurrency aside class if you take this high right here from late 2017 you'll actually notice that it connects the the the peak in in May of 2021 and the peak in November of 2021 quite well what's more interesting is if you if you pull this down to to the December 2018 low which notice is that it sort of connects here to the pandemic selloff at least at the weekly close there was a wick below it you can see there was a long Wick that went down but in terms of that scare that led the FED back to QE this is what happened right we got a big scare in the market QE returned and then the asset class rallied back up what's interesting what what's really interesting interesting is when you connect the dots when you connect this dot here to that dot and that dot and you extend it down to the 2018 low the 2019 midcycle High occurred right in the middle of that trend line right in the middle of that trend line you can see right here that the middle of that trend line was at about 380 something billion which is essentially where the total market cap of crypto topped out at that midcycle high which again coincidentally happens to correspond to when interest rates started to go back down so as much as I would like to not look at this view on the market because it's you know because I know it's it's not a popular view until it deviates I think it's relevant to follow I also think that this one is relevant to follow right if the model's not broke why do we try to fix it but I also look at it like like this and I I look at this and say well you know last cycle we hit this High here and then we hit the high again and then we hit the high again and then we hit this low and then we hit the low again right here at least on a weekly time frame with a wick below it just as the last rate cut arrived and then I look to the current cycle and say huh is it playing out in a similar manner where the potential not guaranteed but the potential midcycle top occurs at the midpoint which is where it occurred last cycle as well which by the way is also where interest rates started to go back down the market is currently suspecting that the First Rate cut might might arrive by March there's a chance it could happen in January there's a chance it could happen in May but currently Market expectations are that the First Rate cut arrives in March and so I do wonder if we are at all repeating what we saw last cycle with a potential cool off period sometime after putting in this midcycle top which again might correspond to approximately the first interest rate cut so that is something that is on my mind what's interesting is if you take the low from Total market cap and just draw a trend line across the screen you'll see that where we previously were finds the bottom of this channel by Q3 of this year by the third quarter of this year but you'll also notice that the trend line here would still be lower than the prior lows up until about that time now remember by this point it gets you to around 750 760 billion which by the way is not that different from where this lower logarithmic regression trend line is remember I said before it's currently at around it's it's currently between 7 to 800 billion and it would take until about halfway through the year for this logarithmic aggression trend line to be above the prior lows from late 2022 which is also kind of in agreement with this chart even though it's a completely different model and looking at a slightly shorter time frame because this model over here is fit to all data going back to 2010 this parallel channel is just looking at at the last couple of Cycles going back to late 2017 so I do wonder if if there is a risk if of the market playing out something like that where you get some type of midcycle top around the time that rate Cuts arrive and then by the time that you get to the last rate cut and real QE coming back in perhaps that's where we get another explosive move back up to the upside one interesting thing about this chart is you can put some price labels on it and you can see that's around 700 800 billion this one's around 100 billion maybe a little bit less 90 and then you have 2.5 trillion and 3 trillion so far we've gone down to about 750 billion okay the the low right now of this parallel Channel at this at the at the bottom of the channel would correspond to 574 billion but we're not right we're not there right now right and and the chances that we were to go to that level in the next week are are pretty small and so the long longer that it takes to ever go back to this channel assuming that we ever do the the higher that it would eventually go for instance by April that would actually be at 659 billion by November it would be at 841 billion which again is above the prior lows from late 2022 so it all depends on when it happens if it even does if it even does so just to throw a couple of numbers on the chart what's interesting is if you then come back up to the top of the channel by 2025 by the way let's just say April of 2025 which is when Bitcoin topped out last cycle that actually puts you at 10 trillion at at approximately $10 trillion now again I don't know if we're going to make it to 10 trillion this cycle or not I don't want to go into it deterministic um I I think there's a chance that we could but I also think that even if we do there there could be a period between now and then that leads the FED to print so far we know that the fed's main two mandates right we know that their main two mandates are price stability and maximum employment for the last couple of years the FED has raised interest rates very quickly higher for longer has been their has been their Mantra in order to bring inflation back down up until recently the labor market has been relatively resilient it hasn't really moved a whole lot in fact if you were to go take a look at the macro side of things if you look at the unemployment rate it is still relatively low I mean it's at 3.7% so far the labor market has not been an issue for the Federal Reserve the labor market has been very tight they've had really no choice but to raise rates to get back to price stability which would then theoretically lead us to another phase of economic expansion but I think there are some cracks starting to appear and that's why in the last fomc po came out and said that we should expect you know a few rate Cuts next year if you were to take a look at the number of job openings per unemployed worker you can see that it's actually coming down pretty quickly the reason it's not yet expressed in the unemployment rate is because for every unemployed worker there's 1.34 job openings so there's actually still more job openings than there currently are unemployed people the problem of course is the trend right the problem is the trend and back in April of 2023 this ratio was at 1.82 so it was essentially you know almost two job openings per unemployed worker that's dropped a lot now it's down to all the way you know all the way down to 1.34 the issue of course is over the next 6 months if the FED does not cut aggressively there's a good chance that this metric could continue to drop to the point where there's no longer enough job openings for every unemployed worker which would sort of represent the idea that the FED has achieved their their their goal of loosening up the labor market and getting rid of all that excess right you can see that the pre-pandemic trend there was only about one job opening per unemployed worker which was not bad I mean like that was not a bad time for the labor market it was about one job opening per per per unemployed worker you can see that it dropped down a lot but then then they overshot it right and now we've been paying the consequences with higher inflation for the last couple of years and so this continues to come down and I think that the FED sees these sorts of metrics right they see things like contined\n",

      "trend there was only about one job opening per unemployed worker which was not bad I mean like that was not a bad time for the labor market it was about one job opening per per per unemployed worker you can see that it dropped down a lot but then then they overshot it right and now we've been paying the consequences with higher inflation for the last couple of years and so this continues to come down and I think that the FED sees these sorts of metrics right they see things like contined claims versus the unemployment rate and and they know that continued claims as they go up it can lead the unemployment rate as we can see right like it's not this is something we've historically seen as continued claims go up normally the unemployment rate starts to go higher not in a linear fashion it is a stochastic process and all prior business Cycles were a stochastic process where the unemployment rate would start to Trend up and then maybe pull back for a couple of months and then continue higher so there are risks in the labor market um and I do think the FED has identified those risks and that's why they've advertised three rate Cuts in 2024 and I think that they do need to cut rates in 2024 in order to get fully ahead of all the lag effects from all the interest rate hikes remember we were near 0% a couple years ago and now the FED funds rate is at 5 a half per. so when we think about charts like this one over here when we think about Roi after the bare Market gear low we can see that it still lines up and if we only looked at last cycle or sorry two cycles ago it would look pretty okay I mean like it it hasn't really deviated from that cycle at all but last cycle shows us there are always risks involved right if last cycle taught me anything it's that we should not get ahead of ourselves we should not assume that there can't be pullbacks because there can be and I know I know it seems like you know I know with price action recently there's been a lot of you know a lot of upward momentum and and it and it certainly seems like that kind of stuff can't happen to some people but uh it can and it doesn't mean that it will and I know that you know I I get some Flack for pointing out the downside RIS quite a bit but I don't want to ever stop pointing it out I want people to at least understand what it is I'm not saying like you know don't be an investor in an asset class that you love what I'm saying is that there's a risk involved the way that I navigate the cryptoverse and the way that I've navigated it for the last couple of years is to keep my portfolio mostly just Bitcoin and missed out on some pretty epic gains in the altcoin market because I chose to do that I also argue that I've minimized some of my losses especially in 2022 and a lot and for a lot of altcoins in 2023 just by following the Bitcoin dominance Trend but that is something that I think is worthwhile to consider is the idea that you know we can look at it like this Roi from this low we can also look at it like this which is do we get a mid cycle top around the time that interest rates begin to be cut and if that does happen does it tag this trend line sort of the middle part of the trend line just like it did last cycle last cycle that midcycle top came in the summer of the prehab Year this cycle we've already gone a lot higher than where we were in the summer of the prehab year but again we also haven't had rate Cuts yet which we were starting to get by the midpoint of the prehab year in 2019 so this is an important way I think to look at the cryptoverse and it kind of gives you two ways of viewing where we potentially are within the market cycle if you think we're more based on monetary policy if you think the the the the the the cryptoverse more depends on monetary policy then I imagine this would be more interesting to you if you think that it exists outside of monetary policy and that it's just details that we don't need to worry about out then you're probably more comfortable just looking at charts like this and saying yeah you know there can be moves to the downside just like there were last cycle but the general direction has you know has still trended upwards from this point in the cycle even though there was a pretty big selloff in the last cycle so a lot of different ways to view the current market cycle if you want to even call it a market cycle a lot of people think there aren't even such things as a market cycle which I can respect that view too I mean you know while while I think a lot of us sort of look at at the at the cycles and say well this peak occurred in late 2013 this was late 2017 most metrics really do say that this was the top and that this while technically a higher price wasn't really supported by anything else but at the end of the day price action is king So I mean to hell with the indicators if price goes higher price goes higher right I mean who cares if the indicator didn't say that it was going to another way to look at the market that could give more Credence to the idea of where of of the process of finding some type of midcycle top could be the social risk right so if you were to go look at the social risk what you'll see is that in in May of 2019 it actually went up to about3 risk and then had a pretty big drop to below 0.2 risk which is actually what just happened right it just went to above3 risk and then it just dropped down to less than 0.2 risk and that actually marked the high for social risk for a little while you can see that it did go back up after this High here did not even correspond to the high in bitcoin price bitcoin's price actually went a little bit higher and the social risk put in a lower high right around the time that rate Cuts began and so if Bitcoin were to get another move to the upside going into a potential spot ETF then I would say let's keep an eye on on this trend line right here let's keep an eye out on that trend line and what's fascinating about this this trend line this blue line that goes to the middle of the page is that it's essentially right at two trillion right at 2 trillion you can see it's like right here by February the first week of February it would correspond to approximately $2 trillion which is also interesting the reason why $2 trillion is interesting is if you look at where it topped out last cycle it topped out just below that dead cap bounce that occurred in the first half of the bare Market year this area right here that 2 trillion would correspond to just below this dead cap Bounce from the same from that same prior cycle so just something to think about um and again I don't know if bitcoin's going to push higher into the spot ETF if the spot ETF is rejected then I imagine that would be a very big surprise to the market and and you know the market would likely sell off in the short term if if news came out that the spot ETF were rejected if the spot ETF were accepted uh then then perhaps you you go into this process of of putting in a a midcycle top one other aspect to bitcoin that I think is important is ethereum I think ethereum is fascinating to understand where Bitcoin is within its Market cycle and the reason why I say that is if you look if you think about the market if you think about like the the cryptoverse in terms of liquidity the the the place in the cryptoverse that has a lot of liquidity besides Bitcoin is ethereum and what's fascinating to me is that this is playing out in an almost identical manner not in terms about the time it took to get to you know to this level but take a look at it like this just just look at this for for one minute and and I I think ethereum can give us some insight into potentially where we are if you look at this low right here and you go across the screen you'll see that I'm going to shift this up just to sort of connect to these to these points right here and what you'll see is we put in a low and then the ethereum Bitcoin valuation sort of flirted with that low for a long time before it eventually broke down it eventually broke down and what's fascinating to me is that when it broke down from this Wick it broke down after 83 weeks so the initial Wick took 83 weeks to durably break below now let's do the same process this cycle you can see that there's this initial Wick down here and then the ethereum Bitcoin valuation keeps you know trying to go below it but it hasn't done so so far and and seasonality now that we're in the early part of the Year isn't as bad for ethereum as it is in the last part of the prehab Year be that as it may if you take a a a time like a a range here from this low here and you were to go out say 80 83 weeks it would put you the week of January 15th the week of January 15th and so I really do wonder and again like I I think we're going to know very very soon if this is the correct way to view the market or if it's not I think we should know very very soon we've been following this forever I would feel remiss if I didn't follow through with it especially considering where the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is right now if there is some type of Bitcoin move over the next two weeks as we get into the spot ETF news finally breaking and if Bitcoin were to break up and go to sort of the trend line here which might Mark a midcycle top and if it breaks ether Bitcoin down off of this this trend line which it also broke over here what you'll be interested to know is that when the ethereum Bitcoin valuation finally broke last cycle it also corresponded to when interest rates started to come back down so you'll see right here that the breakdown of ether Bitcoin occurred right before rate Cuts arrived and we're likely about we're we're on the verge of rate Cuts again probably within the next two to three month two to four months we're probably going to get rate Cuts so I do wonder I'm not I'm not discounting the you know a a potential um I'm not I'm certainly not discounting ethereum Bitcoin from bouncing I mean even even back over here it got it got several bounces before it it finally broke down and so I'm I'm I'm aware that a bounce Could Happen by the ethereum Bitcoin valuation and if it did I would still keep keep my eyes on the bull market sport band you know which is currently at around 0056 to 057 right but it does seem like monetary policy is at least relevant to follow considering that ether Bitcoin broke down just before rate Cuts arrived considering that total market cap found a local high before cooling off for a period just before rate Cuts arrived and considering that when you look at last cycle there was a an accelerated move going into the next two weeks we're currently on day 416 uh or sorry 417 of the cycle last cycle Bitcoin found a local high about 10 days from now before going risk off for a few weeks again it was a higher low right it was a higher low but that is something that at least at least did happen so I will continue to follow this model here the basically the model that that looks at this larger Channel potential midcycle top at around the same time that interest rates begin to be cut we'll take a look at the ethereum Bitcoin valuation as it continues to be really between a rock and a hard place you know the the bull market support band is squeezing it down but it also is is fighting to stay above this trend line here perhaps the spot ETF or or the having will be enough to to knock ether Bitcoin down if it's going to and if it doesn't then then we're deviating from the prior cycle and then also to think about the social risk is it you know are we going into a period like this is where we you know while while some momentum has come back in terms of sentiment it still doesn't go all the way back up to the higher risk bands right because you have to have I mean to get back up there it takes a lot right I mean you think about all the price action that we've seen and there's still a lot there's a lot of people that haven't returned go look at YouTube views go look at YouTube views doesn't really look that different from what we've seen I mean in fact if you were to look at a 30-day moving average the number of YouTube views for these these YouTube channels including my own it still is a lower high right there still haven't been a lot of people that have come back even though Bitcoin has exploded this much to the upside how do we get people to come back how do you get people to come back to the cryptoverse if higher prices haven't done it well one thing would be if Bitcoin were to break to a new all-time high that would probably bring a lot of people back but the Counterpoint also is that the way you bring people back is you go back to looser monetary policy where people feel like they can actually start speculating on higher risk Investments again I know there's a lot of people watching this Channel right now that are like well what do you think we've been doing for the last 2 years right but you also have to remember that right now these channels right here are averaging you know 6 to 700,000 views a day but at the peak of the bull market these channels were averaging over 2 million views a day so while you might be looking at this and thinking like well we've been speculating dubiously for the last two years there are a lot of people that have left I mean you can see it right you can see YouTube views you can see just how far down they've gone and I do think eventually people will return I just wonder if in order for them to return do we need to get back to quantitative easing I would think so I would think so I think QE would likely need to come back um and I think that the way QE comes back is you get some obvious softening up of the labor market that gives the Federal Reserve an EXC excuse to start printing and if they start printing aggressively that's when risk assets go back up and perhaps that's when we'll finally reach our 10 trillion dollar but even if we do go to 10 trillion it's still several years away and as I said before well likely several years away I guess it could happen anytime I mean these models are are of course all models are wrong some are useful right um but I'm still I'm still thinking that there's is going to be a period at some point likely this year where the yield curve un inverts and we have to deal with the Fallout of that right the the uninversity that is forcing them to do so they're seeing something that makes them want to cut and they've already advertised that we're likely going to get rate Cuts here on the next few months and then we'll see how the market responds and if the market responds negatively then that would likely bring back quantitative easing and if quantitating if quantitative easing comes back then that would likely bring back these speculators back to the cryptoverse um because monetary policy isn't as tight as it has been for the last you know year and a half or two years or so but this whole exercise that we you know these these beauty of mathematics videos the whole point is to to just give you that that thousand foot view right to say look the market the asset class has been undervalued since June of 2022 and despite that it could become more undervalued at some point I mean like we've we've basically just been in this range for a long time and and maybe we'll continue to be in it in this cycle over here we dropped below this in January 2015 we didn't durably get back above it until 2 and a half years later if you were to if if this cycle were to emulate that two and a half years later for this cycle would correspond to basically the the the beginning of 2025 to durably get back above it if it were to play out like the 2016 cycle which is still another year away so we'll see if that happens I do hope you guys enjoy the content I I do hope these the the beauty of mathematics Series has been useful to you in naviga the cryptoverse trying to tune out the noise and just showing that the asset class does go up as a function of time there are risks that we have to consider and and failure to consider those risks could be detrimental if you if you consider the risk and you invest anyways and the market goes up hey you took off you took on the risk and it paid off congratulations if you don't take on the risk and the market goes up then you didn't take on the risk right so we'll see over the next year if we do get some type of of of larger pullback like we did in the last couple of Cycles or not and we'll see if that midcycle top comes into play or if we just blast through it I do think it's important to have invalidation criteria I mean I I don't want to just put out a model like this and then just not talk about it in the future but I would say that if the total market cap blasts past two trillion then it's it's deviating from what happened over here okay because over here it it went up to the midpoint of the channel and then it got a larger pullback and so we'll see if that happens again or not and if it does happen I mean if there if if Bitcoin were to Rally up and and and lift the asset class higher again then then I I would I would just look towards that $2 trillion milone and by the way $2 trillion from this level it's still it's about 20% higher than we currently are and what's interesting is if you zoom in we actually already tagged it back in August 2022 I mean you can see we came back down and we bounc right up to that trend line which is where we are not too far away from right now so I will continue to look at the market through the lens of monetary policy I will continue to look at the market through the lens of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation and through the social metrics and through the ROI high from the cycle lows at least the bare Market low the low from the bare Market year we'll look at it throughout all these different ways and hopefully it can help some of you guys navigate the crypto if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video thumbs up but again check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom links in the description below I still do think that the market cap of crypto will eventually go to 10 trillion uh probably within the next few years um plus or minus a few trillion as we go to sleep at night we cannot help but wonder what's a few trillion dollars among friends\n",

      "    hey everyone thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the onchain risk if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse docomo ah and jump in so onchain analysis often gets a bad reputation because a lot of onchain analysis can often be used to sort of paint a more Rosy picture at highs than you know than it really is right because you know it might say well look at all these people flooding in that's a good thing but often times that can Mark tops um and so I thought and we've talked about this before you know we have different risk metrics we have the price risk the social risk and the onchain risk and the onchain risk is interesting because it includes a lot of different things we're including the mvrv zcore the PE multiple the mvrv risk the M the the minor cap to Thermo cap the market cap to Thermo cap uh transaction fees terminal price risk the um the r hodle Ratio or R hotal ratio and there's Supply and profit risk so these two I'm not actually including right now you can see that those are turned off we could include those but the idea is that you take each metric you normalize prior prior results between 0 and one prior movements between 0 and one and rather than you know interpreting the rather than interpreting it how we might want to interpret it based on what we think's going to happen we just interpret it based on hey this is historically what has happened and therefore we're either at a high risk level or a low risk level and if you were to look at individual risk scores right so like if you were to look at the mbrb zcore risk that's where it currently is it is you know just below 04 if you look at the P multiple risk it's getting pretty high it's at 716 note that normally once it gets above 7 it doesn't stay there for very long maybe a few months at most so there's some warning signs there if you look at the mbrv mbrv risk it's getting relatively High um this one is is is that the minor cap thermal cap is is just below 04 you can see that in 2019 it went all the way up to 0.5 um you have transaction fees risk which is basically at one it's really really high right now um we just put out a video on transaction fees talking about that the risk on transaction fees is really high suggesting that you know the market needs to cool off at some point in the next few weeks you have the market cap to thermocap risk which is still relatively low compared to the other ones and then you have the terminal price risk which is just below 0.5 note that in in um you know in 2019 we had a cool off period after it went just above 6 and in 2016 we had a cool off period after it just went above 0.5 and then we have the the our hotle ratio risk which is still relatively low and the supply and profit risk which is actually relatively high right it's all the way up here at 08 risk so some of these are getting more elevated than others um but the nice thing is that you can show all of them and combine them into a single one called the total onchain risk and when you do that you get this chart so the total onchain risk right now is 0.55 now how do you use this well if you like the onchain stuff then you can say all right well if it's a low risk level I'll buy into the market if it's a high risk level I'll sell right so if it's between say 0 to 04 maybe you buy if it's if it's between 04 to 6 maybe you don't do anything and if it's above 6 maybe you sell or maybe you're more aggressive and maybe you buy all the way up to0 6 risk and then you start selling at 08 or maybe you're super conservative and you only buy below 02 risk meaning you only buy every few years and then you just sit on your hands for a while which probably isn't the worst strategy right um so this is an interesting risk metric to use because whenever it goes to low risk it's generally a good time to buy whenever goes to high risk it's really good time to sell the problem is that it doesn't always go to the higher risk band right like here's an example in 2019 where we sort of faded after going up to about 6 risk right you can see it it topped out at 6 risk essentially Point like 602 risk right now it's at 055 risk so it is getting relatively elevated and um important to keep an eye on it because if it to go up even higher um the thing to remember with the onchain risk is that when it's at a relatively high level let's say above 6 it doesn't tend to stay there for more than a few months right so I would I would certainly want to keep an eye on this as as the market continues to especially the onchain stuff you know has continue to get heated you know the price of Bitcoin hasn't moved up uh as much as some of the risk metrics would have you believe right like the the transaction fee risk has moved up a lot because transaction fees are soaring right now um and you know it's all the way at at a really high risk level that actually corresponds to Prior major tops but then you look at other risk levels like the mvz score and it's nowhere near that and so it's hard to know which one you should wait more but if you wait them all the same you get something looks like this now maybe you're someone that thinks that the transaction fee risk shouldn't be used because of ordinals or something and you can turn that off and see that it reduces the onchain risk down to about 0469 um perhaps you think it should be considered but maybe only consider it half as much as all the other ones so you include a little bit of it and maybe you want to turn on Supply and profit risk all the way up to see where that puts things so this is a way that you can kind of identify what is the risk in the market and the great thing about it is that you not it doesn't really matter what you think about what it has to do or what you think it has to do or you know what you you know what you're convinced that it's going to do because of something you read but it's just say no you know there's there's just a risk level and it's either at a low risk level or it's at a high risk level and if it's at a low risk that means you might want to you know based on historical results no guarantee of future returns but historically it's been a good idea to DCA in at low risk historically it's been a good idea to DCA at high risk and again as we said with the other risk metrics that we talked about not too long ago it doesn't have to be any more complicated than that right that's my strategy it always has been it always will be at least that's my plan I DCA in Bitcoin when the risk level is low when the risk level is High I take profits and I don't make it any more complicated than that of course we make videos talking about potentially where price action could go in the short term which admittedly is often wrong but I don't trade any of that stuff right I don't I never have I never I don't really plan on ever doing it I just trade when it goes to a high risk level I take some profits a low risk level I I get into the market and that's the way I navigate crypto it's also something that allows me to sleep well at night because rather than constantly predict what I think has to happen and navigating my portfolio based around what I think's going to happen I just react right if the price goes up to higher risk levels I sell if it goes lower to lower risk levels I buy I react to What happens rather than spend a lot of time thinking about what has to happen because of what suits my bias okay that's way I navigate crypto that's the way I navigate Bitcoin we have dozens of risk Metric videos on this channel over the last four years it all say basically the same thing um in terms of how I navigate crypto again this risk metric you can find via the website at intothe cryptoverse ccom we are running the sale on it right now make sure you guys check that out um you can lock in that rate as long as you not cancel and get access to the onchain risk thank you guys for

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be looking at the percentage draw down from the all-time high if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom where you can of course access this chart but also the same chart for a lot of different cryptocurrencies as well as um stocks Commodities indices Etc so we're going to keep this one relatively short and sweet I just think that looking at at the percent draw down from the all-time high is useful for Bitcoin sort of get an idea of of where we are with respect to the the Mania phase from the prior cycle you can see generally speaking I mean the first cycle we went all the way down to about 93% down um and then the the cycle after that you know on The Daily time frame it was only about 82% down but it was it was actually a bit more than that U maybe about 86 or 87% I think when you you look at at Wix and whatnot very similar um this cycle over here and then of course so far we've seen it go down about 75% or so but again on a on a on a wick it was actually all the way down to 77% when you compare the highs um from 2021 but interestingly enough I what you'll notice in in both of these prior moves is you'll sort of see a spike at some point um and it'd be interesting to know if if we're sort of forming one of those again um sort of in route because one of the things you'll notice here in 2015 is there was a spike all the way up to - 32% so only only down about 32% from the highs before we had a a a cool off period that lasted you know a couple of months or so and then over here we had a likee all the way up to about 30 34% down and then and then of course we went into a cool down phase for actually in that case it was about 9 months so you have 32% down and then 34% down and right now you can actually see we're about 38% down um and the the the closest it got I suppose was right here at around 34 to 35% down so so this might be an interesting thing to sort of continue to watch in the coming months to see if if it's just sort of forming a spike into the spot ETF where it gets you know a decent way back to that you know those those prior levels but it doesn't quite make it there only for it to then go to go into a cool off period for a few months because you can see it it really happen both cycles and of course it it's hard to see the spike um when you're in it but again same thing you know same thing kind of over here and 2019 was was interesting because you know Bitcoin had a a very significant rally just before rate Cuts arrived and and you know for those following what the Federal Reserve is doing they're likely going to start cutting rates next year and so it makes you wonder if we're sort of setting up for a very similar outcome again um especially going into sort of the spot ETF hype that that might be coming at the beginning of of January so something to keep an eye on um just the percent draw down from the all-time high for Bitcoin you can also view it for for other things as well I mean just for reference here's what it looks like for the total market cap not nearly as impressive um you know total market cap of crypto it's still down about 45.5% from the highs if you were to look at it for ethereum it's actually down about 53.87 from the highs so you know I know I've heard a lot of people say that that ethereum is is holding up well over the last couple of years against Bitcoin but it is notable and you know and we've talked before about how The Ether Bitcoin pair has been putting in lower highs since the merge it is notice notable that ethereum is down about 54% from the highs whereas Bitcoin is down about 38% from the highs so you know this is again is is proof that Bitcoin has been holding stronger than ethereum since those highs from from 2021 so again looking at it with ethereum this is what it looks like right and and and the lows that we've previously seen in terms of the draw down so far it's about 79% um when you're not including the Wicks and then over here was about 94% or so but anyways we'll go ahead and wrap it up there again I I said we're going to keep this one short and sweet maybe the last thing we'll do is apply moving average to it and and it might might help visualize some of this stuff so if you look at like a 30-day SMA of the % draw down from the highs uh you'll see that in 2016 we sort of went up to about 40% down in terms of a a a 30-day moving average 2019 it was about you know 43% down or so and right now we're actually sitting around 40% down so interesting times uh that we're currently in and and we'll see if you know we'll see if there's a coold down period in bitcoin price action sometime you know especially as we get into after the the retical spotf news whether it you know whether it sort of finalizes or not in in January anyways if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptus premium at intothe crypto.com link is in the description below we do have several tiers available and of course you can get access to this chart as well as a lot of the other charts that we talk about in the videos thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe and I'll see you next time bye\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the computer verse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin but more specifically we're going to discuss the Bitcoin dominance if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptographers premium uh into the cryptiverse.com let's go ahead and jump in now as you guys know I'm a big proponent of this of the Bitcoin dominance going up during this stage of the cycle about a year and a half ago I said I'm just going to Simply put on my Bitcoin Maxi hat and just wait this process out because I've recognized it in the past and I've seen what can happen throughout the bear Market year and the pre-halving year and just sort of recognizing the idea that the dominant should go up a lot to the detriment of the altcoin market of course on both their USD Pairs and their Bitcoin pairs I have maintained for quite some time that the Bitcoin dominance is the key to unlocking the secrets of the cryptographers there are of course a lot of people out there that will say things like the Bitcoin dominance is is not a worthwhile metric to follow but I also would say a lot of those people that discount its importance would have also likely been telling you to buy all coins for the last 18 months right now just simply looking at the dominance could have told you long ago that the altcoin market generally speaking was not worth the risk when compared to Bitcoin now I do need to note a couple of things here first of all there are always all coins that outperform some there's always a few right so any given cycle you could go back and say well what about this all coin or that altcoin or you could look at new altcoins being being you know pushed out and oftentimes you'll find that you know some of these really low market cap coins can go up in the short term and maybe outperform Bitcoin but when we talk about the dominance we're talking about the collective altcoin market so more or less total three this one so the idea is for every dollar you put into the cryptoverse you want to ideally make sure that you are maximizing your risk-adjusted returns or your sharp ratio that is the idea and if you're putting a dollar into the collective altcoin market and the collective altcoin Market is going down against Bitcoin then essentially what you're doing is you're taking on more risk for Less reward right that's essentially what you're doing because it's not to say that all coins can't go up if Bitcoin goes up it's to say that if if all coins do go up it's likely because Bitcoin went up a lot more and if Bitcoin goes down then the altcoin market gets crushed if you remember from you know the last Bitcoin dominance video we did we said one of two things we said all right guys we there's two scenarios right that are worthwhile to consider with with Bitcoin USD and how it relates to the Bitcoin Domino's only two scenarios right we either Hold the Line or we don't and in both cases the dominant should go up right if Bitcoin holds the line then we saw what happened over here in March right so if you overlay Bitcoin dominance onto this chart you can see that in March the dominant shot up win Bitcoin held the line at the bull market support ban so he said look If We Hold the Line again the dominance is just going to go up again more than likely I mean there's no guarantee but it seems like the most likely outcome is for the Bitcoin dominance to go up if Bitcoin USD holds the line for the second time in a row furthermore we said that if we get weekly closes below the 20 week estimate that the Bitcoin dominance should also go up it's interesting because we got a bit of both you can see if you zoom in here we actually had a weekly close below the 20-week SMA however we stayed above the 21 week EMA again it's a bull market support banned it consists of two moving averages and as long as they're holding between them right you don't have to hold you know both of them necessarily simultaneously there's plenty of periods where you might hold one and and and not the other right so as long as you're holding it we can go up or the dominance can go up but the weekly close below the 20 week SMA if you are watching closely you will note that there was a fundamental shift in how the altcoin market was behaving on that Weekly close below the 20 week SMA right so if you take a closer look at that if we for instance overlay the ethereum Bitcoin evaluation right which is what we're going to do and we'll we'll look at this week here you can see that ether Bitcoin started to plummet when Bitcoin had a weekly close below its 20 week estimate it started to plummet it's interesting and actually there's there's an even better way to look at this I think um and that's to look at the relationship of Bitcoin USD on a daily time frame with The Ether Bitcoin valuation and actually I think what I want what I really want to look at is is maybe um I'm trying to think of the best way to show this because what we saw really what we saw was maybe if I if I look at one divided by Bitcoin that'll show up yeah so here you go so what you'll see here is that as Bitcoin right so this again this is one divided by Bitcoin not the price of Bitcoin it's one divided by it so you can see that it it was tracking the ethereum Bitcoin valuation quite well right so if if Bitcoin went up meaning on this chart if it goes down then the ethereum Bitcoin valuation was going down right but also you can see here right Bitcoin USD was going down because it was going up on the chart right so it was going down ether Bitcoin was going up until when until early June why did it change here you can see if you look closely you can see that ether Bitcoin started to roll over before Bitcoin had its rally right it's as clear as day ether Bitcoin rolled over before the rally by Bitcoin USD started so look closely and let's just take a a date range here so ether Bitcoin topped about 10 days before Bitcoin USD found its low what happened you know what happened in early June I'm glad you asked right well you you should know at this point it was in fact when Bitcoin failed to hold the 20-week moving average right early June so ether Bitcoin rolled over so so Bitcoin was going down ether Bitcoin was going up why because Bitcoin was above its 20-week moving average however we know that ether Bitcoin started to go down before Bitcoin found its low before the rally happened why because Bitcoin is below the 20 week SMA okay so it goes back to this idea that we've talked about forever during you know during the the prehabbing year generally speaking and that is in fact that if Bitcoin bounces off the bull market support band then the dominance goes up right if it bounces the dominance generally goes up pretty clear pretty clear and obvious again just overlay the Bitcoin dominance onto the chart if it bounces off the 20 week the dominance goes up if it's in a slow downtrend like this then what happens as long as it's about the 20 week the dominance consolidates right so if you look here if we draw this out right when Bitcoin USD is sort of in this range where it sort of consolidating so too does the Bitcoin dominance consolidation so two does the Bitcoin dominance you get a breakout basically just back to the prior Range High the last time the last time Bitcoin was at 31k the dominance was only at 48 now we're at 31k and the dominant says that almost 52 percent what you're witnessing right now is a rotation of capital from higher risk assets like all coins to lower risk assets like Bitcoin some of those some of that rotation from alts is going into ethereum but ethereum is still bleeding to bitcoin if you go back to the bull market we did whole videos on how a lot of things bleed to eth and that is still true a lot of altcoins are still bleeding to eat you know don't take my word for it just go take a look I mean we we tracked it we track the all ether pairs occasionally as well look at Ada eth you know I mean it it's just been it's been moving down for a long time let me remove all this and try to clean this up a little bit so you can see what I'm talking about right so this is the Ada ether the a to Ether valuation right it's been bleeding for a long time it'll probably get some type of mean reversion at some point look at Ave right I mean it's pumped up a little bit here recently but still it's been a bleeder avax eth has been a bleeder right Dot eth a bleeder b and b e a double top into a bleeder link eth still been a bleeder okay so what you've witnessed is a rotation from the altcoin market to the Blue Chips now I think ethereum is a blue chip but I also think ethereum is bleeding to bitcoin which is why I don't call out the odd ether bleed as much as the Bitcoin bleed again it's because the ether Bitcoin valuation is also bleeding so why why Focus so much on alts bleeding to Ether if if eth is bleeding to bitcoin Bitcoin is inherently a lower risk option and you know this view that I've had on The Ether Bitcoin valuation has been one of the most polarizing views I think um so many people just continue to say while you know ethereum is is holding up strong and I say well and they'll say the tokenomics and whatnot and I mean I agree the tokenomics have changed but you know what the market took that into consideration here at the merge which was a lower high and it's just been one lower high ever since and every single time the ethereum Bitcoin valuation gets a rally you know I have to go to defend this thesis on Twitter uh because everyone starts to come out and and say all sorts of stuff but in the end this has just been a series of lower highs it's also been a series of lower lows okay so I still maintain that the collapse of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation will continue to act as a Tailwind for the Bitcoin dominance for months to come okay for months to come this is what I think I I think that the collapse of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation will lead the Bitcoin dominance much higher if you look by the way at the trend from the last cycle on ethereum's bitcoin valuation you can look at it however you want to you can look at it 2018 or 2019 and you'll see I mean here's one Trend right you get your first move up uh just kind of like over here let me look at this on the on the monthly time frame so it's a little bit cleaner right you still get your first move up your first distribution your second distribution um and then it and then it sort of slowly bleeds for a while and then it it comes back down and note that I think that this here it could sort of be like this right here so this could be one this here could be two right if it comes down here that could be two and maybe then it bounces rolls over and then goes into sort of three which is potentially where it could find a a macro bottom right and I don't really know how I feel about this I don't I you know I'm being honest right I don't know if this is um you know if this is trying to increase on some type of logarithmic growth curve where it's going to come back down to the 0.03 to 0.04 range and then try to build a base off of that and then go higher or if it's or it could also be um you know an oscillator right where it initially gets capitalized and then it just sort of oscillates between um between a range right so it kind of goes up and then it comes down and then it goes up and it goes down right there's a chance that that's the case but the point right the main point here is that the dominance should go higher now a lot of people say well how do you make money on the Bitcoin dollars well the first thing I will say is is by looking at the dominance I would have told you a year and a half ago that the altcoin market is not worth the risk okay it's just simply not and it's not again it's not to say that none of them can't go up it's just to say that collectively Bitcoin is a safer play anytime I see this on Twitter I get a thousand people saying what about XL coin or why all coin or Z altcoin yes you can always cherry pick a few micro caps that have outperformed but when you're talking about the collective altcoin Market you should understand what I mean look at a historical Snapshot from April 16th where Bitcoin was at 30k which is basically where it is today bitcoin's a little bit higher today in fact right so it's a it's at 30.7 here was it at 30.3 look at where ethereum was 2120 where is ethereum today 1882. where was cardano back then 45 cents where is it today 28 cents where was polygon Matic 118. where is it today 67 cents Solana 25 where is Solana today 16 dollars the list can go on and on right Dogecoin nine cents where is it today six and a half cents Litecoin a hundred dollars whereas Litecoin today 88 dollars now there might be a few exceptions um but there's not many xrp 52 cents where is xrp today 48 cents even though bitcoin's higher right xrp went down just like a lot of these all coins went down so I mean you really have to ask yourself right like you know you have to think about this right you have to think about opportunity costs every dollar you put into the crypto verse if you're putting in all these all coins you're essentially just watching them bleed back to the king back to Bitcoin now a lot of times people say well you know what if Bitcoin goes down then what's the what's the point that is the point it's that eventually Bitcoin likely will go back down and and then there's just simply nowhere for the all clean Market to hide because they've already been crushed on their Bitcoin pairs they don't have any support levels to hold anymore on their Bitcoin pairs because they lost their support levels during the Bitcoin USD rally on their Bitcoin pairs take a look at them you know we can go through them look at um at Ada Bitcoin I mean look at where it was exactly four years ago the same level in June 900 satoshi's guess where it was by by Late July 400 satoshi's the talk came in June in 2019 and and actually I think it would have happened around this time um I'm just saying right A lot of these just continue I mean every time I plot these out they just drop lower more or less the next time I look at them link Bitcoin fell below support we said it's likely going to follow Ave Bitcoin and go below its summer low and now it has uni Bitcoin probably gonna take out its summer low from 2022 as well Litecoin Bitcoin even though it's it's having year typically the rally sort of falters sometime by June or July um I wasn't taking my word for it uh let's just pull it up so Litecoin USD um so the yellow lines Mark the havings and normally you can see that the rally by Litecoin phase before the rep before the having actually arrives so just a fair warning okay you can see that in 2015 it peaked in July in 2019 it peaked in in mid-june right now we're in late June so we're getting to that around we're getting near that time where you would expect it for it to fade into the having it's possible that it could push higher but um you know we're in terms of time it's running at a time because once we get close to the having within a few weeks of it Litecoin typically Fades going into it okay so really it's no surprise that even in its having year the Litecoin Bitcoin valuation is still bleeding right I mean it was recently rejected off of its bull Mark scorpion again you know look at look at Solana Bitcoin this is one I've talked about forever about how this pattern emerges this pattern emerges where it goes to a low it rallies back up to the bull market support band only to take out the prior low and put in a new low and every single time it rallies everyone says you know it's going to the Moon right or wherever only for it to get rejected by the 20-week SMA again and to take out that prior low and to put in a new low right and it's just been doing the same thing again it's now gone below this I mean we did put a new low end over here on a wick that was lower than where we are right now but we're putting in weekly closes below where this weekly close was back over here so the same thing's playing out you know and and by the way if you go back and look at at things like Ada Bitcoin and you look at it on a monthly basis you know I've been and I've talked about ADA USD I mean I was I was on my channel of videos where I was buying it at like two cents back in 2019 2020. I was saying this is uh you know and then it went to three dollars but it doesn't mean that you have to marry the altcoin for the duration of its bear Market against Bitcoin you don't right you can think that a project could do well in a bull market in a secular bull market and think that it it has the ability to do well in a bull market scenario but also say you know what if if the macro conditions are are changing then some of these projects that once we're doing quite well can fall against Bitcoin for two years Ada Bitcoin is down 33 this month alone okay I mean you know I've I've gotten into arguments with people on Twitter about this one too and and every single month they say that it's done bleeding and again 33 down this month alone against Bitcoin dot Bitcoin is down for 15 this month alone Solana Bitcoin is down 29 this month alone BNB Bitcoin is down 31 in June this month how do you how do you quantify this for the collective altcoin Market I'm glad you asked right you take total three and you divide it by the Bitcoin market cap at best it's an oscillator at best it's not Slater you go up and you come down and you go up and when you're up here knowing everything's you're gonna break back down but guess what we tend to break back down and when we likely come back down here maybe by you know Q3 Q4 of this year right maybe a little bit later but we can move down pretty quickly I mean you can see that we were at this level in May of 2019 and we reached these lows by August and the the high for Bitcoin came in June so total three continued to bleed against Bitcoin even once the 2019 high was in for Bitcoin again total three is collectively down 17 against Bitcoin this month alone right this month alone if you want to throw ethereum into the mix and look at total two divided by Bitcoin you will in fact see that it is Fallen below support we are now at levels we have not been at since April of 2021. the Bitcoin rally purpose is to break the collective altcoin market off of their Bitcoin support levels so that when Bitcoin USD corrects the altcoin market has nowhere to hide if you looked at the Bitcoin dominance 18 months ago and just note it to yourself hey this dominance is pretty low it's probably going to go up for two years like it did over here if you just noted that and ignored all the gurus telling you about all these altcoins and and whatnot if you just ignored all of it and said you know what dominance is likely going to rally for two years you have been much better off right you would have been much better off had you just done that because the dominance continues to rally and every single time I put out a tweet about it or make a video about it you know there's there's all sorts of people saying that well this is going to be the top and every single time it proves them wrong if you look at at sort of the daily time frame on the Bitcoin dominance you will see that has been bouncing off the 100 day we talked about this on Twitter in fact you know I put out a tweet on Twitter when we were at this point saying that we were likely about to bounce whether Bitcoin held the line or not and that's the point right it's not you don't have to predict the Bitcoin USD to figure out what way the dominance is likely going to go right all you have to know is if Bitcoin holds the line at the 20 week or the bull Mark scorpion 20 week estimate the 21 qma dominance goes up and if it doesn't dominance goes up so I continue to ask myself for the last 18 months what's the point of buying\n",

      "The existing summary is: The video transcript discusses the Bitcoin dominance and its importance in the cryptocurrency market. The speaker argues that the Bitcoin dominance is a key metric to follow, as it can provide insights into the performance of the overall altcoin market. The speaker maintains that during the current stage of the market cycle, the Bitcoin dominance is likely to increase, to the detriment of the altcoin market. This is based on the speaker's observation that the altcoin market has generally underperformed Bitcoin over the past 18 months, with many altcoins losing value against Bitcoin. The speaker provides historical examples to support this view, showing how the altcoin market has tended to bleed against Bitcoin during periods when the Bitcoin dominance has risen. The speaker argues that this rotation of capital from altcoins to Bitcoin is a rational strategy, as it allows investors to maximize their risk-adjusted returns. The overall sentiment of the transcript is bearish on the altcoin market, with the speaker advising that the collective altcoin market is not worth the risk compared to Bitcoin. The main message and conclusion of the transcript is that the Bitcoin dominance is likely to continue rising, and that investors should focus on Bitcoin as a lower-risk option compared to altcoins.\n",

      "we were at this point saying that we were likely about to bounce whether Bitcoin held the line or not and that's the point right it's not you don't have to predict the Bitcoin USD to figure out what way the dominance is likely going to go right all you have to know is if Bitcoin holds the line at the 20 week or the bull Mark scorpion 20 week estimate the 21 qma dominance goes up and if it doesn't dominance goes up so I continue to ask myself for the last 18 months what's the point of buying all coins if if all they're going to do is likely bleed on their Bitcoin pairs what's the point you're taking on more risk for Less reward and and these people think they're right all the way down right all the way down they'll say well okay now it's a double bottom or it's a slightly lower low or it's an accumulation phase and what ends up happening their altcoin just keeps pushing lower on their Bitcoin pairs again the all coin Reckoning is not about all coins on their USD pairs I've explained this many times I mean they'd go down on their UFC pairs that's an artifact of it but the main point is that they go down on their Bitcoin pairs again look at this Bitcoin is at its yearly High total three is twenty percent below it's April High I said back over here that the highest I really thought total three would go in this rally was the low 400 billion range and that's more or less where it topped out the reason why I said that was because I was under the impression that we would not take out this high from 2022 this November High I did not think we would take that out and so far we haven't right eventually we probably will take it out eventually I'm not a Perma bear on the altcoin market okay I'm not it's just that you have to recognize that when total three does eventually make a sustained move back up to the upside it doesn't have to be because your altcoin is doing so it could be due to a new class of all coins that are doing well maybe a few of them for the prior from the prior cycle will do well but most of them will become relics of a prior cycle and no one will care about them anymore so again if if the path for total three let's just draw a potential path here right if the path does something like this right and then it finally starts to recover and go this way when it's back up here it doesn't mean that you're all coin is near is back near its highs it could just mean that some fancy new altcoin is going up 20x and and all the money's slowing into that right that's why I've said over and over and over it's dangerous to DCA into the collective altcoin market during a bear Market year and a pre-halving year for Bitcoin if you're going to DCA into something Bitcoin is by far the safer play right why because if Bitcoin goes up you get that exposure to bitcoin you get that exposure to the cryptiverse if it goes down then you can still use the Bitcoin that you have to buy all coins likely for a cheaper evaluation not all of them but some of most of them right again just go take a look where were the all coins 10 months ago or 12 months ago I mean look at the Ada Bitcoin used to be at 6 000 satoshi's now it's down to 900. remember what I said back 18 months ago that these all coins will become a shell of their former selves is that not what's happening dot Bitcoin and by the way look at Ada Bitcoin um look how far down it is from this high it's down 85 percent look at dot Bitcoin how far down is it oh look I mean the last time I measured it was down 81 now it's down 83 percent you might say well is that enough I don't know you tell me I mean last cycle ate a Bitcoin went down 95 now there's this idea of diminishing losses and we can talk about that um but on their Bitcoin pairs I don't know if that's true you might say well the altcoin's better than it was four years ago well so is Bitcoin right you're not comparing the altcoin to a static version of Bitcoin that remains unchanged there's been a lot of new development developments in Bitcoin over the last four years we have institutions filing for all these spot ETFs we have a lot more people interested in Bitcoin today than they were four years ago so don't compare your altcoin to what Bitcoin was four years ago compare your altcoin compared to compare all coin to what Bitcoin is today and if you do that I don't really think you can make the case that they're anything more than oscillators at best right they're also in my opinion most of them are oscillators at best so that means still that ADA Bitcoin could still fall another 50 percent from here do you think that back in you know when I was buying Ada back over here do you think that I thought it was going to go to 400 satoshi's hell no no the people the people that thought that they were clueless insane in my in my eyes there's no way that it could do something like that and what what happened Ada Bitcoin dropped after it rallied to 10 cents in 2019 it then dropped back down 80 percent again and I was wrecked okay I don't tell you this stuff because it makes me any friends it doesn't it just leads to everyone hating what I have to say but I'm telling you I've lived through it before this is the altcoin Reckoning they get wrecked on their Bitcoin pairs pretty much constantly and they get wrecked on their USD pairs when Bitcoin rolls over people just don't think they're people don't think their altcoin is getting wrecked because when Bitcoin goes up it kind of drags everything up with it but you get a slight correction Bitcoin rallies back up to its prior high at 31. where would where would total three be how high does total three need to Rally to get back up to its prior High 24 what's interesting is that its prior high is still lower than the November 2022 High whereas Bitcoin if you look at it's November 2022 High it's it's far surpassed it right far surpassed it about 40 above it look at this chart look how total market cap has more or less just been going sideways more or less wait a second bitcoin's up how is this going sideways because the money is rotating from the altcoins into Bitcoin this is the Bitcoin dominance rally and the dominance rally goes up when Bitcoin goes up and it goes up when Bitcoin goes down okay if you're curious as to when an altcoin might have actually found a low against Bitcoin look at this pattern from Ada Bitcoin back in in 2019. look here it found a low and held that low in a Bitcoin USD downtrend okay so not initially though so Bitcoin USD was starting going down starting in June Ada Bitcoin continued to go down Bitcoin USC continue to go down but at some point Ada Bitcoin was done bleeding 80 USD was not done bleeding until way over here but you'll see that ADA Bitcoin was holding these lows during a Bitcoin USD downtrend that starts to tell you that the altcoin market could become worth the risk right now you're still seeing Ada go down more or less than a Bitcoin uptrend as crazy as that sounds right as crazy as that sounds awsd has gone down in a Bitcoin uptrend you don't believe me if you don't believe me just take a look look at um 80 USD it recently put in a new low as recently as just like three or four weeks ago how is Ada putting in a new low when bitcoin's putting in new highs how it's dot putting in new lows when Bitcoin is putting in new highs link is putting in new lows when Bitcoin is putting in new highs I mean off by a couple weeks right I mean I'm not trying to say that it was today that these all coins put in a new low but you're still seeing these all coins at their range lows or lower than where they were back in 2022 just a couple weeks ago even though Bitcoins back up at its at its yearly High again it's the altcoin Reckoning it's where all coins get racked against Bitcoin on their Bitcoin they get wrecked on their Bitcoin pairs that liquidity flows back to bitcoin it's hard to know exactly where that liquidity for Bitcoin dries up to the point where it can no longer hold the line right it's hard to know how long if you look closely you will see in 2018 during the drop by Ether Bitcoin Bitcoin rally here up until ether Bitcoin got to around 0.058 right now it's a 0.061 in 2019 Bitcoin rallied until Ada Bitcoin got to around 800 satoshi's seven to eight hundred satoshi's right now it's at 900 satoshi's so you can learn a lot about the cryptoverse by looking at these these cryptocurrencies on their Bitcoin pairs the liquidity is Flowing from the altcoin market to bitcoin I can't be sure as to where we turn over where I can't be sure exactly where Bitcoin rolls over and heads back the other way what I can what I feel like I'm sure about which even then I'm not sure about but what I feel somewhat convinced of is that no matter what Bitcoin USD or sorry Bitcoin dominance will go up whether Bitcoin rolls over or not we've seen Bitcoin Hold the Line we know what happens when that happens dominance goes up we've seen what happens when Bitcoin goes below the 20 week dominance goes up so I have to ask myself what's the point of holding alts you know what's the point and normally you know normally when I say this you know you're going to have some type of rally by the altcoin market at some point and then everyone will say well you know what about altcoins but it doesn't change the fact that they just continue to bleed month after month after month against Bitcoin and they probably will continue to do so for at least a few more months the reason why you know we might have to rein in um the Maxi had at some point is because normally once you get to around September uh the dominance turns back the other way from whatever Direction it was headed okay so like if you look at 2022 dominance was going down into it and we talked about how it will likely go back up when it gets through it and it did if you look at at 2021 you'll see a very similar thing right I mean it wasn't sustained for as long but dominance went down into September and then it turned back the other way and then and then look at 2020. dominance was going down into September and then it went up after it and then look at 2019 dominance was going up into September and then it rolled over into the latter part of the year and then look at 2018 dominance was going up into September and then it rolled over into the latter part of the year and then the list goes on and on right and we could we could talk about this forever but you'll more or less see the same thing over and over and over again right dominance going down in September and then it went up going into the latter part of the year so this September could Mark a temporary turning point for the dominance it doesn't have to be a permanent stop you could see something like this right where the Dominus rallies up to 60 by September pulls back to 55 by by the having right and then goes up even more in late 2024 early 2025 right you could see something like that I mean this dominance here it was at 73 in January of 2021. just something to think about right I mean I'm just saying I'm not saying you know what I'm saying right and this is the point is is that look at the year-to-date Roi and the prehabbing years for Bitcoin 2015 2019 and 2023 all of these years into the year positive ethereum did not in 2019. even though Bitcoin into the year up 2x ethereum closed below its yearly open look at ethereum today my guess good chance it could close below the yearly open by the end of the year it almost seems like this year is a tempered version of 2019. does it not at one point we started off ahead of it right but ever since then I mean it seems like somewhat of a tempered version of it look at Ada you know look at Ada by the way I'll say one more thing if you think that I'm just picking on certain all coins because I like to pick on them honestly I feel like if I talk about an altcoin a lot that should be in my view it's more of a compliment it means hey I'm interested enough to follow it so maybe one day I'll actually buy it you know um it's nothing personal it's just business but look at Ada USD in 2019 over here compared to now again it's just a tempered version of what happened in 2019. and look what happened in the back half of the year look at these on their Bitcoin pairs look at Ada Bitcoin in 2019 compared to 2023 . look at this chart right look at it look at ether Bitcoin in 2019 compared to 2023. you can you can go on and on right I mean we could we could look at this for a long time maybe Litecoin Litecoin Bitcoin 2019 versus 2023 you should get the idea okay again total market cap has gone sideways for the most part minus a few hundred billion right Bitcoins at the yearly highs so how the hell is total market cap at the same thing it was that bitcoin's pushing higher it's because the altcoin market is losing valuation look at the dominance excluding stable coins you know one of the biggest things I see is that people say well you know the dominance exclu includes stable coins therefore it shouldn't matter anymore you know because stablecoins take up a significant portion of the market cap and to some degree they're right I mean if you look at usdt um plus uh usdc plus die plus the busd market cap sorry I think I misspelled no I got it right 115 billion and total Market is 1.15 trillion so the stablecoin market cap takes up approximately 10 percent of the of the entire market cap but it's also in a downtrend it's also a downtrend and really where the altcoin market collapsed by the way is when total three look at this collapse right here is when it took out this March low you know why that's interesting is because um and this is a bit of a tangent but if you go look at at total assets by the Fed I've been tracking this right it's almost about to go below its March low and you could make a case that the s p is is is potentially trying to find some type of of local time okay um it doesn't have to be you know a major top but it could at least be a local time so I I do think this is important to track but look listen I mean the stable coin Market it has been going down this is also a Tailwind for dominance because you know you if if this is going down that I think people are likely going to just seek the relative safety of Bitcoin over all coins if they're if they're not going into stables and if they are going into Cash they're probably not going to go into Stables as likely they're just going to go into USD because maybe they don't trust the stable coin market after everything has happened so but my here's the point though despite the fact that the stablecoin market took up such a large percentage of the market cap you know one of the things I see on Twitter is people say well dominance goes lower every cycle I'm like what chart are you looking at because I don't know what university you're living in but in my universe that's not true in my universe the one that I'm living in the cryptoverse that I'm living in what do I see I see An Inconvenient Truth is that the dominance went lower in 2018 than it ever did in 2022 and by the way the stablecoin market in 2019 was like 4 billion right so despite the fact that you had all this money in stable coins the dominance could still not put in a new low so how can you even say that dominance moves lower every cycle how can we say that we can't this is a a higher low a macro higher low now also we're witnessing lower highs as well if you connect these dots you can see the 60 level right well this is a log scale maybe you should um look at it on a linear scale since it's a um since it's the dominance 59 right could easily go above it but there's no guarantee that it has to break back down you know what happens if it if it rallies up into September gets rejected at like 60 percent comes back down and then breaks out the following year and does something like this you know there is a chance that it's an oscillator there's a chance that this is the initial capitalization of the altcoin market right here and that it turns into an oscillator as time goes on meaning that rather than continue to go down forever maybe it just stays in this range for uh for a long time where it just sort of goes back and forth rather than continues to go down right like there's a chance that this is the case and if this is the case then it could go it could go above 60 percent right if this is how it plays out again you know when you look at something like total three divided by Bitcoin kind of looks like an oscillator you know if it can go up to one more than once and if it can go down to 0.25 more than once currently it's at 0.55 I put forth the idea that total three could easily drop another 50 against Bitcoin think about how crazy that is I mean the all coin Market's already wrecked enough and if Bitcoin goes up to say 35k that's going to keep getting wrecked on their Bitcoin pairs I don't care about their USD pairs don't tell me about their USD pairs it's irrelevant because look what happens the minute Bitcoin rolls over all those all coins are most of them they just get decimated look what happened to Ada Carta or look at what happened to Ada Solana polka dot and Avalanche and chain link and and Matic look at what happened to all of them when Bitcoin rolled over even though it was temporary even though Bitcoin has gone back to its yearly High those all coins got crushed on their Bitcoin Pairs and their USD Pairs and most of them have not recovered to where they were even though Bitcoin has so when I look at this I can't help but think that the altcoin market needs to drop another 50 percent against Bitcoin it's gonna happen in my opinion as Bitcoin goes up or down doesn't matter it's irrelevant to me the point is that the altcoin market should lead back to bitcoin so when you look at the dominance of Bitcoin including Stables even though you're including Stables which people will say is a reason to ignore the dominance it's still put in a higher low how is that not bullish for the Bitcoin dominance right it's still put in a higher low when you exclude Stables which is arguably a better way to look at it higher lows since 2018. even this here this new low here compared to January 2022 right so you can see September 2022 went lower than January 2022. this was including Stables when you exclude Stables dominance was putting in higher lows since May of 2021. we've been making videos on about this forever about how every time this comes back down everyone gets all up in arms about how the all coin markets are performing all I see are higher lows and if you overlay a 30-day moving average you can see this massive base getting built out to go higher look at a 90-day moving average of it we've talked about this forever as well you could overlay the total Market or the total summary risk of Bitcoin onto the Bitcoin dominance might be a useful exercise and you can see that you know perhaps this move here was sort of this one and then we're in sort of the secondary move where it goes up as Bitcoin rallies and then kind of Fate the Bitcoin USD evaluation and risk goes back down as the dominant sort of Fades but I don't think we're there yet right I think we're still in this process where the dominance is just going up look at monthly returns in pre-halving years okay 2015 half green half red see well maybe seven green seven green five red 2019 six red six green 2023 five green one rod what happens the next six months I don't know but I can't tell you that in 2019 five of the first six months were green as well and then five of the last six were red so again my my my the idea that I've said for a long time is that in the prehabbing year Bitcoin spends about half the year going up and half the year going down it's hard to know exactly what in what order but what normally happens is that both bulls and bears get sufficiently wrecked on the on the USD Pairs and all and the altcoin gets marked the altcoin market gets wrecked on their Bitcoin pair for basically the\n",

      "The video transcript discusses the importance of Bitcoin dominance in the cryptocurrency market. The speaker argues that Bitcoin dominance is a key metric to follow, as it can provide insights into the performance of the overall altcoin market. The speaker maintains that during the current stage of the market cycle, the Bitcoin dominance is likely to increase, to the detriment of the altcoin market.\n",
      "\n",
      "This view is based on the speaker's observation that the altcoin market has generally underperformed Bitcoin over the past 18 months, with many altcoins losing significant value against Bitcoin. The speaker provides historical examples to support this, showing how the altcoin market has tended to bleed against Bitcoin during periods when the Bitcoin dominance has risen. The speaker argues that this rotation of capital from altcoins to Bitcoin is a rational strategy, as it allows investors to maximize their risk-adjusted returns.\n",

      "The additional context further reinforces the speaker's bearish sentiment on the altcoin market. The speaker contends that most altcoins have continued to lose value against Bitcoin, even as Bitcoin has reached new highs. This is exemplified by the performance of altcoins like Cardano, Polkadot, and Avalanche, which have seen significant declines against their Bitcoin pairs despite Bitcoin's recent rally.\n",

      "The overall sentiment of the transcript remains bearish on the altcoin market, with the speaker advising that the collective altcoin market is not worth the risk compared to Bitcoin.

      "the first six months were green as well and then five of the last six were red so again my my my the idea that I've said for a long time is that in the prehabbing year Bitcoin spends about half the year going up and half the year going down it's hard to know exactly what in what order but what normally happens is that both bulls and bears get sufficiently wrecked on the on the USD Pairs and all and the altcoin gets marked the altcoin market gets wrecked on their Bitcoin pair for basically the entirety of the Year Okay so but the more important thing is is looking at at say ethereum Bitcoin monthly returns we talked about this going into June that starting from June to December it's not a great time for for ethereum on its Bitcoin pair on average it goes down eight percent in June large standard deviation sure it's down it's down eleven and a half percent in June so far look at the prehabbing years 2019. five of the last seven months were read okay 2015 we only have it for the last five months of the year they were all red on their Bitcoin on bitcoin pair look at Ada Bitcoin in 2019 only only five of the months were green but but three of those months that were green were only green by like one percent the red months were like 20 losses negative 22 percent negative 20 negative 27 negative 16 negative 26 here's a negative 14 percent so this is the idea right this is the idea this is how I mean look at look at Solana Bitcoin since October negative seven percent negative 48 negative 27 up 72 everyone loses their Collective Minds then down eight down twenty one up five down two down 29. ultimately it just finds itself back near its its low on its Bitcoin pair despite that crazy rally in January it's back to its lows this is the all coin Reckoning and I've said for a long time that until the ethereum Bitcoin valuation collapses it should provide a Tailwind for the Bitcoin dominance remember in the end even the Giants will fall and that includes ethereum this here was a fake out just like every other one this is a new low now yes if you look at it on a daily time frame maybe you could argue that it could get some type of a bounce okay but I'm telling you right even if it does even if it does I still think it eventually resolves to the downside okay I still think it eventually resolves to the downside just as it has been since late 2021 lower highs since late 2021. and this is the this is the thing right I mean I I think it will likely come back down to that 0.05 level maybe find some type of of relief for a little bit and then roll over into that .03 to 0.04 range okay and that's ultimately where I see it ending up um and again it was just a fake out so when you go around the cryptoverse and people tell you that the Bitcoin dominance doesn't matter because you can't trade it or anything the dominance would have told you 18 months ago that all coins were not worth the risk and since then the altcoin market just continues to more or less bleed you will always have people that will tell you to buy the dip on the altcoin market you will always have people that will say that eventually total three will probably put in new highs most of the altcoins that made up the highs over here will likely not make up whatever its new high is going to be those will likely become a relic of a prior cycle except for a few there will likely be a few that will go on to take out their prior highs I've seen it happen multiple times there it's happened I mean look ethereum took out its prior highs in the last cycle cardano took out its prior highs it can happen you can see some coins go to new Highs but most of them will probably not that is a fact okay we've seen this many many times most of them are scams actually so when people tell you that the Bitcoin dominance doesn't matter show them the altcoin market chart on its Bitcoin pair and ask them why really since the end of November alts are down 48 against Bitcoin if the dominance doesn't matter why are some of these all coins putting in new lows as recently as three weeks ago the Dominus would have told you all this that their the risk is not justified right I would have said this all so remember at the end of the day the the thing that I want to make sure that I do is is to try to be as honest as I can I don't get everything right that's that's for sure like we know that I do not get everything right I get a lot of things wrong we can be honest about that but when you look at things like the altcoin season index we talked a lot about how it's likely going to go into Bitcoin season and stay there for a long time and now it's doing that right and this is the 90 day if you look at the 30 day you can see that it just collapsed all the way back down so the 90 day will likely also come back down look at a 30-day moving average of it right I think it's gonna I think it's gonna fall back in there's also some idea too that this 20 the 2018 move here or sorry the 2022 move by this index looks more like 2019 and perhaps this one looks more like 2018. I mean look at it it came to the same level right and when it went back up it wasn't because all coins were done bleeding it was just because they eventually were done bleeding on their Bitcoin pairs for a little bit and they still collapsed on their on their USD pairs so you know I I say all this stuff just to sort of remind you that the altcoin market can bleed for far longer than you think look at cardano's last bear Market if it were to play out the same way it would mean it doesn't find a low until November now you might say that that was a Black Swan but guys look we're still looking at an inverted yield curve okay and I don't know what they're going to call it a Black Swan whatever it ends up being but when you have treasure yield spreads look like this it doesn't normally resolve in a positive manner the market can rally like the s p can rally during the inversion process right I mean it historically can do that we see that we've seen that occur many many times it can go up during that time it's the uninversion process that's what that what that's what hurts that's What Hurts the Most right it's the uninversion process and we're not there yet okay so again when someone tells you and because they'll tell you this right when someone tells you that the Bitcoin dominance does not matter ask them why did it put in a higher low compared to 2018 if it includes stable coins if it doesn't matter then why are all coins continuing to bleed for the last year and a half on their Bitcoin pairs if it doesn't matter ask them why why they're putting money into these into these random all coins when they just bleed back to the kink okay I'm not saying they're gonna bleed forever but I'm saying they've been bleeding for the last year and a half and we've been talking about it every step of the way and people faded every step of the way and every month they just more or less go lower remember in the end even the Giants will fall and that does include ethereum okay on its Bitcoin pair and you can see it right 0.06116 remember the Bitcoin dominance is the key to unlocking the secrets of the cryptographers thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at into the at into the cryptiverse.com I'll see you guys next time bye\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the equity verse today we're going to take a look at the S P 500 return on investment after yield curve inversion if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the crypto virus premium uh into the cryptiverse.com let's go ahead and jump in now we have spoken somewhat frequently about the yield curve and how it is useful in understanding macro economic conditions and right now you will see again that the yield curve does in fact remain inverted and it has been inverted for quite some time we can scroll back the clock here and see that it really started to become at least parts of it became started to become inverted as as early as late 2022 and of course it's been inverted more or less ever since if you were to get it go back in time and find other examples where we had yield curve inversion there was a period before the 2007 recession uh or the 2008 2009 recession where we had yield curve inversion uh there was a period before the.com recession that we had yield curve inversion and then also going back to to the 1990s um we don't actually have it on here but this was the recession and then of course just before it we had an inverted yield curve so one of the things that I think it's important to remind ourselves of is that unlike you know things like cryptocurrency the macro stuff can take a very long time to play out I mean sometimes it can take years for it to ultimately play out again if you were to go back to 2007 we had an inverted yield curve and the market didn't really start to get you know pretty nasty until a year or two later you know your year and a half later so again this stuff can take quite a long period of time now to visualize yield curve inversions you of course can also pick out two specific time frames and compare them for instance when when the economy is is healthy you would argue that you know lower duration treasuries would yield less than than longer duration treasuries but when you're when the economy is is kind of sick you'll often see things like where the three month is is providing a better um yield at least annualize and then say something like the tenure so what we're going to look at are treasury yield spreads okay so this is the spread of the 10-year and the three months and again as you can see normally during the inversion process we are not in a recession right that's not typically what we see during the inversion it's not to say that it can't ever happen like you can see from the 1980s but oftentimes especially when you go into an inversion you're not in a recession in fact if someone just told you in the future some random date in the future that hey on this date in this year we're gonna see we're gonna we're gonna see the three month invert the tenure and they asked you do you think we're going to be in a recession when that occurs you're probably better off answering no because again normally when we become when it becomes inverted you're not in a recession and it can take quite some time for us to actually get to the uninversion process to give you an example in 2000 uh the doc just before the.com crash and in the summer you can see that we had inverted yield curve but it didn't we didn't become uninverted right until about what six months later or so it was longer during the financial crisis we had an inversion back over here in July 2006 the market kept pushing higher for basically another year or maybe slightly more maybe about 14 months before it actually topped out now just because it had this rally right here during the inversion process did not mean that the market was immune to to what could theoretically occur after it right I mean and sort of zooming out here even though we became inverted here the market rallied for you know well over a year and we still eventually took out that entire rally it just took a long time to do so right it took a long time to do so and remember that the markets will make fools of both sides right in 2022 we made fine uh the market sort of um made a joke of of the Bulls in 2023 so far it's more or less made a joke of the Bears and and this is what the market does right it's what the market does but you can see that even in this yield curve inversion even though we still slightly went higher eventually the market did did roll over and I think the bigger question is well how long could this actually take I mean you know the process of the inversion of three month and tenure um we've seen it we've seen it last a few months over here by the way if you're curious from inversion to uninversion it was almost it was about a year at least once it was sustained about a year and for this cycle we didn't get our inversion of the three months of the tenure uh really until October of 2022. so you know we're only a few months away right July August September October just four months from now it will have been an entire year since we saw the three month and the 10 the and the 10-year experience that inversion that's nothing out of the ordinary it's not right and history shows us that the s p you know will climb the wall of worry it can for some time but you still have to deal with the eventual resolution of the yield curve right whether it happens three months from now six months from now nine months or 12 months it's really hard to know it really is and you know you're not going to find a more concrete answer for me right it's hard to know exactly when the uninversion process will take place if you're gonna go look at what the bond market is predicting they're constantly changing their minds only you know at the beginning of this year the market was pricing in rate Cuts as early as now now as early as June or July and now the the the bond market is basically saying there's not going to be any rate Cuts until 2024. the fed you know at this meeting last week Powell said they don't Envision rate Cuts until for two years so again there does seem to be a fair uh you know a fairly strong disconnect between what's going on uh over with the fat over at the fat and what the what the bond market thinks and of course the s p just can as it has and continues to to sort of just climb the wall of worry okay now at some point we're going to likely see this uninvert right and if you zoom in to the uninversion process right it's like the.com crash the uninversion process the s p was already had already rolled over during this uninversion process the s p did continue to climb up just a little bit more and during this uninversion process back over here you can see that the s p climbed up just a little bit more but in all three cases we did eventually go into a recession on the other side of it okay and you can look at the spread on the 10-year and the two-year as well and and that might be you know informative too you know we've we've been this one's been inverted even longer right going all the way back to July of 2022. so the two year and the 10-year have been inverted for almost a year already and they had a brief inversion as early as April of 2022 but it wasn't sustained until July is this out of the ordinary not really right I mean over here we had an inversion we briefly put back above it but from this first inversion you know like in late 2005 we didn't come out of this until early 2007. so again some sometimes this you know the the inversion process the inversion the amount of time that we see the old curve inverted can last over a year right sometimes even longer a year and a half or sometimes even longer than that so we have to be aware of this of this potential reality and even during the 1980s you know we were inverted for for quite a long period of time and you know eventually eventually we got you know we saw an uninversion and and of course during this process we ultimately did go into a recession You could argue that during periods of high inflation we are more likely to go into a recession before it uninverts and the reason why the reason for that could be due to you know a more um uh a more hawkish fat right more resistant to wanting to cut rates because of high inflation and so they might just stay the course of it longer than they otherwise would have so there are of course periods where you can see a recession during an inversion but what you will often find is that the time at the time in which the the curve does become inverted right when the two year inverts the tenure you're often not looking at a recession at that time it doesn't mean that you can't go into one at some point during the inversion but oftentimes when you're not experiencing High inflation you will see a recession come after the uninversion and then sometimes when you're experiencing High inflation the recession can come still why the still while the yield curve is in fact inverted but I thought it would be interesting to sort of plot out here how the s p has performed uh after yield curve inversion right doesn't that seem like a useful exercise so just algorithmically if you were to go back for several decades you know going back to the early 1980s and just sort of plot out what the s p does after an inverted yield curve of more than like just like a day it has to be inverted for a few days if it's just like a single day we throw it out this is what you ultimately get so this is the S P 500 Roi too low after yield curve inversion and if we ignore the current one this is what it normally looks like right so normally you you can get a rally after it but eventually we do see it typically roll over this was the.com crash over here this was the financial crisis this was 1989 you can see the 1989 rallied on up uh to a pretty nice level uh you know over 1X um or over over basically where it become became inverted right so like it didn't just go down the minute that the old curve inverted it actually went up for a while and stayed as stayed above one for as long as you know about two-thirds of a year or so before It ultimately came back down now if you overlay the current cycle you can see that we've outperformed even the most optimistic case that we've had in the past which was I believe 1989. so if you were to throw on here let me find the right one because there were several several of them so 1989 and then I want to Overlay the current one right so this is an example where the market rallied and it still eventually rolled over um you know once once things got got bad enough I do think that it's important to consider just the longevity of of you know of this process right like just how long it can take and it can take a really long time for this to play out now arguably you could say well is this time different normally going down that path is a fairly dangerous path to go down because normally it's not different right sometimes the amount of time it takes uh is different right normally that's different but the end result is usually not different and so I guess the question is is well how long can can this go on until it finally rolls over and history shows us that um at this point you know we've outperformed at least going back to the early 1980s we've outperformed all of those now there are some unprecedented events this business cycle for instance the FED printing six trillion dollars also do note that we did have um you know a fairly long downturn in the S P 500 just before um or a right or you know just before we we got into some of this conversion inversion process but at the end of the day you know we still have to eventually come to terms with the uninversion process and you know it's hard to say exactly how high equities can rally until that time I will be completely honest and say that they've gone higher than I thought they would okay um they have I I didn't really think they would they would go this high but they have and and here we are uh so we need to we need to be aware of of how Equity markets can in fact do this uh just to give you kind of an example here I was looking at this earlier um uh the Russell 2000 you know at least last cycle we put in a low in 2018 and then we rallied even through the yield curve inversion and even after it it inverted or after it uninverted and then it still ended up putting in a new low we actually saw something similar in 2014 we didn't have an inverted yield curve but we put in a low in the in sort of the midterm year we rallied and then put in a lower low in the presidential election year um so it's interesting to see if something like that would play out where it you know it rallies and then eventually puts in a new low uh maybe maybe sometime early next year or or later on this year but I did think that this was an interesting concept sort of plot out the ROI uh too low after yield curve inversion and do note that this 2022 one and 2023 one is assuming uh that the lowest still to come right I mean all these other ones we have the advantage of hindsight where we can look to see did the low come later or did it not during this process we don't actually know for instance if the s p does eventually drop but it puts in say a higher low than the low would have already happened if it puts in a lower low then it makes sense to continue plotting this but at this point right it's still too early on in the process to to fully know why we just simply cannot know at this time and we can also plot this for you know Roi to low after say the the inversion of of the two year and the ten year and see what that looks like and you know from this process what's going on right now doesn't really look that out of the ordinary uh with that said it still has rallied longer at this point in time than all these other Cycles going back to the late 1970s there was once one cycle though that actually had a that topped out just north of where it is today although it topped out a lot earlier right it still it still eventually topped out and I'm sure you can guess which one that was it was of course 2019 right so in 2019 if we take a a closer look at this you can see that It ultimately rallied um a fairly significant amount after the inversion of the two-year and the tenure and it convenient it continue to Rally even after the old curve uninverted but then at some point we got the pandemic and then and then sort of the bottom fell out right so a lot of things to consider here hopefully you guys enjoy the content if you do make

      "    foreign [Music] hey everybody hope everyone's doing wonderfully well welcome to the no-shill Zone with uh Ben Cowan my pleasure to have him here with us we did our show last week and we're back again to do it again so uh Ben how you doing today buddy pretty good how about you pleasure to be here again yeah absolutely see looks like you got you're on vacation relaxing a little bit yeah yeah we're just trying to trying to enjoy the summer you know soak up the sun but uh the markets are are alive at all times so we still got to do this so absolutely absolutely very cool so so I know people are here and wanting the Alpha and the information and the no-shilling part portion which gets us into the the the nitty-gritty of the data as well as kind of the charts and so I would I would say first to you Ben is is where do we stand I mean last week we came in the the SEC had just kind of smoked the altcoins we were talking about Bitcoin dominance from that point to this point where are you sitting yeah so I think and I mean I'll I'll show the the dominance on my screen but one of the things that I I continue to reiterate with with the SEC and and sort of the idiosyncratic risk of the altcoin market the regulatory risk of the altcoin market is that they're likely going to continue bleeding against Bitcoin for and and for for likely I'm I'm guessing until September um and I I briefly touched on this last time but I was having some issues sharing my screen last time so maybe I'll take a minute to just kind of show my point of view here is that you know normally September's March changes in the Bitcoin dominance like whatever is going on before September it kind of seems like we see a shift around that September time frame if we're going down we start going up if we're going up we start going down and so what I'm expecting is if I were to maybe potentially draw a path here for the dominance I'm kind of expecting the dominance to continue its breakout um and and actually go near that 60 level by potentially you know September number plus or minus one month or so at that point I kind of expect it to pull back I mean that'll likely be around the time that a lot of people finally put on you know they they put on their Bitcoin Maxi had and normally once everyone starts to agree then you get a more substantial pullback uh but I don't think we're at that point yet I still think that we need to see the dominance break out and go a lot higher now one thing Gareth that we you know we talked about a little bit is that when we break the Range High on the dominance back in 2018 and when we broke it in 2019 in both cases we actually had about a one week period where we didn't move right where the dominance basically just stayed flat for about one week and then the next week it went up by like three or four points like three or four percentage points so like we went from in 2018 we went from 50 percent to 50 54 in one week and in 2019 we went from um uh 64 to 68 in one week so I'm still you know I'm sitting here thinking like you know within the next maybe even this week uh but within the next couple of weeks like I wouldn't be surprised if we see a more substantial breakout on the Bitcoin dominance uh to you know to fifty percent fifty one percent fifty two percent and maybe even just a bit higher what do you what are you thinking yeah so um just flipping over to my screen here and we can talk a little bit about that so what's interesting is what I'm getting from you is that you're saying you think that we'll go up to about 60 in terms of dominance and I think last week we talked about the charts and what it showed and the beauty of it is is there's this awesome trend line that is right at 60 right so is am I correct and that's what you're thinking it's headed towards yeah I think around 60 is is a good year is a good Target for this year for sure yeah so so I think that makes sense the question I would have and a lot of people are wondering like has Bitcoin bottom so so for me I'm not convinced that Bitcoin has bottomed even if it remains higher in the dominance Factor could it be that the all coins are still headed much much much lower Bitcoin may come down a little bit maybe retest that 15-7 or even go lower level but it still increases the dominance in there and again I was curious about your thoughts on that yeah let me show my screen here for a minute because there's a couple different ways to look at this the first way to look at it is in every cycle in every you know Market we we see Bitcoin bleed for a while and then it gets a rally um and it's in that rally that we break the Range High on the Bitcoin dominance if if we were to Overlay uh the Bitcoin dominance on just the price scale here right we can see that Bitcoins rally here in 2018 half of that rally was accompanied um by Bitcoin or sorry the half of the dominance rally was accompanied by Bitcoin going up and then the other half the dominance rally was accompanied by Bitcoin going down and and then ultimately what happened is that you know the the market sort of leveled off for a few months and then and then the actual bottom was found right so that's what we saw back then and one thing that I I think is is interesting today is we actually saw the very a very similar thing right Bitcoin rallied for the first four and a half months of the year the dominance broke the 49 back in April and now I think we're in this process where the dominance is continuing to go up as Bitcoin goes down now fundamentally the reason why I think that's happening is because there's this there's this move from like higher risk altcoins to lower risk cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and so for a long time people just convert their altcoins back to the safety of Bitcoin right it's not to say that they can go lower it's just that it's safer than insert you know random altcoin right and so though that those conversions can keep the valuation of Bitcoin propped up but at some point I think there's just no longer sufficient liquidity in the altcoin market to to support uh valuations you know these higher Bitcoin valuations right and so then people are converting back to bitcoin but there's still so much cell pressure on bitcoin side that it it it just keeps coming back down now I think where where the issue is what happens when all the liquidities dried up right and look if you look really closely here you know there there is a a period here where the the Bitcoin dominance rally was this July rally right here right and you can see that um this was something I don't really know that I've even talked about this before but from this low here to this low it was about a 12 drop right and then after this 12 drop that's where the dominance rally happened back in 2018. and if you look today you can kind of see a similar thing right like this low here to this one was also about a 12 drop and that is where the dominance rally started right so there is you know there's a risk that we still have to come back down and as you said Gareth I mean there's a course of risk that that Bitcoin does in fact put in a new low yeah do do you foresee a a portion of like let's say a time in the future where Bitcoin dominance goes above 60 like I mean you know 60 is the target based on your data based on the charts but I mean let's say five years from now is Bitcoin like the biggest thing and then you just have one or two little alts that make up ten percent of the market and everything else has gone to zero or or do you think that it kind of stops around that level yeah so I think there's a there's actually some conflicting views here and I'd like to get your opinion on this too so if you the the chart I have on the screen right now is is actually the dominance excluding stable coins because I think that there's like there's a dominance on trading view which includes the stable coin market and you have to ask yourself of course well you know should we track should we be tracking the dominance excluding stable coins right like where you're actually looking at the altcoin market with respect to bitcoin and when you look at it like this what you'll see is that the dominance excluding Stables is already at almost 55 um but it's also been putting in lower highs right like one lower high after another and I think that's what a lot of people look at but there's another thing to look at too it's been putting in higher lows since 2018 right I mean like this was you know 32 or something and I keep thinking like You know despite all the VC money despite all this the nft despite all this stuff the Dominus didn't even put in a new low yeah so I'm thinking like and if you if you kind of Connect the Dots here and draw them out the line lines converge in 2026 actually is when we actually see them convert so I I don't know what way it's going to break it might actually depend on on you know regulatory Clarity but what do you think yeah I I think that you know from from my perspective is is definitely Bitcoins on that track to be that digital gold asset and I think ethereum is is likely the silver kind of of the the crypto markets and what's interesting about gold and silver right so gold is your Pure Play where it's just a store of safety inflation hedge all that kind of stuff and then ethereum is like silver in that silver is more volatile than gold so Bitcoin is less volatile and and ethereum is more volatile than Bitcoin but also ethereum has a use case right Bitcoin there's you know you don't really see a lot of stuff being built on on top of that so so I think those my guess is and again I could be wrong here but my guess is the future is those two make up probably 80 plus of the overall market and then you might have some of these other smaller coins kind of carving out their niches but but it's hard to know I mean now we have we have you know what the biggest news in the last week was that BlackRock filed for uh ETF right and so the question is and I think the big question we saw a little rally in crypto because of this is does this mean because there's such a mega financial institution that they talked to Gary Gensler and Gary Gensler might have said Hey listen yeah Bitcoin isn't a a security so we're gonna give you the biggest financial institution the green light because I think if you look at the stats right I blackrocks filed for like 75 ETFs they've gotten approved on 74 of them right so they needless they obviously have this kind of ability to kind of say okay if we're going to do this the probabilities of success are very high yet we've seen the SEC reject time and time again a spot ETF so so it's kind of interesting here one of the things I I it's funny because we have we've never even talked about this before you said the uh the Bitcoin dominant you think Bitcoin and ethereum collectively could make up about 80 or so uh if you look at my screen here this is the Bitcoin dominance plus the ethereum dominance and to me it looks like an oscillator where it's around 85 it comes down to around 55 back to 85 back into 55 and I mean it kind of seems like it's just in the process of going back to 85 you know um so I mean it's just it's interesting because we we go through these periods where you know no one can ever imagine you know the Blue Chips taking up such a majority of the market share and then that's what ends up happening and then once we get to that point everyone will say that all coins are dead and they'll never recover and then we get all season it's just it's interesting how we ebb and flow I and I don't have this sort of um you know I don't have this data and it's just you know what you said just jogged my memory or to think about this but I'd love to know the dominance of gold and silver versus Palladium Platinum copper in terms of of of of that you know like what's if I don't know if there is a chart of kind of looking at that and do you look at it in the same way of value um versus versus you know use case I don't know but just interesting to kind of look at that and say okay well platinum's used in batteries we know silver is too but I mean these other metals I mean copper is used in wiring it's it's a massively used but it doesn't have a high value because it's not a a scarce asset right it's it's only three dollars per per um per unit so anyway just something I was thinking about there in terms of relating it to the commodity markets I might I might actually try to get that chart for next week so we can talk about it that would be cool to see man very cool so what I do want to show here and I'm going to flip over to my screen here is I do want to go over that gold chart a lot of people have been asking me you know do you still see gold breaking out this year we've kind of see gold languishing here and the one thing I would just point to and this brings us over to the stock market side of things is that gold is stalling here but what we're seeing is there's a massive inflow of bullishness into the market so in general when you see stocks like Nvidia going to new all-time highs and things in general you see gold falling more because it's it's a safety hedge right it's people saying hey I don't want to be in Gold because I want to be in Risk assets where I'm going to make more than a few percent on a yearly basis which is more along the lines of what you expect from gold and so I find it fascinating and it's the same sort of thought process that I had when when we were trading at the lows on gold in in 2022 and going back to 2021 and the markets were at their highs you weren't seeing and by the way this is when the Fed was Raising most aggressively and generally gold reacts very negatively to hikes and interest rates gold was not breaking down outside of this kind of choppiness it got to this low end and then started to Rally back so for me when I look at the price action in gold gold is staying stable while you're seeing risk assets aside from crypto rallying substance actually I think the NASDAQ now is year-to-date up something like 38 I mean a massive massive move and so to me this is a very bullish sign for gold it's telling me that that you have sellers that are moving out of gold to move into risk assets but there's definitely buyers there thus price is not falling um I don't know if you have any thoughts on gold but I'd love to hear them yeah I you know I I will say you know going into 2022 for people that are on my channel I know you were very you were saying back then like this was back in 2021 when like everyone was bullish crypto right you're like Gold's gonna outperform Bitcoin in in 2022 and I mean it did by a lot right I mean Bitcoin dropped 77 uh or so during that year so that was a great call I I think that my view on gold is kind of like where we were in 2019 is is that we saw a massive pullback uh in in crypto in 2019 and it was more so just a marginal pullback in assets like gold right where they pulled back to their 20-week SMA um and their 21 week EMA in 2019 but that's ultimately what held out support right you can see we held that support in May of 2019 we had a support in you know late 2019 I kind of think that's what's happening here as well is my guess um but the the thing that I I think back to is how gold and silver had pullbacks but and so did the s p but crypto as a whole right if you take just like say Bitcoin Bitcoin only rallied for half the year and it fell it Bitcoin fell kind of when when gold fell right like into this but gold kept going whereas Bitcoin did not right like Bitcoin kept falling until until you know April of or March of 2020 so I kind of think we're in a similar phase where we likely will see gold continue to to do pretty well um as we as we as we continue to push forward in this in this business cycle interesting now now turning to the business cycle what what are we thinking in terms of you know right now you're hearing soft Landing you're hearing you know you know stocks are going to make new all-time highs um and in all fairness I've been offsides on this I mean I I was I was bearish over the last month or so and and the markets have just ripped up so so it's one of those things where is the are the masses as they turn bullish and and they're they're fomoing into stocks are they going to be right or are we going to see cracks in this narrative that everything is going to be okay yeah that's a good question because I I think it's I think it's probably a a positioning thing I think a lot of people are are are positioning for the more bearish outcome just because things fundamentally are starting to crack you know and I know you were talking about this as well before uh but initial claims you know they've been pushing higher recently I think they've been around 260. I mean I I think before we before we need before we see the unemployment rate at like four or five percent uh we need to see initial claims continuing to put in high high prints right if we just go back down then it'll likely just be nothing but normally you can see that initial claims lead the unemployment rates like the orange line on this chart is the unemployment rate and then the blue Rod the the blue are sorry the the orange line is the initial claims and the blue line is the unemployment rate and normally the unemployment rate moves after initial claims goes up and and you can see I mean recently initial claims has been really starting to climb back up um yeah some more slowly and there's this other thing I was looking at recently as well and it's it's basically the the ROI to low after a yield of inversion so like going back to the 1980s this is the S P 500 Roi to low after the three month inverted the 10-year and you can see that this current cycle is definitely outperforming prior ones like where we are but we can also see that there are cycles that you know they still held up pretty well and then eventually they put in new lows now I was sort of toying around with this and just looking at random spreads between like you know different things that a lot of people might not care to look at but an interesting one was the spread between the two year and the five-year and if you isolate just say like the you know this orange one up here which is the one back in 2007 2008 you can see that it was also you know climbing the wall of worry and continued to do so for you know from where we are it continued to do so for probably another three months or so before it really finally started to roll over I think the you know Gareth my view right now is just that there's just so much excess liquidity and the FED is is doing the best they can to drain it but it's just taking a long time to drain it yeah it makes a lot of sense I I think you're right on that is that that we we hear that they've raised interest rates by X percent um which has been huge I mean the the velocity of the raise I think is the shocking part you know to from going from a quarter basis point to where we are above five percent is just massive if but then you look at how much excess liquidity there was in the system because of covet and then you look at all right wages have increased substantially so people have more money I do think like you're saying there are cracks emerging right so last last Monday when we did the no-shill Zone we talked about the jobless claims from the previous week being 266 000 and that was the biggest jump since 2021 in in people filing for unemployment and what I was saying is last week to really watch the next number because sometimes you get these outliers you know that could the data changes this this calculation and it changes the numbers but what we saw last week was 262 000 filing for unemployment Just 4 000 people difference and to me that's now saying okay it's probably not an outlier you're beginning to see the effects of people getting laid off and filing for unemployment so that would be one thing um you know a\n",

      "for unemployment and what I was saying is last week to really watch the next number because sometimes you get these outliers you know that could the data changes this this calculation and it changes the numbers but what we saw last week was 262 000 filing for unemployment Just 4 000 people difference and to me that's now saying okay it's probably not an outlier you're beginning to see the effects of people getting laid off and filing for unemployment so that would be one thing um you know a couple other things I'm seeing here U.S delinquency rates on credit cards are now rising at their fastest Pace since 2008 right so so now it's not at the level right so the the rate of change is rising right that's that's what it's equal to but you're not at those levels in fact I'm going to show my screen here this is a David Lynn courtesy of David Lynn um and let me just throw mine in here so here's your here's his his tweet and I I by the way if you if you don't follow him he's he's awesome at his data he's a great interviewer and and so forth so definitely look to follow him but U.S delinquency rates on credit cards now rising at their fastest Pace since 08 although still nowhere near 08 levels so so here you have the the the the drive higher is is essentially at that same rate but you're still far below so what that tells me is that people are still able to do their thing even though the delinquencies are rising substantially and then this one's kind of interesting as well which says credit card debt now at all-time highs and the reason why this is important in terms of credit card debt is because at all time highs if people stop paying their credit cards it's a big bigger deal to Banks right so you know if if if you don't pay your credit card and you own 10 you owe ten dollars to the bank okay but if you own a thousand dollars and there's a million people that owe a thousand now it becomes a bigger issue and being at all-time highs is definitely unsustainable in the long run the other thing too to just mention is I flip back to charts is that um I also read that bankruptcies are now at their highest level since I believe 2011. now it's not at 2008 2009 levels but you're seeing again this shift so so for me at least as an investor in stocks in gold and in crypto it's kind of the yellow light you know you're not seeing the red flashing like holy cow we're going down with the ship but you're seeing like okay there is a change going on here and then the bigger question to bring back to is whether or not inflation does inflation go back to two percent or under for the fed or do they get it themselves in a pickle where we stick it three percent and it makes it very hard for them to bail us out whenever that that big downturn comes I think there is a definitely a risk here of of going in to rap or I don't know I don't know how rapid it would be but I think the bigger risk is rapid disinflation um if because of just how hawkish the FED has been for so long because again normally it takes them it takes what a year for these for rate hikes to really filter through the economy so there's a chance so they've already gone you know further than they needed to um to accomplish getting getting getting inflation back down I think the big the biggest issue is that they don't want to repeat the same mistakes from the 70s where they flip-flop every every couple of years and you're right that's a worst case scenario I think right like if we if they go back to QE too quickly then we're basically gonna we could go into an environment where you know the s p maybe puts in a new high but only in only in nominal terms not in real terms and then we could also go into an environment where it puts in new lows for the better part of a decade right a new high and a new low and a new high a new low that's what we did on 70s and I think there's a risk to that Garrett there's also another chart that I thought was interesting and I you know the the whole labor market and I think this can help us you know kind of understand where you know why why the unemployment rate hasn't really moved despite all the layoffs that we've seen is if you look at job openings right like these are total non-farm arguably all the losses that we've seen are just more or less getting us back to Trend right I mean this is an entire Trend I think that where where's the issue is what happens if we go below the prior Trend like we did back over here in 2020 right if we go below the prior Trend that's where I think you can get a lot a lot more issues and the the other thing too is that if you look at things like real GDP right we did of course have two consecutive quarters of negative real G of real GDP that were negative back in in 2022 there's also um uh gross domestic income and one of the metrics that some economists follow is the average of GDP and GDI and if you would and if you adjust that for inflation and look at a quarter over quarter change we've actually been putting in some negative prints here um and and with another way to look at this too I think is to look at a year-over-year change and when you look at it like this you can see that I mean I don't know that it has a Miss hit here I mean it seems like every time the year-over-year percentage change of this average goes negative that's what marks a recession right and I mean right now we're still slightly positive right we are still slightly positive we're we're just like we're right on the brink but the economy hasn't thrown in the towel just yet right so we just continue to climb the wall of worry until we have reason not to do so I'm curious what is your view here on the S P 500 in terms of climbing the wall of worry and and do you think it will eventually break to the downside yeah so so and and this is a great Point too is so just first of all going back to the Federal Reserve I think it's important and I've seen this kind of this narrative get lost but it was around three six months ago which is that the Federal Reserve has never really engineered a soft Landing right I mean and again so so I think the market right now is like oh they're going to do it this time you know it's almost like you're rooting for your team but they they just they they haven't won the championship any past year but you just like you just willing to believe leave because we all want to believe right I mean we want to believe that everything's going to turn out good that's that's human nature to want to believe that so so I think a couple things to look at here going back to um my chart here I apologize let me add my mind to the stream here uh is that number one take a look at interest rates and remember the FED basically came out and said we're gonna have to hike more this year and the market was like ha dream on we don't believe you at all I mean literally the market like was like nope we don't believe you but if you look at the 10-year yield this is a very interesting pattern this is actually a bullish channel of consolidation on the 10-year and if it breaks Above This 3.9 level you're at least going back to 4.3 and potentially higher and again the question then is how does that affect the overall stock market um the other side of the coin too is you can see that we've been holding these these are two parallel lines you can connect these lows here and it's perfectly parallel as well so there's a lot of support down here and you have this bullish channel that again eventually bullish when you have a downsloping channel the thought process is eventually price breaks out to the upside you don't necessarily know when but downsloping channels break out to the upside so so if that does happen that puts me in a position where if we look at the S P 500 you have to wonder okay well are we going to get to all-time highs and if we get to all-time highs is it on this hopium and again markets can do that in light volume summer months we can continue to Rally I mean it's it's clear as day that we've been doing that right now with the the narratives that have been pushing about this Perfect Landing but again for me this is a this is a situation where I would not personally feel comfortable buying an Apple at all-time highs Microsoft at all-time highs and by the way I mean Microsoft last week all-time all-time Highs but look it had a pretty nasty reversal right off that double top right there um one thing to just show on the NASDAQ on the QQQ chart is that there's a major there's some major confluences of trend lines right in this area so I'm a big fan of channels and how channels for some reason human nature is to make you know you know factors or or re you know structure out of chaos and if you connect the the lows here on the NASDAQ going back to 2021 and it connects perfectly through here 2022 late in 20 22 and right here in early 2023 and you drag a parallel up to the all-time highs you actually get this pivot this pivot and then where we are currently there then if you look at this High which was just before the covid collapse the highest point on the market before the covid collapse it connects perfectly through that high these lows here then this low we broke below it and then we retraced to it and then look at where we are we're right in that midst right here as well so so at least from me again you know the one thing the market has a tendency to kind of make you question yourself make you almost want to flip it makes most people flip from bullish to bearish or bearish to bullish just before it flips the other way but the charts are the charts and there's some major signals to me that that were probably closer to the end of this run in the s p than not as well as the NASDAQ I feel like the um what's the saying like the uh the path to us uh the path to a hard Landing always goes through thinking we get a soft Landing first right you can go through that process of thinking we get a soft Landing anytime you get to a hard Landing um there's there's a couple of things I mean I I am in general agreement with you about about you know where where the equity markets are headed one thing I we kind of talked a little bit about last week if you look at say like the S P 500 on like longer time frames like say like you know we had uh we had a bearish period in 2014 and I I think there's some seasonality to this too I I think historically uh pre-election years are tend to be good years for the stock market so like it's fighting that bias I guess where like 2019 we climbed the wall of worry 2015 I think there was some element of climbing the wall of worry and what what I've noticed here if you look at the chart is that you know the s p found a low in sort of the second half of 2014 and it then kind of retested that that low or maybe even a slightly lower low in early 2016 right so like you know maybe a little over a year later right because this was the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2016. then you have with the s p you had another bear Market here at the end of 2018. I don't know if you want to call it a bear Market it was a correction at least and then again we took out that low right about the same time frame later right in early 2020 um where we put in a new low and so this is still same thing right like you put in a low the second half of 2022 we climbed the wall of worry in the pre-election year but you still have right the inverted yield curve that we had back over here and there are some issues and there's there's something else Garrett that I thought was kind of interesting if you look really closely at the s p this pattern is is actually really similar right so like coming out of this low here and this low here we sort of had our our first our first move higher second move higher and then sort of like a brief pullback before the final rally into the situation right so you're kind of seeing the same thing right you got one rally you got two rallies you got sort of a very brief pullback I almost wonder if we're in that final you know that final stage of of melt up before I before it actually goes down but one thing that I I mentioned as well is you know with the s p it in both of those prior Cycles I think it did put in new lows but only barely but where what's more interesting is the Russell and and I wanted to draw this out because the Russell actually has got put in significantly further lows right and this cycle back over here was another 10 down 2018 to 2020 2018 to 2020 was another 25 down and it kind of goes back to that idea of like you know the the higher risk stuff like the the high and the weather you no matter what asset class thing you have right whether it's equities whether it's cryptocurrency or maybe even you're talking about Commodities too but it's that higher risk off that that can get that can get hit a lot harder and if this pattern plays out you could see a new low on the Russell sometime in early 2024. yeah it's fascinating man it really is and I I love the stuff where where you know unless some people I saw a comment in there like you know these guys are talking about the 70s how old they are but I think it's important for people to Remember by the way I wasn't born in the 70s I'm 1980 baby and I think you're you're even younger right I'm a 90s kid yeah yeah so so but but one thing that Ben and I do understand is that history may not perfectly repeat but it tends to rhyme and it Rhymes because human nature never changes right you go back to ancient Egypt people were still greedy and they still got fearful you go back to even you know when it when it was you know living in caves people got greedy and they got fearful right and so it makes sense that you can learn a lot from history um so so just something to kind of think about there now I want to show you this chart here so this is the NASDAQ and and I love showing this right so the NASDAQ chart um from the highs it dropped about 38 percent and what we can see here is that we've rallied 37.2 percent back up now a lot of people the 37 back up makes you feel like you're in a bull market but what I like to show people is that if you go back historically to these past Cycles right so let's even go back to the.com Bubble okay and let me erase that to keep it clean but we actually had a drop in the.com bubble of about 41 and a 41 rally back up all right so now okay so that was the.com bubble and this is the this is the NASDAQ you know two two factors don't make a trend but then flip it over here let's go back to 1929 and 1930 the Great Depression right well take a look at the Great Depression you dropped 50 percent which was in there was the 1929 crash and then you rallied back 52 percent before mind you take a look at this before price ended up going down and again I mean 85 percent from that high right so so again does it mean that this is a hundred percent the way this cycle is going to play out no not at all but it's important to recognize that even in Bitcoin you have big rallies in Bear markets big rallies to the upside and you can still will go and be in a bear market and again I love showing that especially the 1929-1930 period because you know needless to say that was so long ago but it was the Great Depression and and again I want to be clear I'm not calling for a Great Depression here there's nothing in my charts that are saying it's inevitable that we're going to be in a great depression but it's again showcasing how human behavior tends to repeat over and over again I think yeah I'm not I'm not in the depression Camp I'm more in a recession Camp um and and also too like that if we don't get a recession that might actually be worse for the economy I recessions are actually really good for for getting out the excess and making us all more productive you know it's not I and I think they also create a lot of opportunities for people they shouldn't be something that we fear they should be something that investors look forward to you know you just were looking at those charts if you if you flip it over to my screen right here I I'd like to show uh actually just comparing all the prior bear markets um so this one actually so the blue line here is is the current one and then this is this is assuming the low's not in right I mean if the low is in then you argue that the bear Market you know ended back in October but if the low is not in then as a function of time this bear Market has outperformed the primary markets going as a function of time going all the way back to the 19 uh to the Great Depression in fact um but there's some cool things that we can look at here if we pull up say the I believe it's the um one of these if you look at like the 1956 to 1957 bear Market it it pulled back like 20 before rallying to a almost almost a new high and then still capitulating in at the end right um and there's actually a lot of a lot of Market cycles that do that where you know you'll get these these pretty big rallies that can last for months this is the.com crash this is a financial crisis and then this is the current the current one right you'll get these rallies that can really test your conviction about things um but it doesn't necessarily mean that the the below the rent look at the look at this one from 1946 to 1949. like look at this bear market and how wow put in a low this was coming out of World War II and I actually think that there are reasons to look at at what happened from 1946 to 1949 because I know that we're not really it's not like we're coming out of a World War but we are coming out of a period of where a lot of money was printed and so there's also a lot of money printed in a war um that's an amazing point is that while it wasn't a world War what happened in in the in in the world war the the U.S had to spend a ton and ton a ton of money right and then you look at covet and the effects of how much money had to be spent right so like if you look at so the blue line is the current cycle and then the lighter blue line is the is coming out of World War II I mean there was pretty impressive rallies back then too and it still eventually put in a new low um you know 1100 days into the bear market right and for reference we're currently about halfway we're about that the halfway point compared to that level wow right so I mean it really does show you how long the business cycle can take to to play out sometimes and and by the way if you if you think about where where this would take us like if if it's only a slightly new low um and it's not a massive new low that would correspond to a I know a Target that you've pretty uh you've recently talked about as well and that was that sort of that pre-pandemic high of around 3 400 like 3 300 to 3 400. so if if we if we follow that pattern then I mean we could still get there it could take another six months it could take 12 months now I think the thing is is no matter no matter what happens tomorrow or next month it doesn't mean that a year from now or eight months from now it can't happen you know um and I think that's the hardest thing is understanding that the business cycle can just take a long time to play out and until the unemployment rate goes up I I think the fed's gonna they're gonna stay at it until the unemployment rate goes up and it's not until the unemployment rate goes up that you you'll start to find those final lows yeah I think that's true and I think the FED it's funny because I think the FED is feeling uh their lack of you know people's lack of trust in them right I think I think when Jerome Powell came out last was it last Wednesday with the fomc statement and the markets initially dumped out when it was like oh we're gonna still hike I think it was about 66 of the board of of the Federal Reserve said we're going to do two to three more hikes in the year and the Market's initially sold off and then the markets Shrugged it off and rallied up the next couple days and it's it's really saying all right you know\n",

      "you know people's lack of trust in them right I think I think when Jerome Powell came out last was it last Wednesday with the fomc statement and the markets initially dumped out when it was like oh we're gonna still hike I think it was about 66 of the board of of the Federal Reserve said we're going to do two to three more hikes in the year and the Market's initially sold off and then the markets Shrugged it off and rallied up the next couple days and it's it's really saying all right you know you can tell us you're going to hike we just don't believe you we don't believe that the FED will ever step fully away from the punch bowl um or the money printer and and it's a credibility issue at this point and then the question is as the markets go higher and and granted this isn't for crypto but there's a wealth effect that adds to inflation right so you know I always tell people this is they say well why is if the stock market goes up does it potentially add to inflation and the concept is that if you look at your 401k and it was 200 000 yesterday and let's just say it's 400 000 today and you were kind of thinking about a new car or a new TV you're much more likely to say yeah let me go buy that new car new TV because look at my 401k it's up massively and so so that's the the reason why the FED is more focused on the stock market and wanting it to come down but right now they've lost that credibility what's your view on the real estate market because that's something that like I know I don't I don't really talk about a whole lot and I'm not really sure what your experience and it is I don't have really any real world experience in the um in the real estate market I have personal real estate or I have real estate for personal use but nothing for like commercial use I'm curious what your view is on that because that that sort of seems like one of those things that could be like uh like like something that's going to happen in the next few years that will and going back to what you were talking about like the wealth effect right if if housing comes down I imagine that would affect markets I'm I'm wondering if we could see something like you know where we get out to like 2025 or something and and we're also you know a lot of people get bullish again and then maybe that's what brings us back down um in a in a future cycle I'm curious what you think yeah so so for me it's it's and by the way you know you talk to some of the biggest people in real estate and they'll tell you there's two things they'll tell you number one the commercial real estate is absolutely screwed um banks are carrying their you know zomb they're almost zombie banks at this point because they're carrying so many bad loans I mean almost every day I don't know if you've heard this but out of California it's like okay this company packed up and stopped paying paying for their big office building in California and it's just this Exodus because people people number one aren't fully going back to work and number two there's just this yeah there's this this this it was this overabundance of of real estate that was built for commercial now the other side is you can almost find no one that's saying the real estate Market's going to come down for for retail people right the the commercial not the commercial the residential and I can't believe that narrative like if you tell me that you know so number one housing prices are are at all-time Highs are just off of all-time highs so the affordability if you look at the affordability numbers it's ridiculous how unaffordable it is to most Americans then you say okay well most Americans can't put you know if a house is 500 000 most people don't have 20 to put down so they're going to have to take out a loan for majority of that this 30-year loan is now seven percent or something that's a massive undertaking on a basis now remember just in the the the debt ceiling stuff people are going to have to start paying their their student loans again that was one of the things that got taken away is the the the the non-payment of those student loans so people are going to have 2 to 300 payments every month now you're talking about houses that are already unaffordable and now seven percent interest rates so it's and by the way we're not even talking about if people start losing their jobs what happens then you know how does affordability change with people losing their jobs if the unemployment rate just goes to five percent let's say so so I think you know for me one of and I'll show you I'll show you this chart here is this is the kbh chart KB Homes and it has been on an amazing move and I I have shorted this right I am short right now part of its chart basis right you got this beautiful little kind of double top up here but the other side of it is is that I'm just not a believer in the narrative that so many big names are spinning that that home prices are just going to stay where they are or continue to go higher now the reason why they're saying that is because there's so much demand but you know a lot of that demand You could argue is coming from airbnbs right there's so many people so many people bought multiple homes to use as airbnbs and if the economy does weaken how many of those number one do they stop paying their loans on them because the thought process was okay I have an Airbnb as long as I can rent it out two times a month I can pay that loan with that profit that I'm making well let's just say the economy does go south which is what the fed's trying to do and you can't pay that anymore are you really going to keep up three payments you know on homes your own home and two others that were airbnbs no and then so you get those to come on the market and I think you could see a massive inflow of new homes on the market if the economy does weaken but that that process I mean I guess the real estate market it's a it's a very slow-moving uh asset yes right so even if it even if it does start moving in that direction I mean it could still be a multi-year process right yes yes and it would be I mean again you know what's interesting is the 2007 I mean if things started to unravel in 2007. that was actually very very quick but we didn't really see like at least in Florida where I am the recovery didn't really start until 2014. uh 2013 to 2014. so so that was one of the quicker scenarios because it was a financial crisis where you had these Banks collapsing and people really just started running away I do think that this one will be a longer scenario where it could be as late as 2025 to 2026 before we see significant discounts I think I think you're already seeing like like the home I own it's gone down a little bit in value on Zillow but it's nothing significant at this point yet okay yeah I mean some of the some of the places that I've looked at recently have haven't really moved a whole lot there's just not there's not like there's just no inventory I think is the issue but I guess the problem is as well you know if if the economy does turn then people might be forced to sell and I think that's kind of where I am on it where where if if the economy turns and you don't see people you know booking airbnbs non-stop does that then start a new process of dumping properties on the open market to try to offload them well it's kind of like I mean I guess it's kind of like any market right I mean you know capitulations happen when people are forced to sell right and they're they're leveraged beyond what they can imagine and they're they're forced to continue that's not that they want to it's not that they think the asset class will never recover it's just they have to they have to sell yeah and here in Florida I mean I could just speak like in my neighborhood my neighborhood's made up of 11 homes there's just an 11 home Community there's three homes that have been up for sale now for months and they've had to drop the prices and still no one's bought now these homes are multi-million dollar homes so it's not like it's it's John Q Publix that'll be able to afford them but it does speak to prices price Cuts starting you know it's it what I would refer to it is you're in the first inning of a nine-inning baseball game right it's the very preliminary first pitch kind of stuff coming out right now you know we've talked about we talked about the stock market we talked about crypto we talked about some prodities we talked about real estate maybe the last thing I want to maybe we could just very touch briefly touch on them we should maybe wrap it up as yeah I'm curious what your view is on on some of these bonds like it like things like um like TLT you know I know I know a lot of times people use these things as uh as downside protection and I'm I'm I'm tempted to do so and my plan has been to get some but I'm also like I've also been very cautious because there's there's part of me that thinks and the reason I'm thinking about this is because you talked you were talking about the 10-year yield earlier and if if long-term treasury like if the 10-year and the 30 are going up and that means TLT is going down and so I'm curious but but I guess the counterpoints is that they can provide a hedge in case the economy just completely goes to crap in the short term and the fed's forced to cut rates so like from a technical perspective like what what are you looking at on on TLT because I I could I could make the case either way I think yeah I know and that's where I am too I'm in this position where I'm like okay well well if the economy is going to weaken how our rate's going to go up but then when you we looked at the 10-year chart the 10-year did look like it was potentially getting ready to break out looking at the TLT here you had this long-term downtrend and then you kind of have gotten into this very tight range right and so so for me it's more at least on the TLT the way I look at it is like okay you have a range here and it stayed within this range whichever way it breaks that's probably just like the Bitcoin dominance chart right when it breaks at some point you probably get a bigger move out of it so so for me it's kind of watching this low end this 99 and a half to 100 level if we break below that then honestly you're probably testing these lows down here if we come up to the highs and break out then then this is uh and by the way this is kind of an inverse so the TLT is like an inverse right so so if rates go up this goes down and if rates go down this goes up just so people that are watching understand the the metrics of it but but yeah I mean right now I mean the one thing you can say is that rates have been held in a pretty tight range for actually a long time yeah well I was thinking too because like I mean the FED doesn't always control the long end of the curve anyways I mean that can also be more so anticipating what's going to happen you know I mean if inflation expectations are changing long term of course that will affect uh like some of these some of these long-term rates but that was something that I've I've been thinking about getting a position in I haven't you know I've been kind of cautious because I'm like well I mean the fed's gone they've raised rates so much but I mean at this point while it seems like things are heading in the wrong direction the economy is kind of like hanging on by a threat you know yeah so what are your thoughts about the inversion of the yield curve before we wrap things up I'm just curious because we've seen a pretty significant inversion yeah so let me um let me pull up pull that up because I I have uh so you're talking about the inverted yield curve but one I mean I can briefly pull up the yield curve can you see my screen here yep yeah so I mean look we have an inverted yield curve uh normally when you go back in time you can see like we have inverted yield curves just before recessions right I mean this was this was the this is what the yield curve looked like back in 2007 uh early 2007 by the way and and things didn't really get bad in the economy until later on in 2008 2009 same thing occurred of course before the.com crash we got into an inverted yield curve as well and we know what happened after that and that's where we are again today um I I think the the way I like to view this though is to look at the spreads and so like this is the spread on the three month and the 10-year and as you said Gareth I mean we haven't really seen this before at least not since like the 1980s the 1970s also during a period of high inflation one of the things that I I think people will often point to is like oh we have an inverted yield curve that means we have a recession but in reality you know if you were to only tell me like if you were to say hey Ben in 50 years we're gonna we're gonna go inverted do you think we're in a recession or not I would say well we're probably not in a recession once it inverts but upon the uninversion we could go into a reset right it's normally upon the uninversion of the yield curve where you go into a recession as you can see over here in the 19 late 1980s we got a an invertible curve at uninverted recession right and then in the 2000s inverted inverted the old curve uninversion recession and then again in 2006 2007 right and inverted yield curve an inversion recession now I do think and even in 2019-2020 I do think there is a chance that we could go into a recession before the yield curve uninverts but I don't know that that would be my base case the only reason I say that there's a chance is because even over here in the 1980s we had some you know some um periods where it was slightly inverted and we were in a recession I think the case to be made for that is during periods of high inflation the FED is forced to remain hawkish longer than they otherwise would have therefore you could go into a recession before before we go back to to you know healthier rates yeah exactly now is is there is the inversion historically that we're seeing now and I don't know if you know this but is this is this like is there are there past periods in history where where it's been this or greater an inversion so I mean on my chart I'm only going back here to like 1981 and and you can see where we are right now it is more and it has been more inverted than that this is the spread on the three month and the ten year I can switch this to the two year and the ten year and it if you look at the two year in the 10-year inversion we've actually have been more inverted in the past if you look at the 1980s you can see that it was even more inverted uh than it is right now also note though than the 1980s we actually got two recessions more or less back to back I think that was when volcker finally knew what needed to be done you know after after they spent 10 years um you know in Burns and they spent basically 10 years doing what they wanted doing what they felt for or pressured to do rather than what they needed to do then in the 1980s they finally were like all right we just need to do this until inflation comes back down and it it came on the back of two recessions um and you can see here that during that period we actually had a recession before we had the uninversion of the two year in the tenure yeah um and in both cases so I think there is a case to be made that we could see a recession before the uninversion process starts mainly because we're comparing it to Prior periods of high inflation um but something that I think we always need to remember especially uh in the future as well is that when it inverts it's not normally a sign of a recession right it's a sign that a recession might come within the next year or two yep yeah for sure for sure wow amazing information guys and I I see the comments you guys loving the information and and I think that's that's yeah that's what we're here for is to kind of get away from the crap that people see in social media and that get get you know Sway and listen we're just presenting different things and kind of our thoughts and then you guys can really take the information and go with it and I think the first thing I'll say is that you know while I don't project out new all-time highs on the stock market it doesn't mean that it won't happen um I say that Bitcoin might make a low at 12 000 or break fifteen seven that's my perspective doesn't mean it's going to happen so the key is is all we can do is look at the data and use the data to make informed decisions and and I think that's what the no-shill zone is all about so um we'll wrap it up there Ben do you want to leave any do you want to do you want to talk about your your website anything you know to give people a little heads up that they maybe don't know you that that know me more yeah we have a website with all these charts so um you can get access um into thecubedivers.com and I know Gareth Garrett we provide very different perspectives because I I'm more I think I'm more passive but Gareth is a lot more active in investing than I am so I think there's a lot of people that that might also on my channel would like to hear what you're what you're doing over there on your end yeah absolutely and again you know I basically I'm a swing Trader so I'm going long I'm going short um in stocks Commodities and in crypto although I will say that the crypto service is is there's not a lot of trades right now it's it's all crypto follows Bitcoin generally although we've seen that Divergence with the all coin so so again it's it's it's being patient it's being disciplined and letting the charts dictate and the data dictate the move so so yeah it's wonderful thank you guys for tuning in I mean amazing how many people live watching this live that really warms our hearts and um we will be back next Monday um to do it again for you guys so spread the word if you guys could follow us on follow both of us on Twitter on YouTube share this stream to your friends if you think they would find it useful I'd love us to get to 5 000 live viewers next next week from the 37 3800 that we had today all right you guys have a wonderful one thank you all have a great one take care Ben thank you\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about ethereum and we're going to be looking at a logarithmic regression bands if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptiverse premium at into the cryptiverse.com let's go ahead and jump in so we we did provide an update to ethereum not too long ago but in that video we mostly spoke about the ethereum Bitcoin evaluation which to me is is a much more important metric to look at right and we talked we it was like a 30 minute video we talked about How likely that this was just a fake out and nothing more than a lower high and how that is the more relevant metric to look at and I will stand by looking at valuations of these cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin is the best way to do so is the best way to go about uh the cryptiverse okay my mind cannot be compelled to change on that because it's all about opportunity cost with that said um I you know I can understand why some people would prefer to talk about their USD evaluations and it it can be useful to better understand uh likely outcomes as as the market cycle progresses so I do want to spend this video mostly talking about the USD evaluation of ethereum over the Bitcoin valuation of ethereum that we spoke about just a few you know just a few days ago so there's this idea that we've had for a long time and that's you know that we can fit a logarithmic regression band to ethereum's price data but to choose that data based on what we think is considered to be quote-unquote non-bubble data so it is somewhat discretionary as to what someone might deem to be in fact non-bubble data for instance there will be a lot of people and I'm not saying they're wrong right there will be a lot of people that would argue that this here should be included in this logarithmic regression trend line fit and if you did that of course it would shift this just subtly upwards I think the issue that I have with that is that normally when you go from one cycle to another you have to adjust the regression band not not you know to the upside but to the downside normally to give you an example of what I'm talking about if we were to pull up Bitcoin so if we were to pull up bitcoin's logarithmic regression trend line and let me just go ahead and do that really quick you will see that we actually dropped below it this cycle now you might think that oh well does that mean that ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin uh you know since late 2021 and actually that's not true um Bitcoin has has actually held its value better than ethereum uh from from the high to the low okay so ethereum went down about uh 82 percent Bitcoin went down about 77 okay so from that perspective even though Bitcoin went below its regression ban ethereum actually dropped more and so at this point and note that I I probably should update this regression band relatively soon basically because there was this deviation outside of it of course we have had deviations outside of it before and and I haven't I haven't updated it yet but normally I wouldn't expect to update a regression ban because it outperformed it's more so because it would it would underperform okay now I know some people just think that I'm being too stingy with my V1 ethereum that I should just get with the times and look they might they might have a point but at this point I cannot yet be compelled to change my view a figuring Bitcoin valuation has continued to play out how we thought that it would and given that we know that the prehabbing years wreck both the Bulls and the Bears right we wreck both sides in the pre-halving years we just spent January February March and April wrecking the Bears may we wrecked the Bulls June it remains to be seen but I would still argue there's you know plenty of months throughout the the rest of this year where we can uh wreck the Bulls probably a couple where we wreck the Bears as well just to get it in line about six and six or so but at this point I still think that because Bitcoin has direct both sides before the year is out and because the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is what and what I would consider to be a downtrend right just putting in lower highs for a long time that there is still a a very high risk here of us going back to the fair value logarithmic regression trend line now an interesting development is that the fair value according to this fit to non-bubble data of ethereum is at 875 but the prior low was actually at 880. so they're essentially the same if if if ethereum went back down to its prior low that would get it back home and we talked about this a year ago right I said look guys what I think is going to happen is we either go down to the regression band or we go sideways until it catches up now if we were to dump now it would actually be if we were to dump to the what I've called home before right it would actually correspond to the prior low that doesn't mean that you can't go below that level as you can see we did go entirely below the entire regression band back in March of 2020 and in fact it went about 34 below the regression band during that drop if we were to have another drop similar to that like 34 below this level that would correspond down to about a 400 ethereum which is why I've thrown that number out there in the past as a a potential outcome in sort of like a a worst case scenario environment or something or like around that level plus or minus 100 right it could be could be a little bit higher uh could be lower right but that would be sort of a a worst case um outcome that I I would I would consider so at this point the band ranges from 604 at the low end to 1266 at the high end right now ethereum is coming in right around Seventeen hundred dollars so we are still quite a bit a ways away from entering into the regression band right the ethereum valuation would need to drop about 24 percent or so for us to just get back down to the fair value logarithmic regression trend line I I would also say too that when you look at at ethereum and you you take a look at you know how it tends to perform in say the the pre having year uh looking at say year-to-date Roi could be one way um to go about trying to figure out you know how would likely how would ethereum likely perform during the you know during the second half of a of a prehabbing year it's not loading at the moment but maybe if I reloaded it a load I'll leave that for a minute and I'll come back to it but normally what you would expect normally right we don't really have a ton of data points but um we saw this in 2019 where it rallied for half the year and then it sort of faded uh you know after that and and if we were to look at at it for Bitcoin you'll remember that in 2019 Bitcoin had a positive year whereas ethereum did not and ethereum actually closed the year below its yearly open now this is what it looks like for 2023 so far the yearly open for ethereum if you're curious if we were to go figure out what exactly the yearly open was um it was 11.95 so if it wants to follow the ghost of 2019 then that means that ethereum could in fact close the year below 11.95 which I mean I know that sounds um like a big drop but it's actually not that large of a drop from the current valuations I mean you know I mean we're currently already at around 1700 and and so you know to get back to that level you're talking about you know a 30 drop I mean it can happen right I mean it certainly can't happen um so I do think there is a case to be made that ethereum would in fact revisit its lower logarithmic regression trend line okay now there's another logarithmic regression chart that we can look at and that sort of this logarithmic regression rainbow and we've had this one for a long time too you can actually see that in 2019 uh we came up to the top of this gray band which is kind of the same spot we just went to uh during this during this prehabbing year as well for Bitcoin um do note though that after it tagged that in 2019 in July June July we then faded it uh basically until early the next year so I would still say yeah there is certainly a chance here that it just kind of Fades back down into the fair value logarithmic regression trend line the other way to view this is to not look at the year-to-date Roi but to actually look at the ROI after after the peak because that can tell you some interesting stuff as well and if you look at it for ethereum and draw it out to the next Peak but just sort of look at what happened in 2019 you can see that it came down or sorry 2018 it came down and then it rallied and then it sort of faded again in the second half of the year I think we're probably in this fade period where it doesn't mean that you're not going to have some rallies back up right in fact we probably will right and there's no there's no reason that you can't see Bitcoin and ethereum rally five to ten percent occasionally right that would actually be fairly normal and expected but arguably we have just been putting in lower highs um you know since since about mid April okay and one of the things I've said before as well with regards to you know to to bitcoin is that we need to see the dominance get back to around that 60 level one way for it to do that is for in a downtrend which at least it is in right now I mean market conditions can change but it's been in a downtrend since mid-april um these rallies have a way of shaking off the altcoin market on their Bitcoin Pairs and also ethereum and you can see that's playing out right now you know again right I mean like ethereum's Bitcoin valuation is is down below 0.065 even though Bitcoin is up so let's just let's just remember that ethereum does tend to fade when Bitcoin is below its 20 week estimate and again right now Bitcoin is only just below it maybe we'll get a weekly close back above it uh we're we're still above the 21 with EMA but we are in fact below still the 20-week estimate we need to get back above I mean we're almost there right we need to get back above around 26 000 329 um for us to be back about the 20 week estimate but you would also need to see yearly closes uh back above that level as well or not yearly closes weekly closes about back above that level as well for it to be um important okay so my view on ethereum um is that it likely Fades going into the back half of the air we've talked about this many many times okay this should not be news to anyone um and that ideally ideally it would eventually return home before we we actually gear up for a a real bull market to to potentially take us to new highs um I only say that because this is what we've seen in the past doesn't mean that it has to happen but you know back in 2019 when we were up here I didn't think we were going to go all the way back down here and we did and it was in fact a 75 correction now a 75 correction from this level for ethereum would actually get it down to around 500 it doesn't have to be that I mean again if you if you look at this initial Drop It was 95 so it was 95 and then 75 this one was about you know 80 82 so perhaps if it does fade in the second half of the year and our thesis is correct maybe it only Fades 60 and gets you down to 840 or maybe it's like 65 percent it gets you down to 739 or maybe it's 70 and gets you down to 622. right there's obviously a lot of different things we could consider but these are these are the things that I'm currently looking at if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up but again check out the sale on into the

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about cardano and its native token Ada if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the crypto versus premium add into the cryptiverse.com we've talked about this idea of searching for a cycle bottom for quite a long period of time and as you guys are aware and I've made very clear uh that throughout a bear Market year and a prehabbing year and even the early stages of a having year for Bitcoin that all coins can and will likely continue to bleed that has been something that we've talked about for a long time and recently Ada actually went in and put in a new low in fact so the prior low I mean it was wasn't much lower right but the prior low was about 0.239 and last week we went down to about 0.220 so as you can see right like this is clear evidence that all coins can put in new lows even if Bitcoin isn't right I mean like Bitcoin is nowhere close to its prior low of fifteen four fifteen thousand four hundred yet you have all coins putting in new lows and it's not to just pick on Ada there's plenty of all coins that are putting in new lows as well polka dot chain link Avalanche list goes on and on and on right there's plenty of all coins that are in fact putting in new lows but it just goes to show you how the altcoin market can get wrecked for much longer than people think it can now just because you know it's down here on its USD pair two levels that we saw back in December there are some reasons to still be cautious primarily because of its Bitcoin valuation we've talked about this as well right the the important aspect to look at is the Bitcoin valuation not the USD evaluation to remind you we've put out a few videos on on Ada Bitcoin and the whole idea is is that it would likely go down to around this 400 Satoshi level right this was back uh when it was closer to 2000 satoshi's and I mean here's another one as well when it was around 2000 satoshi's as well and just provide an update to this right I mean you can see in fact that it is more or less following what we would have suggested that it would have right like that it would ebb and flow it's an oscillator at best I think and it sort of Ebbs and flows from one into the Spectrum to the other and when you're up here no one ever thinks you're going to go down here and when you're down here no one ever thinks you're going to go back the other way um and if you go look at Ada Bitcoin today you know it has fallen down to around a thousand satoshi's and in the most recent Wick it went down to about 851. I previously said that this summer I thought we would see Ada go down to around that 800 Satoshi level and now we have more or less hit that level as we went down to around 851 satoshi's now crypto is very cyclical we must remember that it's very cyclical would you care to guess where the Ada Bitcoin valuation was exactly four years ago where was the Ada Bitcoin valuation exactly four years ago well it's the week of June 12th the week of June 12th the week of June 12th back over here around there June 10th we were right around a thousand satoshi's guys I mean this is basically just right out of the Playbook we are at the same valuation then and for Reference last cycle I learned my lesson because last cycle I I actually bought Ada um back over here I thought I was a genius you know and this was in Q3 of 2018 and that's why this time like this time when we got to Q3 of 2022 I said guys like I thought like I would have thought that was the low back in the last cycle too but it wasn't and we ended up going down at the end of the year furthermore even though Bitcoin bottomed in 2018 Ada did not and it actually went and put in a new low in March of 2020. now you might say well that was just because of a Black Swan event guys we still had an inverted yield curve back then just like we do today it just tells you the economy's sick and also letting us have one more thing to sort of push it over the edge so we saw that ADA rallied from December for about half the year and then it sort of just faded rally into a recession and then plummet right I I think that you could argue that we've sort of done this first part right rally for the first part of the year we've come back we could be going lower as well but we have to come back down some at some point we could still see it go even lower as it slowly bleeds back to bitcoin okay now the one thing that we've talked about a lot about is the Bitcoin dominance and how you can use the Bitcoin dominance to better understand when all coins are are are theoretically worth the risk or theoretically not worth risking it's not Financial advice but you can use the Bitcoin dominance to give you some insight into that and I will say right like it should be no coincidence that it was basically once Bitcoin broke the Range High right here where a lot of people are throwing in the towel on the altcoin market because they're now saying it's dead and then it'll never recover we know I mean just from prior experience when Bitcoin dominance breaks the Range High that is the narrative that will prevail usually for you know for several months right that that the altcoin market will likely just continue to bleed against Bitcoin and I think it probably will I mean you know I I I suspect that the Ada Bitcoin valuation needs to come back down to around 400 satoshi's eventually and if you think that's crazy we also called for 800 satoshi's this summer and a lot there's a lot of pushback on that idea and yet now you can see just how quickly we went down to that 800 and Sochi level as the Bitcoin dominance broke the Range High okay the problem is that normally once the dominance breaks the Range High it then continues to rally for a while right like it doesn't just stop there it should continue to rally for a while to the detriment of all coins on their Bitcoin pairs okay so then the general expectation is that at some point the Ada Bitcoin valuation could in fact fall all the way down here that's not to say that it has to happen tomorrow or next week it could stay like at these levels for quite a while before it falls back down I don't know I do know that back over here when it fell it fell pretty quickly but that's not to say that it has to fall as quickly this time last time we were at eight we were at around a thousand satoshi's in June and then by August we were out 400 Satoshi so if in two months eight is at 400 satoshi's you know if the Ada Bitcoin valuation is a 400 satoshi's and it's basically the same thing that happened last cycle um think about how this chart we've had this chart drawn on here forever right Q3 2023 we are getting pretty close Q3 starts next month so um we'll keep an eye on this because it has been playing out more or less how we thought that it would and it's just a matter of does it you know does it does it find some local support around the 800s 800 Satoshi level for a while uh and then drop or does it just go straight down I don't really know but um you know these these ideas that we talked about do seem to be to be playing out again the the Satoshi valuation has dropped about 50 since we made these videos okay and arguably if it did get one more 50 drop on its Bitcoin pair then it's basically back down to the lows from the last cycle okay so I think it's an important thing to pay attention to the other thing that I wanted to briefly talk about is we looked at at this Ada Market cycle Peak Roi so from like the peak and then you extend it out towards the bottom this is what it looked like you know one of the videos we showed um I just want to provide an update to that this is what it looks like now right so again the problem is that people want to front run everything um and they they don't want to be patient they don't want to you know just kind of sit around and wait um mostly focus on bitcoin since most all coins bleed to bitcoin during this phase um and having a good cash position they just want to YOLO into the altcoin market as quickly as they can and this was basically me saying back then that look guys it's probably not the bottom because just because it's Q3 of 2022 doesn't mean it doesn't mean anything I mean I thought the same thing in 2018 and then we ended up dropping it at the end of the year the same this drop it occurred right I mean like you can go look at this we eventually dropped right and we could continue to drop I mean look at this it's just continued to slowly drop it bounced back up and then it's now rolling over um once again and so you know at this point last cycle the ROI from the peak was at 0.03 today we're at 0.09 so there are some there is some element here of diminishing losses and as a function of time but the last cycle also took around 802 days to find its true low and we're currently at around day 651 or 6 52. so we could still have another 150 days of this nonsense um before you know before things ultimately shape up uh to to be better okay so an important thing to look at and if you take it out to the next peak of course we we know what happened but I would I would first focus on on this chart um and and just how long it took because again last cycle for Ada you know again I I thought I was a genius for buying it in in Q3 of 2018 and I was not and then I thought I was a genius for you know for for buying some down here when it rallied back up here and then it still just went down and put in a new low and that's why this cycle I've been a lot more hesitant on the altcoin market because I know how long the bleed can last for right like it can last for two years or so um on both their USD Pairs and their Bitcoin pairs so I just wanted to provide an update I mean I haven't forgotten about about ADA um it's just that you have to understand that when we're in the cycle when we're in the phase of the cycle where all coins bleed back to bitcoin it's just harder to justify spending that much time talking about the altcoin market because my general expectation is that they just bleed back to bitcoin and you know we can you can say what you want but cardano is a higher risk play than Bitcoin I'm sure that even if you're in Ada Maxi you could appreciate that thought that cardano is a higher risk play than the Bitcoin and if Bitcoin dominance is in you know looks like it's just breaking out then you typically don't want to fade that because normally the altcoin market bleeds back to it so as far as Ada as far as Ada Bitcoin I would I'd be looking towards you know around 400 Associates which would basically be from the current levels another 60 drop or so I know that might sound like a lot I mean it doesn't mean that ADA just goes down on its USD pair 60 doesn't mean they can't um but it's just no matter what Bitcoin does I would expect Ada to it's a struggle to keep Pace with it probably for most of the rest of the year I mean even over here even though it found its low in Q3 we still really tested those lows until the first quarter of the having year so you might see something um you know you you might see something like this right where it bounces around here for a little bit comes down here and then and then tries to hold this range going into the having year and then maybe you'll find some renewed strength by the Ada Bitcoin valuation the other thing that's not as as um as as gray I mean here you you have more of a an outline the Ada ether evaluation unfortunately at this point looks like it's bleeding I mean these are I mean you know at one point I was more optimistic that might it might be holding these range lows but that doesn't really look to be the case and and that you can see that so far it's just bleeding I I think the thing to look for is if it sort of hugs the lower part of this trend line will it get a bounce back up sort of like a mean reversion type thing back into the general downtrend again does it have to bleed for forever not necessarily but there are a lot of all coins that do and this is something that you should consider again don't take it up with me take it up with it take it up with the data at this point it has been bleeding right I mean these lows are going lower as a function of time again I don't control it I just want you to know what it is so this is something to look out for as well because the Ada ether evaluation hasn't really been looking that great now it could go back up if ethereum capitulates and it capitulates quicker than the altcoin market or if Ada outperforms ethereum at some point in a future bull market but I mean this isn't really the greatest look at this point so this is something that I think is worthwhile to keep an eye on as the as the months passes by right so keep an eye on the 8th evaluation the Ada Bitcoin valuation is a little bit more clear-cut at least in the short term and finally um the Ada USD valuation is currently coming in around 26 Cents we know we just put on a new low again based on on you know some of the stuff that we looked at over here we know that it can last for you know I mean it can still go on for another you know five months or something um so that's just something to think about it's really hard calling you know calling bottoms okay I'm not gonna sit here and pretend to do it I think what's more important is to look at Ada Bitcoin valuation and and to see if it holds its lows um it's maybe future lows let's say if it goes to 400 sochi's if it can hold those levels then it might start to justify it but right now um it's it's in my opinion it's a little bit harder to justify it not to say that it can't go it can't not to say that it can't bounce back up on its USD pair if Bitcoin goes back up we know that it probably would but the problem is that again if if it's bleeding against Bitcoin no matter if bitcoin's going up or down then then the risk you know your risk adjust returns aren't as attractive as just holding Bitcoin during this phase of the market cycle again I don't control what it is it just is what it is I hope you can understand that it's not personal um and I

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptiverse today we're going to talk about the ethereum Bitcoin valuation more specifically we're going to discuss the likelihood of a potential collapse if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptographs premium at into the cryptiverse.com let's go ahead and jump in so it should be of no surprise at this point uh to to most of you that my general expectation is that the ethereum Bitcoin valuation will continue to slowly go down now it has been going down slowly for quite some time but it could start to accelerate as we get further into the summer and we've talked about this a lot I've tried to do as good of a job as I can to prepare people for what I would consider to be the most likely outcome before we get too far into this I do want to say that throughout this video I will present plenty of evidence to suggest that the ethereum Bitcoin valuation will go down a lot um with that said there's no such thing as a sure thing in financial markets okay so you know I can present all the evidence for something and it doesn't mean that it has to play out uh so I do want to at least acknowledge that to the people that would disagree with my point of view do know that you know no even if we disagree there's still right there's still a chance that the evidence does not actually you know that it doesn't actually pan out but I do want to explain why I still think that the the drop of ethereum Bitcoin has been going on and will likely continue to go on now one of the things a knee-jerk reaction to have is something like this is that well we've been talking about the collapse for a while now right and one of the things about the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is it has been relatively resilient we know that again I will humbly point out that despite all of these moves to the upside by by the ethereum Bitcoin valuation it should not detract from the idea that legitimately every single pump has just been nothing more than a lower high even this move here topped out at around 0.07093 and then the most recent one topped out at 0.07088 so even that one's a lower high right even that one's a lower high compared to what came just a month or two ago so there is this element of hey if the merge were so you know were such a great thing for the ethereum Bitcoin valuation then why has it been putting in lower highs since September which by the way again was a lower high when compared to December of 2021 so I still can't get I I can't remove myself from this obvious fact that I think a lot of people choose to ignore and that is the fact that we have seen a series of lower highs since late 2021. the merge did not change anything it has not changed anything now one might say that the narrative or sorry the tokenomics of ethereum have changed things I would argue they haven't changed much of anything in terms of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation now one reaction could be to say well Ben it's mid-2023 and it's still sitting at .07 so what gives right what gives if if if this were 2018 or 2019 it would have already dropped well a Counterpoint to that is that there is so much excess liquidity that has just been taking a long time to shake out now the ethereum Bitcoin valuation has been going mostly sideways since May of 2021. you can very very easily see this by just overlaying a 50-week moving average and seeing in fact that it has gone sideways um you know here since April of 2022 I mean obviously not Sideways from here because it's going to take a while for the 50 week to get up there but it's basically just been going sideways for a long time okay now even though the tokenomics of ethereum of course changed and we know that there's these deflationary aspects to it we should remind ourselves that the the Bitcoin dominance right the Bitcoin dominance it just broke the Range High and again the Bitcoin dominance is also concerned with the altcoin market too it's not just ethereum it's also the stable coin market and so the ethereum dominance hasn't really budged yet it's still sitting at about 20 to 21 so this excess liquidity from this cycle has taken much longer than it did last cycle right so last cycle we were able to break the Range High relatively quickly this time it has taken a much longer period to break it argue arguably because of all the excess liquidity so I think it would be premature to celebrate the resilient or the sustained resilience of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation as if it means that it won't drop at this stage there is still a likelihood a strong likelihood that the Bitcoin dominance rally to 60 percent will be fueled by the collapse of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation one thing to consider is that the last time the dominance was at this level and or maybe slightly below was in the summer of 22 the summer of 22. that was the last time the dominance was at this level but what's interesting about that is when it was at this level it was when the ethereum Bitcoin valuation was all the way down here at around 0.05 so now we have the ethereum Bitcoin valuation at 0.067 and the dominance of Bitcoin is already above where it was last summer so my speculation is that now the Range High is broken just like it broke over here just like it broke in 2019 as well the the the fuel for it to go higher will largely come we're not maybe largely it'll come from the altcoin market too but I think a lot of it will in fact come from the devaluation of The Ether Bitcoin ratio okay so yes if you are a bull on the ethereum Bitcoin valuation you would clearly appoint towards its resilience that is what you would Point towards and that's true it has been resilient but then again there's a lot of altcoins that have been resilient and I don't really consider ethanol but there are a lot of altcoins that have been relatively resilient this cycle compared to the prior cycle but we are still in a a period of QT and higher interest rates and a slowing economy and therefore I I do think that we will see a very similar outcome at the end of the day one of the things that I wanted to mention is that there's several guiding moving averages that we can we can look towards there is of course the bull market support band which consists of the 20-week SMA and the 21-week EMA you can see that really ever since January of 2023 the ethereum Bitcoin valuation has been unable to get back above it in a sustained way it did briefly happen back over here it happened back over here and then it also occurred back here now we talked about this we said guys it can pop above it but if it just comes back down the following week then it was it was a fake out right and if you zoom in here to the bulmark sportpin for the ethereum Bitcoin evaluation you can see that it actually closed below the 20-week SMA and the 21 week EMA for that matter and so far this week has just been a continuation of that Trend right it's just continuing to push lower so as far as I can tell all we've seen with the ethereum Bitcoin violation is a series of lower Highs at least in the short term now I will remind you that over a longer period of time we have seen a series of higher lows but we've also had lower highs from 2017. so there's this element here of perhaps the time to consider a more likely bullish trend is somewhere down here and maybe it's down here that we can then start to speculate about some type of recovery but I still do think that this part is going to be a necessary component whether you want to argue that the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is an oscillator and it has to come back down here or whether you want to argue that it'll eventually come back up this way I think no matter what it likely has to come back down in the short term before we figure out the ultimate trajectory of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation another moving average that you can look towards and this is something we spoke at length about a couple years ago before a few years ago before the bull market began is the 20-month SMA so if you look at the 20-month moving average you will see that once upon a time we held support on the 20 month and we sort of broke through the 20 the reason why it was important was because back in early 2020 we were watching how the ethereum Bitcoin valuation kept coming up to the 20 months but unable to break it it finally broke it in July of 2020 back tested it and then off to the races we got a monthly close below here but just like with the bull market support band it was a fake out and we we came back up right and then now we've started to get multiple monthly closes below the 20-month SMA right so over here you had a breakout and then back test and then go now we have a break down a back test and then potentially go right so that is what I'm still looking at is this idea that it's likely going to turn around look at the 20-month moving average in general I mean you can see that there's there's some elements of ebb and flow to this thing and it looks like it's it's potentially about to to roll back over again so I do think that's another way that we can look at the ethereum Bitcoin evaluation another way to look at it is to go take a look at the daily candles and compare it to bitcoin usd's distribution phase if you go look at Bitcoin many of you will likely remember how there was this period in 2021 where Bitcoin USD had this distribution phase in early 2021 right you have one two three and four ethereum's Bitcoin valuation have the same thing right you had one two three and four and then Bitcoin came back down right it retraced it then went back up and got your little one-two punch for your last and final distribution phase before the actual downtrend began the ethereum Bitcoin valuation also had a very similar thing right your little one-two punch and the secondary distribution phase and ever since then it has been down now with Bitcoin remember you know just because this trend started down it wasn't you know it wasn't clear that was going to break this level until quite a long time later right I mean it you know we had to wait until the summer of 22 to actually see this break back to the downside this from this point right from this peak here to the actual breakdown the first breakdown was about 183 days if you look at the ethereum Bitcoin valuation from this point here it's been already 281 days so it has been taking longer admittedly but I would still look at this and say guys this is still a downtrend right like this is still very much a downtrend right like Bitcoin USD had a downtrend right it wasn't straight down it went down back up and then collapse the ethereum Bitcoin valuation has done all sorts of stuff right I mean it hasn't it hasn't just gone down in a straight in a straight line it is um let me actually draw a path on here so I can you know it's been sort of all over the place but every single time it ends up just slowly pushing lower so I'm thinking that it's likely going to come back down to this range relatively soon maybe bounce and then get the final collapse um down down this way so that's what I'm looking towards for the ethereum Bitcoin evaluation again if you want to um talk about you know the the amount of time it's taking it has taken longer than I thought it would might not happen right it might not happen but it still does seem to be to be the most likely outcome and if you wanted to take the other view and say that it's been bullish then I would argue how can you you know how can you say that considering that again it's just been a series of lower highs so if it's so bullish why is it a series of lower highs continuing on another thing that we can look at our monthly hikanashi candles so if you look at the monthly High kanashi candles of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation you will pretty clearly see right you have you know your initial just your initial move up and then your first distribution phase and then your second distribution phase right so you have your initial move up and then your first distribution phase and then your second distribution phase note that after this really the secondary distribution phase we kind of hung around this level for a while we had some red hikingashi candles we had some green but then once we got to July we saw the collapse right once we got to July now we're still kind of hanging out up in this area but I'm guessing within weeks I don't know exactly when right but within a few weeks I think it will also collapse in the same way okay so you have you know you have several different moves here and if we if we were to sort of draw a path right you have your first move two three four five six seven eight right so doing that again for this cycle you have one two three four five six seven eight so that's sort of the path that I think it will go and it probably isn't going to bounce back up this high like if it if you know if it bounces it might do something like that um so drop drop as we get deeper into the summer maybe bounce back up and then and then the final the final collapse uh could come could come a little bit later so I'm thinking it's going to look something like that now one thing that we should remind ourselves of is of the tokenomics because there there is this idea of why are we looking at just the price valuations considering that the supply can change right so perhaps a better way to look at this would be the ratio of the ethereum market cap divided by the Bitcoin market cap and this goes back to the idea that you'll see many people talk about and that's the idea of the flipping but I will say you know I mean if the ethereum ethereum hasn't really made any progress on that in fact the ethereum Bitcoin market cap valuations were actually uh higher in 2018 than they really ever came during this most recent cycle so if anything I think you could argue that there hasn't been any progress by the ethereum Bitcoin valuation to to Earth by ethereum to flip Bitcoin from one cycle to another now of course there's been there's been progress since you know 2019 but I'm not comparing it to 2019. right we're comparing it to over here one gotcha moment that I see a lot of people say is things like well you know this has been going up since 2019 and you know how can you call it Bears I I would like to remind you again right that I was very bullish on it throughout this entire phase okay it wasn't really until over here then I finally said hey it's it's you know it should likely bleed back down and it slowly has been right it very very slowly has been especially after after after we had the merge rally finalized so I will remind you that just because you're bearish on something you know over here doesn't mean that you've always been bearish on it it just means that you know it's a market markets change and you should be allowed to change your mind the other thing to look at here is that this is potentially an oscillator and you know we don't really have the data on this go on this chart at least going back to 2015 but even sure you can imagine it was it was probably a lot further it was a lot much further down than this but you can imagine that it's sort of like an oscillator at you know as a potential outcome I'm not saying that it has to go all the way back down to these levels but it still would make me think that even if it doesn't go back all the way down here it could come you know it could retrace half of this move um so I'm so I'm still looking for for that to to play out okay the other thing I wanted to mention is if you look at monthly candles for the ethereum Bitcoin valuation we talked about this before we mentioned it many times in May is that normally once you get into June going through the rest of the year the ethereum Bitcoin valuation tends to bleed meaning not every single month but a lot of the months in the pre-halving year of 2019 you'll note that in June July and August we had double digit losses every single month okay we then had sort of like a a brief break in September and then we still continued to go down in October and December not more or less smart a double bottom for the ethereum Bitcoin valuation so I still think that a majority of the rest of the year for the ethereum Bitcoin valuation will in fact be read now the standard deviations on this of course are large so you can see definitely there are some green months in the back half of the year the back seven months but on average the first five months of the year tend to be green for the ethereum Bitcoin valuation in the last seven ten to be read and just visually looking at this right I mean you can look and see over here it's a lot more green over here there's a lot more red so from a seasonality perspective I think we're entering into unfavorable times for the ethereum Bitcoin valuation and I would argue that and as I said last month I think that you know the really The Last Stand will probably be in May and then starting in June we should start to see the you know a larger correction take place so far it's only down about two and a half percent but I do think that that could accelerate um as we as we continue to push forward through the month and as we continue to push forward through the year the other thing that I wanted to mention is that normally you know when Bitcoin closes below its 20-week moving average from weekly close below the 20-week moving average to weekly close above the ethereum Bitcoin valuation tends to underperform so if we can pull up a chart here um so this is the chart I need to make my videos smaller so that you can see it all so we're going to put me up there and normally what this chart shows is like from when it when Bitcoin breaks down to when it breaks up what happens and so you can see that in 2016 when Bitcoin broke when Bitcoin broke down to when it broke up Bitcoin above the 20 week Bitcoin had gone up four percent ethereum had dropped 10 percent right so this is a period here where Bitcoin went below the 20 week and Bitcoin outperformed you can see that in February of 2018 breakdown until breakup in March Bitcoin went up 40 percent um ethereum only went up five and a half okay uh March of there's several here because there was a lot like you know just back to back to back but um there is March of 2018 till July of 2018. Bitcoin went down 14 ethereum went down 35 breakdown in August of 2018 to March 2019 Bitcoin went down 43.5 ethereum went down 67 percent breakdown September 2019 until breakup of January 2020 Bitcoin went up four percent ethereum went down four percent breakdown March of 2020 until breakup in May Bitcoin went up 11 ethereum only went up five percent so what you're seeing is that every time Bitcoin breaks below it Until It Breaks back above it Bitcoin tends to outperform ethereum right here plus one to minus seven and a half here it was so so break down here was negative 5.3 for Bitcoin negative 21.8 for Eve here it was negative 50.4 for Bitcoin negative 51 for each I mean it was mostly equal but still technically ethereum lost more November 2022 until January 2023 what do we see plus 28 for Bitcoin plus 27 for ethereum technically well it's more or less equal technically Bitcoin had the lead so what this shows is that 10 out of 10 or sorry nine out of nine times nine out of nine times that Bitcoin broke below its 20-week moving average until it broke back above Bitcoin outperformed ethereum now sometimes Bitcoin went down and and ethereum just went down a lot more sometimes you know you might have saw Bitcoin actually go back up by the time it broke back through the 20 week SMA during that period if it had a large candle or something but legitimately nine and we've had this table up for years you might say well now that everyone knows I don't know guys we've been talking about this table for what the last three years and so far nine out of nine times it has\n",

      "outperformed ethereum now sometimes Bitcoin went down and and ethereum just went down a lot more sometimes you know you might have saw Bitcoin actually go back up by the time it broke back through the 20 week SMA during that period if it had a large candle or something but legitimately nine and we've had this table up for years you might say well now that everyone knows I don't know guys we've been talking about this table for what the last three years and so far nine out of nine times it has worked every time Bitcoin Falls below its 20-week moving average on a weekly close Bitcoin has outperformed ethereum until we had a weekly close above now the reverse tends to also be true except for one potential scenario and we talked about this you can see that from break above the 20 week SMA by Bitcoin until break below ethereum tends to outperform bitcoin right here October 2016 until February 5th 2018. Bitcoin went up 1161 ethereum went up a very modest 6715 percent if you look at breakup from March 2018 until March 12th 2018 what happened March 5th marches to March 12th Bitcoin went down 17 ethereum only went down 16 percent if you keep going with this idea you will see time and time again how Bitcoin tends to underperform ethereum when Bitcoin is above its 20-week moving average except and we talked about this before as well except for one time that was in the prehabbing year of 2019. Bitcoin broke up Bitcoin went up 106 ethereum only went up 29 this is why we said in 2019 or sorry we said in 2023 that even though bitcoin's about the 20 week a lot of people might assume that ethereum will outperform Bitcoin history shows us that it's not a likely outcome right it says look in the prehabbing year Bitcoin tends to lead because the dominance needs to go higher now what happened we just had the breakup in January and now we had the breakdown in June Bitcoin went up 24 ethereum only went up 12 so it was a fail in terms of above it only working eight out it's not only worked eight out of ten times but I would argue that it's not really a fail because this statement here should really be above it it works if it's not a prehabbing year so if you know if you're to program it right like if year is is not the pre-halving year then it the expectation is that ethereum outperforms Bitcoin when bitcoin's about the 20 week SMA until weekly close below but if it's the pre-halving year then Bitcoin tends to outperform ethereum right if it's the prehabbing year and this is the the prehabbing year so you can see that it did not work but that's not a failure of this indicator because we said it wasn't going to work going into it more than likely we said it's the prehabbing year Bitcoin will likely outperform ethereum okay this is what we said many many times so I I think that you know you can make the case that this this actually worked out relatively well and um and and so far I would argue that that the indicator has been very very helpful another way to look at this too is that if you go say look at things like um you know our Roi after cycle Peak for not after cycle Peak um year-to-date Roi is what I want to look at whereas that one is right here if you want to look at year-to-date Roi for Bitcoin and you look at say 2019 you can see that Bitcoin ended the year positive up about 2x off the off the yearly open ethereum even though Bitcoin went up that year ethereum actually closed below the yearly open right just below the yearly open so there is this element of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation tends to fade in the second half of the prehabbing year so my expectation going into you know as we as we continue to March forward through this year is that this will fade now I mean you can see a very similar area here right I mean we we had we had some red and then we had a little bit of green and then it finally rolled over right so we have we have this sort of phase here I think that right now we're potentially right here and and we're on the on the cusp of of a major breakdown by the ethereum Bitcoin valuation of course it could still take you know several weeks for it to play out uh but I would still argue that fundamentally nothing has changed and if you're if you've been a bull on the ethereum Bitcoin valuation you still have to come to terms with the AI with the fact that it's just been lower highs you know one of the brutal Parts about about bear markets for assets is that a lot of times you'll spend more time going up than going down it's just that when you do go down it goes down very quickly right so like you'll you'll come in here and you'll you'll move higher for so long but it doesn't mean that it can't just completely take out that move extremely quickly okay so please please be aware of that right I mean just like over here we we more or less Trend it higher it didn't change the fact that despite the fact that we have all these Trends higher we eventually took out and put in a new a new local low compared to back in October of 2022. so if I had to draw a path for the ethereum Bitcoin valuation I would draw something like this right I'd say all right maybe it's going to hang out in here a little bit um but it likely will fall back down to this level here maybe bounce back up and then fall uh to the 0.03 to 0.04 range and then from that level we will I would I would assess you know I would I would then start to assess like okay what's going on you know what's the likelihood that this could be the low or or is it is is it more bearish than that but I still do remain bearish on the ethereum Bitcoin valuation I do think it needs to fall back down remember once Bitcoin broke the Range High in in you know back over here we moved up really quickly and part of the reason that the dominance moved up a lot back then was because the ethereum Bitcoin valuation started to collapse because the ethereum Bitcoin valuation back then essentially collapsed from around um if I so here I guess it was all it was all the way down here so it was around 0.058 and then it ended up collapsing all the way down to about 0.017 now I'm not saying it's going to go back down to 0.017 but I still do think that this breakout here was a very bearish Shine for the ethereum Bitcoin valuation and It ultimately dropped a lot more as the months continued on so I do think that that is the likely outcome as well just looking at the the Bitcoin dominance anyways I think we'll wrap it up there if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the crypto virus premium right now the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is coming in at 0.06723 so perhaps we will have to reassess this um I mean we'll do some assessments before the end of the year but once we get to the end of the year uh six months from now we'll come back and say all right well did the ethereum Bitcoin violation drop did it drop like this maybe or or did I do something else and I I don't know yet but I've tried to outline I you know I've tried to lay out the evidence for why I think it's going down and um if you agree with it great if you disagree with it great obviously you have to make your own decisions this of course is not Financial advice anyways we'll wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in I will see you next time bye\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about the altcoin Reckoning if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the crypto various premium uh into the cryptiverse.com before we jump in there are in fact two orders of business to take care of one of which is I am starting a new show on Mondays uh so of course we have not Financial advice live on Thursdays with guy from coin Bureau and Rob from digital asset news but I'm going to start another show on Mondays at 11 A.M Eastern with Gareth soloway okay so do look for that that is going to start this Monday we're going to um uh just more or less have a dialogue uh every single Monday on on the market to talk about what we see going on and and we might experiment with a few different you know formats as the weeks go on but I do look forward to that show and I would encourage everyone to try and tune in I think it should be an interesting conversation so that's the first order of business okay and again that starts on on Monday at 11AM the second order of business is in fact a very serious matter okay and it of course is related to to how people write their fives okay you know I didn't really think this was going to be that big of a deal but you know I put out a poll and after 14 000 votes only seven percent of people write their fives in the most efficient way right only only seven percent of people so only seven percent of people chose the correct answer um as I've said before if you're riding a five and let's say you're writing a number before a five right if you write a one what's the most if you wanted to write 15 you write your one and then you have to come all the way back up here to start your five no you write your one and then you just start your five right here right now if you were to write a two or three or a four right if you write a four where does your where does it end at it ends down here so you just go ahead and write your five okay so I don't really know what's going on with 93 of people saying that they start writing it from the top but that's very inefficient what's more concerning to me is not that 93 of people start from the top what's more concerning to me is that there are people in the comments section saying they start from The Middle what does that mean you know how do you start when what does that mean like you start here and you go up and go over and then do this I mean did you just wake up and decide to be to write the five in the most inefficient way you could possibly imagine I don't know and again I mean there's there's legitimately people saying that they write their five starting from the middle which seems to be like the most inefficient way to do it uh these must be the people that have been buying all coins for the last 18 months but anyways I I wanted to just sort of address that and um and say that you know congratulations to the seven percent of people who in fact chose the correct answer now the altcoin market and the altcoin Reckoning is something we've been talking about for quite some time it was actually in late 20 uh late 2021 that Bitcoin USD fell below its bull market support ban and if you remember it's upon weekly closes below the bull market support ban that the altcoin market tends to get wrecked okay so this started here in late November early December of 2021 and we put out video after video after video talking about how when Bitcoin goes below the 20 week SMA most all coins are just going to bleed back to bitcoin especially when you get into a primary bear Market year in early 2022 we talked about how all coins were too risky and then no matter really the direction of Bitcoin over the Long Haul the altcoin market would likely go down we've put out videos about tips for navigating the bear market and how the altcoin market was just a very high risk play and after coming out of a period of two years or so where all coins were going up we were likely going to be entering a period over the next 18 to 24 months that's what we said back then where the altcoin Market would likely systematically bleed back to bitcoin and of course the US dollar now remember the altcoin Reckoning does not refer to altcoin USD valuations although that is of course an artifact of a bear Market is that all USD valuations will go down but you must remember that the altcoin Reckoning refers to all coins on their Bitcoin pairs that's what it refers to okay and I will continue to scream this as as long as it takes but if you hold a not coin if you buy an altcoin it goes up 20 but Bitcoin went up 50 that's a loss right because when you navigate crypto the correct way to navigate it right just like drawing fives you start from the bottom the correct way to navigate it is to value your portfolio in your in in terms of its Bitcoin valuation the USD valuations are relevant right I mean it just simply is if you if you want to use Bitcoin as sort of your reference point um and and we know that Bitcoin leads the bull markets we know that when it rolls over in the bear it leads everything down portfolio evaluations for crypto in my opinion should be denominated in satoshi's if you disagree with that because you prefer ethereum then you could value your portfolio in terms of its ether valuation you could I mean I'm not saying that I do that although I I do that in a bull market right so in a bull market I will value it in terms of its Bitcoin valuation and its ether evaluation but during the bear Market year and during the pre-halving year um it's basically I just value it in terms of my Bitcoin valuation okay that's all that matters right so you know if you come to me and tell me that you're all coins up 20 this year I don't care you know I really don't I the the Bitcoins up a lot more and guess what if Bitcoin rolls back over and and the summer lull that we've talked about I mean it seems like it's happening right now right but if it continues where do you think the all coin Market's going you can see what's happening right now bitcoin's chilling here at 26k the all coin Market just keeps going down and I've said for for how how long now liquidity is leaving and if the altcoin market were so bullish then why does it just keep going down you know all these all these people that keep showing you these meme coins these all coins and whatnot yo what's going on right if if everything's so bullish why is total three trending below it's 20 weeks to me just like it did in 2019. you have to ask yourself this right you have to ask yourself is this the case now there's some people out there I see saying that well it's only happening because the recent actions by the SEC guys we've talked about this for a year and a half right it's not just the SEC you know it's not I mean of course that's going to be the narrative but it's not just the SEC all coins have been going down against Bitcoin some of them have been going down since like the middle of 2021 so literally two years ago some of these down Trends began so you can't tell me that it's just because of what the SEC is doing today that's causing this because that is is is not really an accurate and accurate um Outlook in my opinion right now if you look at total three what you will in fact notice is that it is only above its 20 above its March Low by about two and a half percent another two and a half percent drop and it's taken out the March Low by the way some all coins have already taken out not only their March low some of them have taken out this low too the all coin Reckoning continues now I will remind you that it doesn't mean that you can't ever see them bounce back up on their USD pairs in fact if Bitcoin bounces good chance you could see all coins bounce but look at this on Lower time frames okay we've talked about this if Bitcoin goes up or if Bitcoin goes down guess what all coins Get Wrecked on their Bitcoin pairs look at the daily time frame for total three and tell me what you see I'll tell you what I see but look at the daily time frame total three red candle green but this green one barely move it barely retraced anything red candle green barely retraced anything now go look at bitcoin's Daily candles until and and you tell me what you see look at this red green Bitcoin retraced the whole move back up red green it's still halfway on this candle right here so what's happening Bitcoin is washing the altcoin market out liquidity from here is going into Bitcoin and ethereum and US Dollars that's what's happening okay liquidity is just washing around from from lower liquid assets to higher liquid assets from high risk assets to low risk assets now you might say well Bitcoin is still high risk completely agree it's a risk asset as much as you might want it to be a risk-off asset it's not in my opinion it might be one day but it's not today and you'd be correct in saying the Bitcoin is a high risk asset I would agree with that but it's not about what it is relative to other asset classes like the S P 500 or like or like just equities in general um it's not what it's in reference to say gold or silver or or real estate it's in reference to cryptocurrencies out of every single cryptocurrency Bitcoin is the safest one it faces the least amount of regulatory scrutiny now you might say well that makes me a maxi and I've told you guys for the last 18 months I'm not a Bitcoin Maxi I just have my Bitcoin Maxi hat on because I've lived through these Cycles on more than one occasion believe it or not and I've seen what happens to the altcoin market during this phase they get decimated all coins get decimated on their Bitcoin Pairs and it can last for 18 to 24 months and it can even last longer for some some all coins never stop bleeding against Bitcoin and that's a fact my friends that's just simply a fact so when you look at total three if the altcoin market is so strong then why does it keep going down this liquidity here is going into Bitcoin and ethereum admittedly the reason I don't talk about ethereum as much um in terms of all coins bleeding to eth is because I think eth is also bleeding to bitcoin which of course is a somewhat controversial view right I think both sides have have uh valid opinions I I I just agree I I think it's it's more so than ethereum's bleeding back to bitcoin but that's not to say that people who took the reverse approach have been any worse off I mean mostly the ethereum Bitcoin valuation has just gone sideways for the last two years so it's more or less a wash at this point on the ether Bitcoin valuation but my contention is is one thing that people keep asking me when will the altcoin Reckoning end when will it end my response to that is that it will end when the ethereum Bitcoin evaluation collapses that's my opinion could I be wrong I could be wrong okay I've been wrong about plenty of things when it comes to financial markets but my guess is the collapse of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation will Mark the end of the altcoin Reckoning the collapse has not occurred yet therefore liquidity there's still sufficient liquidity that's going from the altcoin market to bitcoin and ethereum there is still sufficient liquidity at this point because we haven't seen the ethereum Bitcoin valuation collapse at some point liquidity from the altcoin market will be completely dried up but then at that point it will no longer be able to support the USD evaluations of Bitcoin and ethereum and then that's where you see those go down and I think ethereum liquidity will dry up before Bitcoin liquidity does which would send the ethereum Bitcoin valuation down so we have total three currently coming in at around 332 billion now I know what a lot of you are thinking you know is this a significant area considering that it was around this area that we got a bounce back over here you can see that it went all the way down to about 322 billion so about 10 billion below where we currently are and we also balanced at this level back in March of 2023 so you're probably thinking well hey could we bounce again could you know we certainly could you could see a bounce maybe not I mean maybe a little bit lower right I mean if you look out at where it is um where we bounce last this uh back in March 23 and then June of 22 it was all the way down to around 322 billion so could we see a bounce on their USD pairs on the altcoin USD pairs if and when that occurs of course we could you know one of the biggest things that I've I've dealt with over the last you know year and a half or so is that we see the altcoin market yeah we talk about how the altcoin Reckoning is is happening and it's continue it will continue to happen more than likely and it does and then at some point in the nebulous future all coins rally on their USD pairs not because they're bullish fundamentally but because Bitcoin rallied and it's just taken everything with it um it's you know it's generous like that so yes right you could see temporary rallies for all coins on their USD pairs it doesn't mean a thing if the Bitcoin valuations are going down take a look at total three divided by Bitcoin market cap we've talked about this before right it's just a macro distribution phase you know the altcoin market is systematically bleeding to bitcoin you have I mean if you want to call it Wyckoff distribution right first Peak was in May of 2021 second Peak was in September of 2021 just before Bitcoin rallied third Peak was in January of 22. fourth Peak was in November of 22. looks like a macro distribution phase to me a lot of a lot of what we see in crypto is very cyclical okay you know whenever we're up here no one ever thinks we're going to go down here wherever we're down here no one ever thinks we're gonna go back up we're still in this phase where I think we're in a downtrend any given week who knows what's going to happen Okay usually you know usually you will see a rally by the altcoin market just as a sort of a relief rally right at some point but it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it's done they're done bleeding on their Bitcoin pairs remember the altcoin Reckoning does not refer to their USD evaluations it refers to their Bitcoin valuations the USD devaluations of all coins are are more or less just a given over the macro scale because most of them simply go to zero some of them survive most of them don't the meme coins that were being launched a couple of months ago by everyone and their moms most of them are now going back down to zero most of them are down 80 to 85 percent already right they're already down and people aren't talking about it as much so you have to be careful with with the meme coins right you have to be careful with them most of them just sort of come in uh they launch people generate height influencers get paid to generate hype and and then the early people that got in on some you know BS pre-sell they dump on everyone and then they just launch a new one and if you're not with them they consider you against them and they drag your name through the mud but I'm telling you those meme coins are designed to do one thing and one thing only and that's to suck in as much liquidity as they can that's what they're designed to do nothing more okay you know people should stop saying that Meme coins lead to Growing adoption that is complete and utter garbage no it does not they do not lead to more adoption if Moon coins needed more adoption than wise total three in a macro downtrend right if meme coins lead to more adoption then why are views across all YouTube channels that promote meme coins going down okay they do not promote adoption they promote people Mo the majority of people to to get wrecked that's what happens right and and some people swear by them because they try to get in early just so they can dump on someone else and then move on to the next thing right don't fall off of these scams they're everywhere don't fall for them honestly the best thing you could do is just go enjoy go enjoy your summer and and stop worrying about all these meme coins because most of them are going to go to zero anyways okay the ones that'll stay on the test of time the cryptocurrencies that we'll see on the test of time are the ones that are actually doing something useful Bitcoin is the clear case I think ethereum makes a clear case too beyond that I don't know I don't know don't marry an altcoin that's all I can say everyone loves their communities for the all coins but uh don't marry the altcoins because you see what happens right you see what happens if you look at total three in fact one of the interesting things is that every rally by total three so far has been in fact a 40 rally so from here to here about a 40 rally this one here was also about a 40 rally and then this one here was also about a 40 rally nothing's changed so far okay and I think I think there's still a decent chance that these things continue to fade you know I put out videos on this stuff every every few months and and people have all sorts of reactions to them then you revisit it a few months later and it's just the all coin Market continues to go down okay so try to zoom out you know during this phase over here in this phase um you know it it's easy for for people to sort of rationalize why the altcoin market is strong on on you know a three to four week uptrend but then you just sort of zoom out and you come back a little bit later and and this is what happened one of the things I told one of the things I said many times is that the upside Target for the altcoin market this year is the low 400 billion dollar range how many times did we say that right and I went to what 407 billion look at this the altcoin market is so strong why couldn't it take out it's it's November High right couldn't even take that out Bitcoin took it out easily I mean the look at this this is where Bitcoin this is the the November high for Bitcoin it took it out back in January if meme coins lead to Growing adoption then why couldn't the altcoin market take out the 2022 High the late 2022 High you couldn't do it the quoted he's trying out that's the reason liquidity is drying up and that's why we continue to talk about the altcoin Reckoning now if we go through a couple of things here one of which is of course well how do you know when to buy all coins well first of all if you're asking me it's probably too soon second of all um one of the things that gets me in the most trouble is that I I say this stuff constantly and then we get a rally you know a 10 20 reality and then the pitchforks come out but then you just fast forward a few more months and you see what ultimately happened remember this remember this as long as the dominance of Bitcoin right you knew I was going to work this in right as long as the dominance is below 49 then we are just in a holding pattern okay this is trending higher this is turning higher you know some people are saying things like well the RSI is overheated you know just as a Counterpoint to that I don't really think using the RSI for this stuff is is worthwhile legitimately at all but if you did want to use the RSI consider this fact that in 2019 the weekly RSI spent months at levels higher than where we are today months at levels higher than where we are today from July mostly until September we and we were mostly at those levels that are again higher than where the weekly RSI has been at any point in 2023 so I would still say um you know there has been some consolidation here look at the um if you look at the daily RSI of the Bitcoin dominance by consolidating for the last two and a half months it's it's allowed to cool off a lot so I do think it's ultimately going to be gearing up for another big move to the upside and remember it's upon the break of the Range High that then the altcoin Reckoning gets into its pin ultimate stage the\n",

The speaker argues that as long as Bitcoin's dominance remains below 49%, the altcoin market is in a holding pattern, with liquidity flowing from altcoins to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The speaker claims that the upside target for the altcoin market this year is the low 400 billion dollar range, and that meme coins do not lead to real adoption, but rather exist to suck in liquidity. The speaker advises against \"marrying\" altcoins, as most are likely to go to zero, and suggests focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum as the cryptocurrencies that will stand the test of time.

      "higher than where the weekly RSI has been at any point in 2023 so I would still say um you know there has been some consolidation here look at the um if you look at the daily RSI of the Bitcoin dominance by consolidating for the last two and a half months it's it's allowed to cool off a lot so I do think it's ultimately going to be gearing up for another big move to the upside and remember it's upon the break of the Range High that then the altcoin Reckoning gets into its pin ultimate stage the second to last stage occurs once the Bitcoin dominance breaks the Range High hasn't happened yet right when's it gonna happen I don't know I would have thought it would have already happened by now but it hasn't happened yet but the great thing is that it hasn't because it hasn't happened yet it's made you know navigating crypto in my opinion very simple right and and that is if you really want to invest in crypto there's Bitcoin and then there's everything else that's bleeding to bitcoin during this stage that's not an all that doesn't go on forever but we're just in that stage where it is going on so it makes it it makes investing in the asset class relatively simple but once you break this level this 49 level once it goes then you have to start thinking about okay well how high is it going to go before it finally cools off and then you start to get into the final the final stages of of the altcoin Reckoning to go through a few examples right and by the way one thing I want to remind people of is again this does include stable coins if you exclude stable coins as I've said Bitcoin dominance excluding Stables just keeps putting in higher lows since May of 2021 it's just one Higher low after another and you know I mean people have been trolling me about the Bitcoin dominance for the last two years but all I see are higher lows okay so it kind of seems silly to you know to sit around and think that the dominance hasn't been trading higher when it's been putting in higher lows for legitimately two years now and where is that represented well go take a look at the altcoin market you know if you look at a lot of these all coins they're bleeding systematically on their Bitcoin Pairs and we've talked about this for a long time Ada Bitcoin look at this it's already putting in new lows from March putting in new lows right now it's at 1159 satoshi's I've said many times that you know going into this summer we're likely going to see it probably go down to 800 satoshi's but I could see it going to 400 satoshi's before it's all said and done now maybe it goes down here and then maybe this move down here could be on a Bitcoin rally but I'm telling you I mean you know back in 2019 I didn't think it was going to go to 400 satoshi's and it did now look what's going on now bitcoin's holding steady at 26 and a half 80 USD just keeps on dropping about to take out its March low which keeps on dropping us at 30 cents bitcoin's going going sideways 80 USD is going down ergo Ada Bitcoins going down 800 Associates probably is my is my thinking this summer dot Bitcoin coming into these lows from December 2020. you know this is one of those that has been legitimately essentially down only for the most part um but it's down 81 percent against Bitcoin so you have you know you have its USD pair which is down itself 91 so think about this for a second dot USD is down 91 from the high Bitcoin USD from at this current time is down 61 so dot went down against Bitcoin by 80 something percent even though that's something being measured also went down 61 remember just because an altcoin goes down 80 doesn't mean it can't do it again and you see that we talked about this so many times and you can see it happening look at dot it's down 91 but look at this first 80 move to the downside right it had an 80 correction and from that point it had another 62 correction so far right now it's down to about 54 percent go look at Ada USD right from the highs you take it down eighty percent that gets you to 63 cents another 80 down from there would get you to 12 cents 12 and a half cents I'm telling you guys it's possible look last cycle 80 USD it went down 80 percent and then after it went down 80 percent it went down another eighty percent and after it went down another 80 it went down another 67 percent so you know there there's a lot of people that just think that like it has to be over because it's already down 80 percent but as I've said just because it goes down 80 percent doesn't mean it can't go down 80 again doesn't mean it's done so you have to be careful with the altcoin market you have to be now a lot of times someone will say well you know it's it's it's difficult selling all coins when they're down this much guys I'm not recommending you do anything specific I'm not I've been giving These Warnings out for a year and a half so that you wouldn't be in the situation so that you wouldn't be sitting here having to make that decision that's why we talk about the altcoin racketing all the time it doesn't make me any friends in fact most most people just troll me for it right but I'm telling you I've lived through this multiple times and the people that continue to promote you know all these things is as you know as as going up and whatnot to new highs where are they going to be if they all put in new lows okay 80 USD approaching 30 cents dot is at five dollars link is at less than six dollars you know this is one of those that the more it tasks this down you know this area down here I mean eventually it could it could break right you could all you could have also said the same thing for the upside because the upside was more or less at nine dollars but this rap this last rally didn't even get to that level right I mean or maybe it was slightly higher about almost ten dollars this last one sort of stopped right just below nine dollars and it's it's coming back down so avax look at it it's getting it already took out its March low right so you have Avalanche which already took out its March low and it's only another 22 drop 23 drop away from putting in a new low on its USD pair now again the Bitcoin valuations are more relevant Ada Bitcoin down 17 this week dot Bitcoin down three and a half percent this week down 81 since the highs link Bitcoin down five percent this week coming into the prior low you might be tempted to say well does that mean this is going to hold could it hold maybe but guess what if you thought that if you thought drawing a line across from its May low it's summer 2022 low as as a reason for it to bounce Ave Bitcoin didn't get that memo you draw a line over to its Melo you can see it it already went below it already went below it back tested it and continues down so Ave Bitcoin didn't get that memo what's a lot of Bitcoin doing the same thing it's been doing for the last two years basically going down against Bitcoin and every single time it gets a pump back up everyone gets excited and then it just Fades so a lot of Bitcoins down almost 14 this week look what's been guiding the salon of Bitcoin valuation down for the last um you know year and a half the bear Market resistance band it's guiding it to the depths okay BNB Bitcoin down 12 this week Litecoin Bitcoin coming up to the bear Market resistance band The Litecoin having is coming up in August but remember Litecoin USD normally peeks out before it's having yellow lines are the halvings for Litecoin does Litecoin rally after the having or does it rally going into it and then Peak out early it normally peeks out early normally it finds its high whatever it's going to go to in June or maybe the first week of July it's June now and the market risk remains High the idiosyncratic risk of Litecoin is that of course the upside potential is based on the having but the market risk of the entire asset class is still quite High especially with all this regulation and so I don't really know what litecoin's going to do but whatever it's going to do I would expect it to do it within the next few weeks and then likely fade for the next several months after that just like it did in the second half of 2015 just like it did in the second half of 2019 just like it'll probably do in the second half of 2023. you know this time doesn't always have to be different it could just be the same thing maker Bitcoin continues to go lower Theta Bitcoin continues to go lower I mean look at this it's down it's down almost 90 percent avax Bitcoin we talked about this one as well right just in a in sort of a descending triangle rejection below back test the bear Market resistance band rejected new lows continues to go lower Matic Bitcoin down 13 14 this week we talked about this by the way in one of the all coin Reckoning videos back from you know early 2023 saying that this is likely just some macro distribution phase looks like it to me now I want to talk about something else because many of you disagree with me about something and not something is the ethereum Bitcoin valuation and who am I to discredit your opinion considering that for the last two years the ethereum Bitcoin valuation has gone sideways but here's the thing we have all first of all I do still think ethereum Bitcoin valuation will go down second of all the thing we have to consider is something I've always said ethereum's a blue chip ethereum is a Lucha okay Bitcoin is safer I think Bitcoin is a primary Blue Chip but if you had to pick a second one it's ethereum the data backs it up because guess what all these all coins they're bleeding to bitcoin for the most part but guess what else they're also bleeding to eat look at Ada ether you know we've talked about this potentially being I've never I've never been super sure is it in a you know is it an oscillator or is it a bleeder right is it a bleeder and and right now you could start to make the case and it's a leader I mean it's down 17 this week if it's if it's in this say a channel like this if it's in a channel like this then what does that mean it means you can see a to Ether fall another 30 percent or more which is significant I mean that's a significant drop Ave ether what is there to say you know down 90 percent again you're not going to make friends telling them that these all coins are are going to the depths on their Bitcoin Pairs and their ether pairs but this is not you know this is not the first time it's happened look at this ah avax eth if if it wants to be an oscillator big F it could still drop another 40 just before we get to the point where we figure out if it's an oscillator or not Ada might not be an oscillator on its ether pair it might not be I don't know yet I don't know if this is just a wick down and that ether is going to capitulate tomorrow or if this legitimately is a bleeder I don't know but I'm prepared to think that it might be a bleeder I don't know yet we'll have to wait and see be open-minded dot eth let's say a few words okay I mean this thing has just been going down March 2021 it's now down 89 remember this is not DOT USD this is dot ether ether is is is well down from its all-time high so you have polka dot which is down almost 90 percent against something that also went down a lot that my friends is the altcoin Reckoning okay that's how badly they can get wrecked look at BNB ether we talked about this one too we talked about how it was likely to double top uh ever since then you can see that the BNB eth evaluation is is capitulating right it's down 12 percent so what do I think is happening we talked about this a long time right liquidity from the altcoin market it's being sucked up into the Blue Chips Bitcoin and ethereum I think that eventually this liquidity from the Auckland Market will dry up now what does that mean well if you think about it you know if if people go out today because they have their cryptocurrency on some nebulous exchange and they're like all right well I gotta I gotta sell it and they go to USD and then maybe they put it in their bank account or they put it into Bitcoin or ether for a time there is sufficient liquidity that can come out of the altcoin market right because the all coin Market has just been overvalued for so long so by selling all coins and going by Bitcoin going to buy ether or just going straight from that altcoin to those blue chips that can provide support for those blue chips to stay elevated on their USD pairs for some time the issue is at some point the altcoins become such a shell of their former self that even selling them isn't going to provide much purchasing power in terms of Bitcoin or ether right like maybe maybe someone goes and sells the raw coins but they're already down 95 percent so by getting them and then purchasing the Blue Chips you're not really going to be getting a whole lot because the the altcoins on their USD pairs went down during a period where the the blue chips on their USC pairs are up or sideways So eventually liquidity is drained and then the Blue Chips they go down to and then they crush the altcoin market which is already down so that's how it normally plays out and you also have link ether which is I mean I I mean I don't even know what this I mean this is just I mean it's just a systematic bleed I mean this is how many red candles is this in a row for link ether this I mean this is legitimately 10 weeks in a row of red on the link ether evaluation so where does it all end where does the altcoin Reckoning end in some sense for some for many altcoins the answer is never okay look at some relics from a prior cycle look at say like Dash Bitcoin could you look at this and say that it ever ended you might say well no Ben this is uh this is you're just measuring it from the Peak at all in guys this is not the 2021 Peak the 2021 the 2021 is here this was the 2017 Peak the early 2017 Peak the reality is that many art coins the bleed will never stop on their Bitcoin valuations it will just simply never stop look at this chart legitimately just look at it Dash Bitcoin A Relic from a prior cycle it's down almost 99 percent okay as a measured from 2017 until the beginning phase of 2020 it was down to 95 percent you might have thought hey 95 that's a bargain since then it's still down another 70 percent the altcoin Reckoning for some lot coins will never end okay I just won't the way that you navigate crypto during the bear Market year and the prehabbing year for the most part is you just don't worry about the altcoin market you let it do its thing you go out you touch some grass you wait for the dominance to break Higher One Day it probably will and then you just you know you you go out and you see what all coins have survived and then you can and then you can sort of talk about them but you can see just how badly some of these Get Wrecked look at Monero Bitcoin A Relic as well right this is a relic you might say well hey it's not doing so bad from his 2021 Peak but guess what this is a 2021 Peak this was the 2018 Peak back over here now the bleeding has sort of stopped on this one for a little while right it's been arguably going sideways um for for a couple of years but the point is that it hasn't really ever gone back into a sustained uptrend there's so many more cryptocurrencies like this there's so many more that they just bleed on their Bitcoin pairs forever some of them won't some of them will likely recover at some point and there will probably be a Class A new class of cryptocurrencies that will come out at some point and and people will talk about those but the all coin Reckoning is a serious thing you should not laugh at it just because you know because you think that oh well if your altcoin's already down 80 it can't keep dropping the altcoin Reckoning can go on and on and on and on and it's only until after the dominance Range High is broken that all coins even even get to the penultimate stage of the altcoin Reckoning which hasn't even happened yet so these are extremely important considerations to make remember total three market cap divided by Bitcoin market cap it looks like an oscillator at best to me and needs to come back down okay so where does it end well for some it never will for others it will and where I think it ends I've been clear about I think it ends upon the collapse of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation that is what I think you have all right to disagree with me and I respect your opinion if you do okay I just I have my opinion as well and I think that this is going to collapse and um probably come back down here maybe bounce back up and then and then Plunge when is it going to happen I don't know I would have told you five months ago okay but there's there's there's there's been a lot more resilience in in ethereum than I thought there was going to be it doesn't mean that it won't eventually break back down okay even last cycle you know from from these levels right from you know when it when it finally broke down you can see there's three distinct times right exhibit a b and then we broke it on the third or maybe the third was not broken it was the fourth that broke here if you want to if you want to look at it in the same way we have sort of your first one when did the second one occur did it occur right after it no it occurred over a year later 50 about 54 weeks later or so something like that we're currently at week 50 or no 51. so I I still do think that we could easily see the devaluation of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation and it will likely be the collapse of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation that should Mark the end of the altcoin Reckoning but it hasn't happened yet and arguably until it happens um the Bitcoin dominance you know continues to sort of consolidate just below the Range High at some point I think ethereum Bitcoin goes down Bitcoin dominance breaks out the altcoin market bleeds to USD it bleeds to bitcoin and the dominance goes you know to 60 or something and then we can and then we can talk more about about altcoins this is the altcoin Reckoning we've talked about it for a long time I've I've tried to be as open and honest as I can be with people again you know outsized gains are created in the altcoin market during a bull market extravagant losses come in the bear market and the pre-having air with all coins okay now there's other ways to measure this too if you look at if you look at um if we measure from Peak to bottom for Ada last cycle look at this it still wasn't over so it's not even you know so it's not that this time is different it's not it's that this time is the same to a large extent look at the Ada USD bear market last cycle we're currently at day number from Peak we're currently at day 645 or so last cycle it didn't end until day 802. you know you're talking about another half year of this almost maybe not quite but it may around that and you might say well bad it's not fair we had a recession last time we had the the pandemic drop guys we also have the same risk this cycle it's not the exact I mean it might not be the pandemic risk but we have an inverted yield curve just like we have in 2019 and we could get a recession and late this year early next year and it could resolve in the same way where the final capitulation of all coins on their USD pairs occur during a recession by that point they could have already bottomed out on their Bitcoin pairs right there's a chance but last cycle this went on for a long time Ada was putting in new lows even in the having year so you just we need to remember this aspect of it okay um and so I I will continue to say that that is is what I consider to be the most likely outcome that the altcoin Reckoning will continue and the definition remember is all coins bleed on their Bitcoin pairs USD pairs are relevant to me okay I still think they're likely going to go down and many will put in new lows but they're relevant you might and you are irrelevant and you might say well Ben what all coins are putting in\n",

      "\n",
      "The transcript presents a strongly bearish outlook on the altcoin market, emphasizing the \"altcoin Reckoning\" - a systematic bleeding of altcoins against both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The speaker argues that as long as Bitcoin's dominance remains below 49%, the altcoin market is in a holding pattern, with liquidity flowing from altcoins to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker claims that the upside target for the altcoin market this year is the low 400 billion dollar range, and that meme coins do not lead to real adoption, but rather exist to suck in liquidity. The speaker advises against \"marrying\" altcoins, as most are likely to go to zero, and suggests focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum as the cryptocurrencies that will stand the test of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker provides numerous examples to illustrate the systematic bleeding of altcoins against Bitcoin and Ethereum. Coins like Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Chainlink (LINK), and Avalanche (AVAX) have all seen significant declines of 80% or more against their Bitcoin and Ethereum pairs. The speaker warns that this pattern can repeat, with altcoins potentially losing another 80% of their value, as seen in previous market cycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes that the altcoin Reckoning is not over, and that the collapse of the Ethereum-Bitcoin valuation is likely the event that will mark the end of this bearish phase. Until then, the speaker advises focusing on the \"blue chip\" cryptocurrencies of Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the altcoin market continues to bleed liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall sentiment is strongly bearish on the altcoin market, with the speaker repeatedly emphasizing the \"altcoin Reckoning\" and the systematic bleeding of altcoins against both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The main message and conclusion is that the best strategy is to focus on the more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, rather than speculating on altcoins or meme coins.\n",

      "the having year so you just we need to remember this aspect of it okay um and so I I will continue to say that that is is what I consider to be the most likely outcome that the altcoin Reckoning will continue and the definition remember is all coins bleed on their Bitcoin pairs USD pairs are relevant to me okay I still think they're likely going to go down and many will put in new lows but they're relevant you might and you are irrelevant and you might say well Ben what all coins are putting in new lows well I'm glad you asked okay there's plenty of them why don't we start with the letter a right algorand guess what new lows new lows already December lows were taken out in fact from its December low it's down 23 percent from his December law there's plenty of coins plenty of cryptocurrencies that are putting in new lows as we speak on their USD pairs total three has not yet but I still think there is a good risk a good chance that it will put in new lows and remember total three could put in new lows even if Bitcoin doesn't right even in a world where Bitcoin does not put in a new low let's say it puts in a higher low or a double bottom total three could still put in a new low and if Bitcoin puts in a new low in a recession because the FED doesn't print because inflation's so high and they say not yet not yet not yet if Bitcoin puts in a new low where does that leave the altcoin market right nowhere good one thing I think to think about a lot is with Bitcoin is you know it almost tested the 2019 high and it could still test it I mean it could still test don't get me wrong it could legitimately test it could go back down to 14K but this is something I think about the Bitcoin came within 10 of its 2019 High the altcoin market which has been bleeding a lot right would need to see a 69 drop from here to test the 2019 low now I don't know that I'm that bearish on the altcoin market one of the reasons is because total three includes stable coins so it would be somewhat reasonable to remove that from the equation the stable coin Market mostly is is usdt plus b which well BST is going is going down right um the market Capital that's going down for a while uh you also have the eye which is pretty small and then we also have um what is it a usdc right uh so it's crypto yeah and then ustc so this is the altcoin market and it's going down too so let's go look it's now out of 116 billion so it's basically taking out its March low right isn't it interesting how the stable coin Market is taking out its March low around the same time that a lot of all coins are taking out their March lows right the low back in March was 116 point two seven below here 116.23 so we already took out the March low and it looks like it's still trending down so if you look at this though it's about 100 billion and you know I mean it started at 150 billion it's at 116 billion give it a few more you know give it six more months it'll probably be at 100 billion so a hundred billion of total three is the stable coin Market so if the stablecoin market survives then you could you could argue that we'll add a hundred billion to this so this is at 100 billion right here at 100 billion 200 billion so 200 billion is here so if if the altcoin market were to visit that level it would still be another 39 drop from the current levels furthermore it would be a 30 drop from the prior low a 30 drop from the prior low for the altcoin market this initial drop was about a 75 74 drop or so so a lot of things to take in right I mean the all coin Reckoning is a serious matter I hope people have been able to uh protect themselves as much as they can I know it's hard because there's a lot of bear Market realities in the altcoin market they suck you back in only to roll over and and and get everyone wrecked once again so please be careful out there please do understand that I'm only telling you guys this because I have been wrecked in the altcoin market more times than I care to count I'm not here standing on a pedestal acting like I'm I'm better I just I'm I'm here saying guys listen I have been in crypto for a number of cycles and I have been wrecked on the altcoin market more times than I care to count and I would prefer to sit out of alts during the bear Market year and the pre-halving year for the most part and just wait it out right wait it out because I don't like getting I don't like getting wrecked in the altcoin market it's happened enough and you know at some point enough is enough so please understand my goal with these all coin Reckoning videos over the last 18 months is only to inform you of experiences that I have had it's not to say that it has to play out like this although it has it has been playing out pretty much how we generally thought it would um but it's to say this is what's happened in the past the altcoin market sucks in that liquidity and then it and then it it it just sort of moves on remember 2019 we had a mean coin rally and guess what Bitcoin came back down and crushed the entire asset class it's a lot of things a lot of things to think about when it comes to to the altcoin market and the risk in the altcoin market if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up again we do have the sale at into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptiverse.com and hopefully at least one person will start drawing their fives from the bottom we'll see you guys next time bye\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the real estate verse today we're going to carry out a systematic overview of many of the real estate charts that I have on my website to get a better understanding as to where the real estate market currently is if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptographers premium at into the cryptiverse.com let's go ahead and jump in so the real estate market is honestly not something I have a whole lot of experience with in fact I would guess that many of you are probably more experienced in the real estate market than I am so I do want to come at this from a perspective of you know trying to be humble because I'm not I'm not very knowledgeable about this space at all okay with that said you know at some point I think it would be nice to to more in you know more get into the real estate State market and that's why I have started to follow it over the last few years because I do find it to be an interesting asset class up until now throughout my investing career I've mostly just stuck with equities and cryptocurrencies and occasionally Commodities but for and again for the most part it's just been equities and cryptocurrencies haven't really dabbled too much in the real estate market um other than from you know for for personal for personal stuff so let's take a look at some of the real estate charts and and let's just go through them systematically again I don't really have any predictions on the real estate market because it's it's honestly not something that I've um you know that I'm that familiar with if we take a look at so we have the website here the macro we have a real estate section so I just want to go through some of them so the first one is the purchase only house price index for the United States and I'm gonna scroll down so you can read the descriptions of these if you want to I'm not going to go through every single one but this is an interesting one because you can see how I mean it does just generally go up with time um even it even went up throughout the entire.com crash okay so the real estate market certainly does not have to feel the same effects of of every single crash in the stock market I mean this was like a two and a half year bear Market back during the.com crash and the real estate market according to this never really skipped a beat and it wasn't until you know 2007 2008 where it really started to roll back over and it didn't fully bottom out until around 2011. okay now ever since then it started to move back up uh you can see that it moved up at a fairly healthy pace and then starting in you know in really March of 2020 or so may of 2020 it just shot up I wonder why right well you know you print six trillion dollars and people are gonna go look for a place to invest that and the real estate market is I mean historically over a very long period of time it has been a great place to to invest your money doesn't mean that there's not occasional bear markets right you can see we had a bear Market over here and note by the way that bear markets in real estate can last for years you know I mean the the last real one that we had according to this chart you know last from 2007 until 2011 but I think According to some charts it probably lasted even later 2012. also remember that it's a very localized thing I mean in some areas you probably didn't even see house prices go down that much during that time period whereas in other areas you probably saw them drop quite a bit so it is a very localized thing it's not like you know the real estate market in Austin is going to be the same as real estate market in New York or Miami or Los Angeles or you know anywhere right I mean it's going to be different no matter where you go um one of the interesting things though is when you look at this you can see that you know back over here in 2008 it sort of slowed down a little bit but then it kind of just slowly crept back up right like it slowed down and it almost seemed like it was gonna come back down and it sort of did right like you can see from from June of 06 to July it actually came back down a little bit which was the first time it had come back down a long time but then it more or less reversed course for another you know three quarters of a year or so so maybe three you know about three quarters or so it then started to go back up and it wasn't until the following year that it really started to come back down very quickly one way one thing we could do is look at a month over month percentage change okay and and you'll see right here right there was one month where it was negative and then what happened right it just it slowly scaled back up and then we saw the the the bottom of the real estate market fall out now where are we today because I mean today is a very interesting time we have interest rates that are are you know I mean the FED funds rates at five and a quarter uh we have 30-year fixed fixed mortgages approaching seven percent and if you look today what has happened you know it it scaled back some in mid last year but really ever since August or so it's been kind of slowly trending up although some of these months have actually been slightly down so you could more or less say it was down kind of went up sideways for a bit somewhere negative some were positive but recently it started going back up okay I mean that's that's an undeniable Trend I mean like you know no matter how you look at it right like the last couple of months has been going back up and I mean again over here we saw something I mean it sort of slowed down and that might have given people the impression that the real estate market was going to roll over but then it kind of you know just kept going back up for almost another year right not quite but almost another year it just started going back up and then in 2007 um it really started to fall down okay now remember I would say that there is some there there's some truth to the idea in my opinion that equities can go down and the real estate market can churn along right just fine but I don't think the reverse is true okay now there might be data out there to to disprove that and I would be willing to to change my stance if if presented with data that did disprove that but I would be you know my sort of thinking here and it's at least supported by at least this chart is that if the real estate market goes down then equities would likely go down with them one of the reasons I would think that is because a lot of people tie you know a lot of their net worth in real estate and if if the real estate market comes down a lot then the wealth effect I imagine would take take hold and and people will just be less willing to invest in Risk assets if if some of the you know if their entire net worth has gone down a lot because a lot of people do concentrate a lot of their net worth in real estate so I think you could make the case that while equities can go down and the real estate market not care if the real estate market goes down I think equities do care okay so I don't think you're gonna you're I don't think you'll typically see periods where real estate's going down you know significantly and equities keep going up without without skipping a beat I mean you can see here once the real estate market started to turn so too did did equities okay but again recently it started going back up if you look at the month over month percentage change you can see we did get you know a couple negative months right here we had another couple of negative months right here but recently it has gone back up to the upside now if you look at the year over year percentage change that tells a slightly different story uh mainly because you know while it has gone up some recently I mean if you if you if you look at this has gone up some recently it's still significantly different than the prior Trend it was on I mean the prior Trend was basically just almost vertical you know I mean just going going straight up um but now this has certainly slowed down a lot so when you look at a year over year percentage change you might look at this in your initial reaction and I've seen this happen on Twitter a lot as well right you see something going down therefore you think it's Contracting that's not true right this is the derivative right it's a it's a year-over-year percentage change and so as long as it's above the zero line it's still you know the year over year percentage change is still going up it it's just going up at a slower Pace it's like when you see when you talk about inflation right if inflation's eight percent one month and then seven percent the next month it doesn't mean you're experiencing deflation it means you're experiencing disinflation you have you still have inflation right it's just inflation isn't as bad as it was the prior month so in this case the year-over-year percentage change is still positive from March 23 to March 22. it's just that the percentage the rate at which it's gone up is going the the rate at which it's going up is going it has been going down okay so you know at one point back in February of 2022 you can see that the market was up you know 19 or so year over year now it's only up about three and a half percent year over year and if it continues this trend then it wouldn't take too much longer for it to go negative although you could argue that it it's starting to level out a little bit and and it it might start um you know not it might start to to sort of uh come into some type of a base right it doesn't have to just go immediately negative it could come down to these levels over here which is still growth even if it's not um even if it's not as high growth as we saw once upon a time okay but that is of a a very interesting chart to me because um you know you can see that it started to go back up has that happened before yeah it happened back over here it went up for another year or so uh and then and then the market finally started to turn but even when it even when it turns I mean it's such a long process I mean you know this whole this whole process here of slowing down was in February of 06 and it didn't even really get back to that point until basically February of 08 I mean it's a couple years so this Market this Market moves very very slowly um we can also take a look at the Zillow home value index so if you take a look at that I mean it more or less tells a a the same story uh except for I mean if you look over here kind of plateaued went sideways for quite a long period of time and then slowly started to go back down um where is it right now right it kind of plateaued here it went back down for a little bit it started to slowly go back up recently if we look at a month over month percentage change you can see that it's currently at around point three percent or so so it's still slightly less than probably the average over here but it's not it's not it's not as bad as it was right it's not a negative territory so you actually have seen that to go back going back up as well recently looking at mortgage rates always something interesting um you know 30-year fixed latest a 6.71 percent so you know if you think about mortgage rates one of the reasons I think you could argue that the prices went down at the end of last year or sorry mid last year going into the third and fourth quarter maybe the third quarter is because there was a sort of like people were just shocked by high interest rates right and so a lot of people didn't want to buy houses um and and so the demand dropped okay but I think the issue right now for for the FED is that demand is has started to come back some um and it's not necessarily like insane demand but I imagine a lot a large part of it is just there's not a lot of Supply on the market right so the demand isn't that high uh because interest rates are higher but there's not a whole lot of supply and so with the demand that there is it's sufficient to you know to keep prices um out very you know at pretty elevated levels uh just because no one really wants a lot of people don't want to sell um and who can blame them I mean if you locked in a more you know 30-year fixed at like three percent or less then it you know it would be a hard a hard choice to to make a move especially if you plan on buying another house because if you're gonna buy another house and you have to go from paying three percent to paying seven percent that's a that's a big decision right you're basically going to have the same a same the same monthly payment for a house that's a lot less expensive so I mean it's hard for hard people to make that move now I imagine there are circumstances that do require it there's always going to be people moving for a job um so you know there's there's always going to be people that are going to be selling and buying uh there could be major life events that could be going on or people get laid off and and sometimes people just can't afford it and so maybe they sell their house but they're not looking to buy another one they might be become a renter or something um so that's something to think about I mean 30-year fix is at is at 6.71 you can see it's actually been trending slightly high recently our arguably the the you know people are starting to get used to higher interest rates as well you know one of the things I mentioned on on one of the prior videos that we did on real estate maybe eight months ago or so I don't know was you know I said one of the things we talked about is how you know six or seven percent in the in the context of History isn't really that high it's just it's high to Millennials because we haven't really experienced anything different but in the context of history I mean like my you know when I when I talk to people that are um a generation older than me you know getting a house and having like a 13 12 13 14 mortgage was pretty normal now the Counterpoint of course is that house prices were a lot lower so it it was a a bit easier to you know to to go into something like that um but but the rates were were a lot higher at the time now we have really high rates and much higher prices so I it's it's of course very difficult for a lot of people um to to Really jump into into Home Ownership although there are some charts that suggest that home ownership continues to stay on the rise if we look out at things like delinquency rates on real estate secured loans you can see that it's still pretty low okay at this time I mean it's still pretty low it has slightly ticked up recently but um not a whole lot I mean you can also see that it went up slightly during the.com crash but it wasn't really a huge impact on the real estate market as a whole um so nothing really too significant to look at here and again if you look at say like a year-over-year change it is starting to get close to that positive territory which historically isn't great for markets if it were to do something like that um but it's not there yet and at the current Pace uh it would still take a few months uh just to even even get to that point even if it were even if delinquencies were to still go up if we look at the net percentage of domestic Banks reporting stronger demand for Real Estate phones this is one of the things that shows you how how um how little demand there is right this is for commercial real estate I mean look at this right it's it's Dow I mean it's at negative 67.2 percent so again this is the net percentage of domestic Banks reporting stronger demand negative 67 right so the demand has not been nearly what it you know what it used to be um but but the real estate market at this time at least a residential real estate still holding strong I know some commercial real estate is is starting to get into some trouble um if we look at residential sales the sales price of houses sold so if we look at the median you can see that it actually has gone down recently okay so this is um uh quarterly data right so you can see like you know q1 of 2022 Q2 Q3 and Q4 there's a big drop from Q4 to q1 a big drop and we don't often see major drops like that so looking at say a quarter over quarter percentage change this is pretty significant right I mean there's actually in in all the data that we're tracking here I I'm not seeing a period where the quarter over quarter percentage change was as low as it is right now if we look at a year over year percentage change you can see that it's currently at 0.854 percent okay now there's only a few times in in in over the last several decades that it's even gone negative right I mean we have the 19 or the early 1970s we have over here during 1982 where it went negative you can see that it went negative back in the 90s early 90s and then also of course in 2007 2008 um and then there was a period of a brief period right here where it went negative in 2011 and then also of course in 2019 and and um and you know just you know in that 2019 period late 2018 early 2019 and mid 2019. what's interesting is that normally when this goes negative you can see that the stock market doesn't really like that a whole lot right when it goes negative the the doesn't necessarily mean that it's like a major crash by the stock market uh there's a period in 2016. um or sorry there's a period where was it it was it was right here in the early 1990s where you know the market the market had a a nice little correction when the real estate market median sells the prices uh price of houses sold in the United States went negative but I mean the stock market did pick back up once the housing market picked back up but again usually when it goes negative um it hasn't been a great thing right now it's not negative it's it's still slightly positive but I imagine that it it you know next quarter this could certain this could certainly go negative I mean this is a big drop too is when you think about I mean this was from 13.2 percent to 0.854 over one quarter so you add a couple more you know add two or three more quarters on here good chance you're gonna see this you know see this go negative if um if that pace continues if we look at the new single family homes sold you can see that actually been going up recently okay and and maybe looking at a year over year percentage change as actually positive okay so from this perspective it looks like the housing market in the short term has picked back up a little bit and there's no denying it I mean no it could it could go back down um again I'm not I'm not an expert on real estate by any search of the imagination but I do know that there's some seasonality to it right I mean I think a lot of a lot of listings go up and sort of the springtime and and a lot of people are buying in the spring and summer and then as you get later on into the year uh maybe it's not as you know not as as um popular but I don't I don't really know I'm not I'm not that plugged into that if we look at new houses for sale oversold ratio you can see that actually it has been coming down right I mean it's been coming down so much quickly if we look at it say a quarter over quarter percentage change you can see that it's negative we've had plenty of periods where this thing was negative if you look at a year-over-year percentage change there haven't been as many periods as it was negative as when you look at quarter over quarter but do note that it has entered into that negative territory at negative 10.59 however this metric does not always correspond to Major drops in inequities right and there's periods where this goes negative and it doesn't really mean it doesn't really mean anything for the equity you know for equities or you know the stock market in general so not not put too much weight to put there one thing that I I suppose you could say that higher interest rates have caused is that the amount of\n",

      "quarter but do note that it has entered into that negative territory at negative 10.59 however this metric does not always correspond to Major drops in inequities right and there's periods where this goes negative and it doesn't really mean it doesn't really mean anything for the equity you know for equities or you know the stock market in general so not not put too much weight to put there one thing that I I suppose you could say that higher interest rates have caused is that the amount of months it takes to sell a new home has been going back up so we we were at a a level of about one and a half months so and I don't even know where that's coming from I mean I guess on average maybe it was one and a half months but from where I'm sitting and what I was looking out on the market most of the um most of the houses that you were you you know you would see get listed that were you know somewhat decent houses were going almost immediately but I guess there are a lot of homes that might not be as desirable and and those of course could sit on the market for a number of months so the average it ended up being 1.5 here at the lowest point in late 2022 but it has come back up and now it's currently setting at 2.8 but if you zoom in here you can see that it hit 2.8 last month and then it hit 2.8 again so uh this is still I mean the housing market is still you know somewhat tight in that sense is it you know the houses aren't really sitting for very low long um the issue is just that there aren't a lot of houses available okay so you have a situation where you know demand there's still some demand even at higher rates maybe people want to make cash maybe people just don't care about paying a higher higher interest rate um but you don't have a ton of inventory and so you know we're kind of in a sticky situation there if we look at housing starts like housing units started you can see that it's actually been trending down since um you know really since early 2022 a year over year percentage change shows you that it's currently negative and you can see prior periods when it was negative here on the chart and I mean again normally normally risk assets don't like this but again there are periods where it didn't really seem to matter right so you can find examples where it did matter you can find examples where it didn't matter there's plenty of periods over here in the 90s where it went negative and it didn't really seem to matter much at all okay I mean if it goes very negative right like 2000 2009 or like in 1975 five or in you know 1970 or so right if it gets very negative then I imagine it would have some type of more material effect on risk Assets in general due to things like the wealth effect that we previously talked about and if we look at housing units under construction you can see that it's also potentially found a a local top but it's really hard to know because you know I suppose you could make the case that it's it's it's going to slowly come back down last month it actually went back up a little bit so you could make the case that it's sort of in this process here the Counterpoint of course is that there is a period back over here in the 1980s where it sort of started to roll over um in in 84 and then it just started to pick back up again it didn't really started downtrend until 86. so again that was another another two year period where it seemed like it was about to go down but then it actually went back up before actually and then coming to coming down quite a lot and if you look at a year-over-year percentage change of this metric you can in fact see that significant moves to the downside on this do tend to correspond to recessions okay you know you have exhibit a exhibit B and C and and so on and so forth okay so when you get when you get major moves like this it does tend to correspond to recessions which of course is the gray shaded region on the chart right now this metric is currently at 0.359 percent so it's it's in danger of going negative but it's not negative just yet and you'll note that there are several periods over here where I just went slightly negative and and then the market just sort of picked back up again okay so going negative isn't even really that big of a deal it's it's if it goes to say you know like negative 30 or something um that tends to be an ominous sign for for the economy in general like negative 20 negative 30 that's more of a more of an issue right now uh you know it's at 0.359 the month before it was at 2.27 before that it was at 6.64 if you were to look at a month over month percentage change um you can you can see that we have had some negative months although it has not been that detrimental just yet and then finally I wanted to look at this chart this is an interesting chart the home ownership rate because it actually is kind of interesting because it it tells you something that might not be that obvious like in the home ownership rate meaning uh if you're not familiar I mean it's just the the proportion of households that are owner occupied that's actually been going up um I mean it found sort of a local bottom here back in in the summer at 21 it's actually been going up recently so I know a lot of people feel priced out of homes and and not and not and wishing they could afford one uh right now home ownership has has been back on the Rise um so people's people have been uh you know still still buying homes and whatnot and when you can see it was back in in 2004 and 2005 it was only up here at around uh 69 or so back in in um you know March of 2020 it was uh rather our April's around 67.9 but again it's it's just still is slowly going up right now do note that the level that it currently is at is actually the same level that it was at back in the early 1980s when we also had a period of high inflation and where we actually had to uh two recessions back to back to actually get that inflation under control if you look at owner's equity level in Real Estate you can see that you know I mean it generally Trends higher there are periods where it goes down one of the periods where it went down was of course back in 2007 and 2008 2009 and you can see that it bottomed out here in about early 2012. now this again this normally goes up right if I put this on a log scale you can see that it normally goes up but there are times where it goes down like back over here and also recently it actually has been going down okay but the rate at which it's been going down looks to be um you know getting getting better right like it's not getting worse and you could picture that by looking at a quarter over quarter percentage change right like you can see that the first quarter it was was pretty negative at negative one point let me switch to a percentage it was at negative 4.68 then negative 3.42 the negative 2.23 so it has been going down but the rate at which it's been going down um has has been uh decreasing right like it hasn't been going down as as much as or at least the rate hasn't been as bad as it was but again I mean it still is going down and if you look at a again if you look at a year-over-year percentage change when it when it goes negative like this historically it's not a great sign um but even in that case I mean it can take a long time to play out I mean look at look at this back in in the doc uh or in the financial crisis you can see that it went and first went negative in 2006 but we know that the market you know the real estate or the equity Market didn't really start to turn until a year later in October of 2007. so this just went negative here in in I mean you can see that it just went negative here in January of 2023 right this is a quarter quarterly quarterly thing uh and it just went negative um last quarter okay so again these these these things take a long time to play out and I guess the question is does it play more out like one of these where it's it's sort of just down here and then right back up or does it go a lot deeper like we did during the during the financial crisis if you look at the rental vacancy rate um you know it's actually been going down uh ever since 2009 recently it's starting going back up right so like since January of 2022 or so early 2022 you can see it's it really started to go back up it hit a low here in October 2021 at 5.6 and then a double bottom here at 5.6 in April 2022 and then it's been slowly turning higher and it's currently sitting at 6.4 percent if you look at a year over year change of that you can see that it has in fact gone positive right um which of course is not not a healthy sign if they're if they're if the vacancy rate is going up right that's not a not a good sign um but that's where it currently sits and then the last thing is is kind of an interesting metric that furniture and Home Furnishing Furnishing sales um very cyclical metric right very cyclical and you can see that it normally tops out here at the end of the year as it's reported right December um and I mean right now it's it's kind of hard to read honestly like on on shorter time frames but um I mean if you look at it sort of from like a uh a bird's eye view let me remove the price of the s p and recessions as well um it has slowed down some right like this pace that it was going up at seems to have slowed down some but I also don't think you can look at this and say that it's entered into a sustained um period of contraction right like it's hard to know at this point it could be rolling over but it's also hard to know uh just because we don't really have a whole lot of data anyways I think we'll wrap it up there this is my you know these are some of the charts we have on the real estate market again I'm not an expert at it just wanted to talk about uh what's going on in the real estate market provides some opinions and and just try to become a little bit more aware of what's going on and maybe in the future I will uh I'll get into the real estate market myself anyways if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptiverse today we're going to talk about ethereum dubious speculation if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptivorous premium at into the cryptiverse.com let's go ahead and jump in if you are familiar with my channel over the last year and a half I have maintained my view that ethereum will ultimately head home now of course this view has been met with a lot of criticism especially over the last several months but really since 2022 started back over here we've talked about the idea that ethereum would ultimately find itself back home or within the lower fair value regression band that is my general expectation for ethereum okay now I want to talk about a few things clearly it has not gone there yet despite the fact that we are about a year and a half out from when 2022 started so that might lead some to believe that it will never happen and of course there's always a chance that it doesn't we should be open-minded to the idea that any potential outcome could in fact occur although with that said I do think it's worthwhile to plan for what we consider to be the most likely outcome and for me the most likely outcome at least where I'm planning the most is for the ethereum evaluation to ultimately make its way back home some people also might be under the illusion that these assets only go down during the primary bear Market years for Bitcoin which are 2014 2018 and 2022 but I will remind you that ethereum had in fact a 75 correction from 2019 until early 2020. for reference a 75 correction from ethereum's most recent high would put it at around 500 or so so I think there is this idea that just because we're in the prehabbing year it doesn't mean that ethereum can't have another sizable correction back to the downside to get it back within the lower regression Trend within the lower regression logarithmic or the lower regression trend line right there is a chance of course that that could happen now one of the things I want to mention is the the bounds here on the regression trend line are currently from around 599 up to 1255 with the fair value currently coming in at around 867. interestingly enough the fair value is almost where the prior local bottom was now I would say that there is a good chance that ethereum could take out that low if we do Fade the second half of the year in a similar way as we did in 2019 one thing that we've talked about at length is how in the pre having years for Bitcoin what you'll often see is the Bulls get wrecked and the Bears Get Wrecked so right you you wreck the Bears first you you give the Bulls the false sense of security that the asset will only go up and then you spend the second half of the Year wrecking the the Bulls right so you wreck the Bears and then you wreck the Bulls by the end of the year both bulls and bears are sufficiently wrecked that is the general expectation for the pre-halving year now one of the most common retorts that I see are are along the lines of people saying things like well you know no one's expecting it to happen therefore it will happen right like no one's expecting it to go to a new high therefore it will guys believe me the same stuff was said in 2019 and by the way we also had a meme coin rally back then too and and then what happened the Blue Chips of the space mainly Bitcoin back then arguably Bitcoin and ethereum today punished the asset class by going back down and guess what happened those all coins got absolutely decimated not only on their USD pairs but also on their Bitcoin pairs many of them on their ethereum pairs as well why because there's not liquidity there's not much liquidity in the altcoin market right the the liquidity from the altcoin market is probably what keeping Bitcoin and you ethereum propped up at the valuations that they are but at some point liquidity dries up people get tired of getting rugged from all these scams that are out there and they just leave and once the liquidity dies up then what was once holding up the blue chips that source of liquidity has sort of dried up and it can no longer sustain it and then the asset class as a whole comes back down right so all coins bleed to the blue chips for a while just like we've seen over in tech stocks the mega cap tech stocks have been the ones that have been doing the best at some point I think you see things roll over and then everything gets crushed um but with ethereum right now you know a 75 correction just like it got back over here in in 2019 2020 would put it well within the fair value regression trend line and it might even put it slightly below I mean Bitcoin went below it so there's no guarantee that ethereum can't do the same thing now you might say why does it have to go down 75 percent you know this initial impulsive move by ethereum back in in 2018 was a 95 move but then this one over here was only like an 82 percent move so could there be some LM element of diminishing losses you have 95 to 90 or 95 to 82 therefore is there a chance that this 75 percent move is is or the is there a chance that the fade that we potentially see in the second half of the year is is a tempered version of what we saw back over here hey that's a decent idea and perhaps we should explore it we could explore the ratios right and we could say um we could say you have 95 everyone loves how I draw the fives although I contend that it's the right way to dry I mean look everyone wants to draw their fives like this right but if you're if you're riding a if you're riding a um a five let's say you're riding a nine right and you write the nine and you end it down here it makes the most sense to just start the five from down here it's the most efficient way right it's not efficient to like write a nine and then have to come all the way back up here and then write a five it's more efficient to to do it the other way so I will uh I will stand by that so you have 95 percent divided by 75 man I get to write five a lot then equals 82. over X right so what is X solve for x so you have you basically have 95 divided by 75 equals 82 sorry equals 82 divided by X we're just going to solve for x x is uh 1 12 30 over 19 we'll get the approximate form it turns out it's a 64 correction so let's suppose that it fades it in the same way that it faded it back over here and and you solve for x and it gives you a 65. man I get to write five again you get a 65 correction okay what would a 65 correction do to ethereum from this high well it would put it at 745 745 is where a 65 correction will put it which would in fact be a lower low and I've contended for a long time that ethereum could put in a lower low in a potential recession guys this was a recession over here right back in in 2020 and the FED printed immediately what happens if we get a recession and the FED does not print immediately right that's how I think you could see something like this play out so a 65 correction would put Eve at a lower low and it would at least get it close to the fair value I mean even if it's like a sixty percent correction it could get it back to the prior low and get it back home okay so that is is what I think is in fact the most likely outcome now we can look at the ethereum Bitcoin pair and I know what a lot of you guys are thinking right what's it all what's it doing at 0.07 and it's basically a 0.07 well my thesis here and it's taking a lot longer than I thought no doubt about it right receipts are there I've been saying forever that the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is going to go down I would rationalize it in my own mind which again I know is a somewhat desperate attempt but I would rationalize it and say technically these are lower highs so technically has it really been wrong to assume the ethereum Bitcoin valuation will fade I don't think so but also technically speaking you could say that the ethereum Bitcoin valuation has been going sideways for the better part of two years one way to visualize this look at the 50-week SMA the 50 week has basically just been going sideways at around .07 in fact it is the 50 week that we are testing right now the same area for the 50 week was where the 50 week moved down back over here in 2018. so I am still under the impression that the ethereum Bitcoin valuation will fade I'm also under the impression that the ethereum Bitcoin collapse will likely Mark the end of the altcoin Reckoning when you look back at the last cycle and we sort of draw a trend line across here what marks the end of the altcoin Reckoning what marked the end of it was it this move no this was late 2017. was it this one no wasn't this marked the the bottom for many altcoins on their USD Pairs and not all of them and it marked the bottom for Bitcoin USD but it did not Mark the bottom for the the it did not Mark the end of the altcoin Reckoning the altcoin Reckoning really did not stop until the ethereum Bitcoin valuation finally bottomed way over here if you were to take a similar type of view this cycle and say that this here is sort of your initial your initial test I think at some point we're going to get the secondary test now remember this time frame back over here from the first test to the second test sorry I got the price let me get the time frame here from test a to test B was what it was 54 weeks from this test here how far out are we we're it 49 weeks I put forth the idea that the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is going to be testing these levels in the coming weeks okay one or two months I think it could happen legitimately I think the ethereum Bitcoin valuation could be testing 0.05 within the next month or two you know when you think about it back in in May of 2018 when when the ethereum Bitcoin valuation was just chilling at 0.08.09 do you think we were sitting there thinking it was going to be at 0.02 in in half a year no okay this is not a thing right most people did not assume it's going to go to 0.02 back then um in fact we still had people saying that it was it was doing relatively well and it was still didn't stop it from collapsing and it was the ethereum Bitcoin valuation secondary collapse not the first one that actually marks the low it marks the low for Bitcoin things don't have to play out the same way but I'm telling you there are a lot of cyclical components to the cryptoverse and I do feel somewhat convinced still that the ethereum Bitcoin evaluation will bleed back down and and it should Mark the sort of the final stages of the altcoin Reckoning so if it follows you could see it move back down uh perhaps it gets a bounce I bounce back up and then it goes down again but this move to the downside could come on a Bitcoin rally not a Bitcoin dump right I mean it you know this this move over here was sort of uh this ethereum Bitcoin valuation bleed was a Bitcoin rally not not a DOT I mean part of it was is Bitcoin fading but still I I put forth this idea that the altcoin Reckoning could end when the ethereum Bitcoin valuation finally collapses so um that's still my view it has been my view and it will continue to be my view and I don't see any compelling reason to change it at this point someone might say well you know technically it's holding up and hey technically you're right but technically speaking it's been putting in lower highs since since 2021 and technically speaking it's been putting in lower highs since 2017. okay if we're being technically correct which is of course the best way to be correct the other way to look at this of course is the ethereum Bitcoin market cap actually before we do that I want to show you one more perspective here on the ethereum Bitcoin valuation and that's to look at the monthly the 20 month estimate this is something we followed a lot back in 2019-2020 and and I just want to mention it so if you remember we we called for this rally by Ether Bitcoin we said we'll fall back down at the end of 2020 right we we thought that we would because Bitcoin was going parabolic and normally Q4 is bitcoin's time to shine if it's if it's a bull market we held support at the 20 months I thought that we were fading it here back you know a year ago that's when I thought it was done I did not I underestimated the strength that you know that it would have going into the merge still though it was a lower high okay now instead of getting one monthly close below the 20 month we have had several monthly closes and perhaps this is the back test of it just like this was the back test in the bull market okay so this could just be simply the back test of the 20 month before It ultimately Fades now what would cause it to fade one of the reasons I think it could fade is because liquidity from the altcoin market is drying up so people that maybe were converting their alts to ethereum they'll be unable to do that as efficiently because the altcoin market liquidity is just simply drawing up so I would put forth the idea again that this is just a back test potentially of the 20-month I mean we did have Wix here but that it should ultimately fade back down maybe bounce back up and then go lower once again and then the ethereum Bitcoin valuation could just be seen potentially uh one of two ways uh one way is on a logarithmic regression trend line sort of slope these are not I mean these are just curves that I'm drawing just for um convenience right one way to look at it is like that and then the other way is is an oscillator which there is a chance I mean there's a chance that it it could just be some type of of oscillator and this is sort of just the initial capitalization okay so the other way to look at this of course is to just look at the ethereum market cap divided by the Bitcoin market cap and what do you notice here right it just to me it seems like an oscillator we don't have the data on the market cap going back to to 2015 but you can imagine it was down here uh when the before the ethereum evaluation took off uh it came up it came down it came back up I think we are likely going to go back down if you look at the bull market support ban on the ethereum Bitcoin market cap you can see we're slightly above it right now although we still have um uh some time here before you know before the week is over and you can sometimes get these sort of these brief fake outs just to get everyone excited only for it to just eventually be another lower high right so when you think about the ethereum valuation um one of the reasons I think that the Bitcoin dominance has not broken 49 is because the ethereum valuation against Bitcoin has not taken the plunge but I've said before I think in the end even the Giants will fall even the ethereum Bitcoin valuation I do think will eventually fall with that said it has been holding up uh somewhat admirably and and if you look at things like the Bitcoin and the ethereum dominance combined they continue to look relatively healthy I would say that there's a good chance that ethereum uh is I mean I I do think ethereum has has more or less cemented itself as a blue chip but that doesn't mean that it can't collapse against Bitcoin okay I do think I do still think that that is in fact the most likely outcome one of the things we talked about before again is is sort of fading this area here if you go and look at say the ROI of ethereum after cycle Peak you'll see and we talked we did a video on it at the time right we talked about how in in 2019 the ethereum USD sort of rally in 2019 peaked on day 529 from the peak this one here peaked at around 524 and ever since then it's just been slowly fading so we could just continue to slowly fade what we saw last cycle until we come all the way back down and then we go up after we get through this recession scare and these macro headwinds after the altcoin Reckoning is over and so on and so forth but at this point I I don't think that we can get out of this without fading this rally and coming back down and sort of retesting some of those levels and and potentially even going to a new low I do think that there's reason to be concerned about that um especially considering how quickly the economy is slowing down I also see liquidity is drying up as well you can see it in the cryptoverse and and the other thing to look at is how and we've talked about this in some of the other videos as well is how total three uh has been a sort of it it kind of tells you where the market is going right so is is liquidity coming into the cryptoverse supporting the bull run or is it not okay and and you can see again in 2020 total three was above the 20 week but in 2019 total three fell below it in July Bitcoin fell below its 20 week over here in September while it was holding it in 2020. so you could argue that total three is is giving us the warning signs that Bitcoin USD could in fact fall below its bull market sport band and if it does do that then I believe nine out of nine times from weekly close below the 20 week to weekly close above by Bitcoin the ethereum Bitcoin valuation has more or less blood or been somewhat even or or equal all but usually it bleeds so I I do think that if you start to get these weekly closes below the 20 week estimate for Bitcoin then you'll you'll likely see something very similar play out for ethereum where it would likely get these weekly closes below and normally once Bitcoin Falls below ethereum tends to move a lot quicker to the downside than Bitcoin does you might argue that ethereum held up better in the bear Market but that's not true actually um this might have been a higher low but you also need to remember that this first low was 82 percent down whereas Bitcoins even it's November low from its high was only 77 down so so far ethereum has not held up better than than Bitcoin although a lot of people would have you believe that it has because they'll they'll look at the ethereum Bitcoin valuation but I have to ask you right if if ethereum has been holding up so well against Bitcoin then please try to explain why is the ethereum Bitcoin valuation unable to put in new highs okay why if it's holding up better it's it's an illusion right it's not holding up better it just you know the moves to the downside are so quick that then you spend you know a month or two slightly going back up and it makes you think that the asset that that this asset pair only goes up but in reality it's just that the the down portions are so quick that you know the emotions tied to that downward move are fleeting and then you spend the next one or two months going up everyone gets excited only for it to be another lower high and then what happens right it just Fades back to the downside once again and then everyone gets bearish and then it goes back up and then everyone everyone gets bullish again it just ends up being a lower high and then it goes down and puts in a new low so I don't see it being any different I do think that um the ethereum dominance has been impressive to say the least okay so to give credit where credit is due uh if I if we just pull up the ethereum dominance if I can find it on here you can see that it's currently near 21 so the ethereum dominance has been doing quite well um and I'm not trying to take that away from it I mean you can look at a lot of these all coins and guess what they're just bleeding on their ether pairs I mean like a to Ether it's just been bleeding for a long time Ave ether bleeding avax ether bleeding dot ether bleeding BNB ether going down link ether horrendous and so on and so forth okay the awkward Market is bleeding to ethereum that's true but ethereum is bleeding to bitcoin all right it is I mean maybe not today maybe not last week or last month but since 2021 it is in fact lower highs and I would put forth the idea too that if it gets rejected once again and comes back down to these June lows from last year then then you\n",

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the macroverse today we're going to talk about gross domestic income or GDI if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out into the cryptiverse premium uh into the cryptiverse.com you can of course get access to a lot of the macro charts that we frequently discuss on the channel let's go ahead and jump in so I imagine there are some people that are not as familiar with gross domestic income now you've probably heard of gross domestic product or GDP and you've probably heard of real GDP but GDI is actually something that's that's a bit different now the definition of GDI is its measures the total income generated by a country uh and it provides an alternative perspective to gross domestic product by focusing on the income earned by various entities including individuals businesses in the government now specifically though if we can narrow it down to how does it differ between to when compared to GDP GDI aims to measure what the economy makes or takes in such as wages profits and taxes whereas GDP seeks to measure what the economy produces like good services and Technology okay and a lot of economists will actually use both GDP and GDI to get a gauge on the economy and sometimes they'll average the two to get a gauge of the economy now what's interesting is that if you remember back to early 2022 to the first half of 2022 a lot of people used the two consecutive quarters of negative GDP to to sort of provide evidence as to the idea that we were in a recession right these two consecutive quarters of negative GDP however I've been quite vocal that I do not think that that constitutes a recession namely because you don't really have a recession when the unemployment rate is just sort of hanging out at secular lows now it doesn't mean that it can't eventually go up and it doesn't mean we can't go into a recession that eventually but just because you have two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP in my opinion is not sufficient to argue that the economy is in a recession in fact the U.S economy has been quite resilient for quite a long period of time now if you go look at gross domestic income and we look at the quarter over quarter percentage change has it turned negative at all you will see that it has not okay now remember this is not real GDI this is just GDI again real GDP did turn negative quarter over quarter GDP right not right not real GDP but just GDP um did not turn negative so you can see that there is a distinction here if you adjust for you know if you adjust for inflation it makes a difference doesn't make a difference for GDI so if you look at the quarter over quarter change here for GDI you will see that there's periods in history where it did go negative and typically when it goes negative it corresponds to a recession hasn't gone negative yet right this is this is not real GDI again this is still nominal there are a couple of instances where it went slightly negative like in 2012 and in 2007 and in 1959 where it went negative but it did not actually correspond to a recession at least not immediately although you can see that in 2007 we did get a recession not too long after so far it has not gone negative interestingly there's a period here in the 70s where we had several recessions even though GDI was nowhere close to really being negative but again what's similar today and the 70s we have high inflation we also had you know High inflation back in the 1970s so if you adjust for inflation you will in fact see that real GDI quarter over quarter percentage change did go negative throughout the 19 late you know for throughout the 1970s and even early 1980s and every time it went negative during this period with the exception of 1979 it immediately corresponded to a recession here is an example where it didn't immediately correspond to one we sort of kicked the can down the road for a couple of quarters and then we ended up getting a recession right so and then we ended up getting another recession not too long after that just to make sure that inflation was in fact under control so there's plenty of examples in history when the quarter over quarter uh percentage change of GDI going negative does correspond to a recession though there are some instances as we've discussed where it doesn't necessarily mean you have to have it imminently it could still be delayed by a couple of quarters interestingly if you look at the quarter over quarter percentage change of real GDI you will see that we've actually had two consecutive quarters of negative GDI recently and again this was updated here May 25th so not that long ago so we also had a negative quarter back in April of 2022. now we can also look at the year over year percentage change of real GDI and if you look at it like this you will see that we just had it go negative in January of 2023 and in in October 22 it was also negative but in July it was it was slightly positive so when you look at it like this the year-over-year percentage change you will see that that typically corresponds to a downturn in the economy as well and now this has only just begun right I mean so yes it's gone negative but it could stay negative for quite some time right it doesn't have to just turn back up immediately it could stay negative for a while in fact back in 2007 you can see that it turned negative you know around you know sort of halfway through the year and it didn't really get back into positive territory until a couple of years later so just because it's gone negative now doesn't mean that it can't stay negative for for many quarters to come but I did think that looking at GDI as well as GDP can be insightful into understanding is the economy slowing down or not and right now GDI does give us the impression that things are really starting to slow down especially when you adjust for inflation if you don't adjust for inflation it doesn't really look as bad right it doesn't really look as bad but if you know if if you really want to get to the bottom of it right I mean adjusting for inflation would seem to make sense and you can also more easily compare to Prior times where inflation was an issue and we can make we can make easier comparisons as to as to how this metric was performing during various periods when you sort of exclude the inflationary components of it right if you if you just say hey we're going to include inflation and just get it nominally um then then it can lead you to believe that the economy is doing better than it really is but if you actually actually incorporate inflation into the metric and say all right we're going to adjust for inflation then you can get a better a better insight into what's actually going on in the economy you know are things going up because the economy is expanding or is it just going up because we have inflation right I think that's an important consideration to make I think we'll go ahead and wrap it up there we'll make this one a shorter video I just wanted to introduce you guys to gross domestic income and so now you're aware that this is also a metric that you can use and you can follow and again make sure you subscribe if you're not subscribed give the video a thumbs up I'll see you guys

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the equity verse today we're going to talk about the S P 500 risk metric if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out into the crypto various premium at into the cryptoverse.com you can sign up and get access to charts like this one you're probably familiar with the idea of a risk metric we've talked about it with Bitcoin before especially within the context of things like the price risk the on-chain risk and the social risk you might be familiar with with this chart here but we can also use the same types of principles to to navigate equities and we've even talked about the S P 500 risk metric before in fact it was back in March of 2020 that we put out a video on on the S P 500 risk and the risk on it at the time was very low in fact back then the risk if you go and look at the local low here was at 0.29 9-3 so at 0.29 risk now the S P 500 does not typically go to risk levels that are that low okay going below the 0.3 risk level is not something that happens that frequently and so when it happens you're usually based on historical data you know it's usually best um to consider some type of of approach of gaining exposure within the asset class if history is an indication to get us not Financial advice but I do want to point out that the current risk on the s p is at 0.572 now where have we been recently if we zoom in to recent you know recent history you'll see that the lowest we've gone was back in you know September October of 2022 in recent history around that .36 risk level and back in 2021 we were all the way up at around 0.8 to 0.9 risk so pretty heated and it showed that look this Market was going to likely experience some headwinds because we don't often spend that much time at these extremely elevated risk levels right you can see that it does sometimes happen but it doesn't it's often not sustained for a very long periods of time now very long periods of time can be somewhat subjective you know does it mean a couple days or a few weeks in crypto when we're at high risk level we tend to only spend a few days there maybe a few weeks tops within the s p you can spend months at high risk levels I mean you can spend quite a quite a long period of time at those risk levels because the market can remain somewhat irrational for for long periods of time and that's why you see that's why you'll see the S P 500 risk stay at a fairly high level for a longer period of time um then you'll then you see then you will see with crypto but anyways we can see that the S P 500 risk metric it started to diverge back in August of 2021 compared to the price right so the price slowly trended just a bit higher but the s p started to really fall over here and go and go quite a bit lower now the way you navigate markets is is of course you know it's dependent on you right there's no solution that's going to fit every investor oftentimes on Twitter you will see people make fun or sort of criticize certain strategies that don't align with their own but we almost remember that we're all in different phases of our life some people are willing to take on more risk some people are willing to take on less risk and because of that I think it's it's prudent to come up with a strategy that suits you the most right so in this case what it would mean is identifying a risk level that you are comfortable dcing into the market and then identifying a risk level that you might want to DCA out of the market now when it comes to crypto I am a lot more um you know I'm a lot more aggressive with DCA out of the market at high risk levels for instance when Bitcoin went to The 0.91 Wristband back in you know back in early 2021 that was where I mostly got out of the market now I did reaccumulate some back in the Summer with the expectation that we would go higher but most of the risk metrics and we've talked about this before right most of the risk metrics suggested that that you know April was the top right the only thing that didn't suggest that was the actual price which again went just a bit higher in November and at the end of the day price action is King over over all the different metrics that we use to try to identify what price is going to do at the end of the day price action is is King right so the way you the the way that I navigate the S P 500 again is an any asset that I'm interested in is to identify a risk level that whenever it's below that risk level you ignore the news right you ignore everything and you just you you DCA below that risk level now DCA can be made more complicated or less complicated right if it's a static DCA it could be putting in the same amount of money every single month right so maybe you put in 500 a month into the S P 500 as long as it's below sorry if you hear all the noise upstairs my kids are running around but you know there's four of them so what am I going to do if if you have say um you know if you have a a scenario where you say all right well when it's below a certain risk level I want to DCA x amount right you could go with that strategy and say all right well 500 a month if it's below you know let's say the 0.6 risk level all right but on the other hand you could say well maybe if it's between 0.5 and 0.6 risk I put in x amount but if it's between 0.4 and 0.5 I put in 2x if it's between you know 0.3 and 0.4 I put in 3x and so on and so forth so the idea is that there's this idea idea of a dynamic DCA strategy right where instead of a static DCA strategy where you just put in the same amount every month with a dynamic strategy you put in more the lower the risk goes right so if the risk goes lower than you put in more now it can be difficult to navigate markets like that because it does require some type of patience you know being able to know that you have enough funds to put in more if the risk level were to go lower does require an element of discipline however during the current market conditions where interest rates are high I would argue that it's actually easier to do that today than it has been in recent history if you're a millennial like me I was born in the 90s then you are not very familiar with the risk-free rate of being you know where it is right I mean you know earning five five and a half percent on on you know a t-bill or a CD is something that we really haven't seen and so if you're a person that wants to make sure you have cash to put into the market if it goes lower you can have it in some short short term you know short-term um assets or like you know short-term CDs or something like that just to make sure you're a money market account just to get you know just to get some type of interest and you can use that interest to DCA into the market and if the risk level on the s p goes to a low enough level then at that point if you wanted to that you have the funds to be able to move up or to move in accordingly right hopefully that makes sense in fact speaking of money market funds this might be a good time to just take a brief detour over to the macroverse and look at funds going into retail money market you know or going looking at money going into the retail money market funds and you'll see that oftentimes there will there will be a surge in this amount or in terms of the the money going into these funds but it's oftentimes a recession that will turn that back around now why does it turn it back around it's not it's not just because asset prices are lower but also it's typically because the FED is cutting rates to deal with their recession so if the rates come back down then people are going to be less inclined to want to put their money in fixed income investing at least new money maybe if they lock some things in they'll keep that there but if you just have your money and say like a money market and you're earning five percent and you wake up one day and the FEDS cut rates and now and now you're earning three only earning three percent and you also see that asset prices are a lot lower and the reason they're a lot lower is because there was a recession induced by the fed and the reason why the FED might be cutting is to deal with the recession that they induced then you could see asset prices lower and if asset prices go lower what happens is you'll see this money flow out of money market funds back into theoretically risk assets for two reasons right asset prices are lower but also the risk-free rate is lower if the risk-free rate is lower then it's going to make investors want to seek yield elsewhere okay so that is a way that you know it is one particular strategy that you could take on if you wanted to sort of make sure you have some money on the sidelines there is fixed fixed income investing which does make some some more sense now than it really ever has at least in in you know the investing careers of Millennials we have this you know this option now that hasn't really previously existed and so the idea is you know just picking a risk level and saying you know what below this risk level I'll just DCA all right and if it goes low enough then I will get more aggressive now let's take a look at some of the levels that it's gone to in the past okay during the financial crisis back in 2008 and 2009 you'll see the risk went all the way down to point one that is something that doesn't happen very often and so if it happens it's it's usually prudent to take advantage of it it's like March of 2020. I mean there weren't very you know I wasn't sitting there thinking that the risk was going to go down to 0.29 right and again we did a video on it back then you know just rolled back the clock a few years it's that if it happens then you react right it's more of a rather than try to predict what's going to happen the better idea is to react to whatever does happen so if the risk level is at a certain level like you know 0.29 like it was back in March of 2020 then it's generally a good idea to start scaling in and if you haven't already I mean that's of course if you haven't already which I mean again back then it would have been very difficult to not already scaling in at that point because um it sort of just snuck up on us and the entire Market collapsed very very quickly in 2008 and 2009 had you started to DCA in I mean the market would have continued to go down for a while but again I mean you can see it had a pretty strong bounce and then look what ultimately came after it and then look at the.com crash you'll see that we we the risk came down to around 0.305 it bounced up and then came back down to 0.244 bounced up again and then ultimately found its low on the risk metric at 0.220 even though the price low uh was was maybe just a bit lower a few months later okay so but what you can see is that these risk levels of you know below 0.3 don't really happen that often you can see it happened in March of 2020 it happened back in 2009 and then it also happened back during the.com crash and you can go back in history as well go back to the 1970s when we earned in the 60s when we had periods of high inflation and you'll find periods here where the where the risk level went below 0.3 risk and so that's something to consider okay but you know you the only way you ever take advantage of of low risk levels and low asset prices is to always have some something set aside and again that's something that percentage is going to vary depending on who you are and the amount of risk you're willing to take on someone who doesn't want to take on a lot of risk might be sitting in more cash someone who does want to take in a lot of risk might not be sitting in a lot of cash and they're rewarded when markets go up but if they take on if they if they're a hundred percent deployed and you get some type of Crash like we had in March of 2020 or in the financial crisis or the.com crash and you're 100 deployed up here or up here or up here then it doesn't give you any flexibility if the market goes down right and and having some like some level of flexibility I think is useful for navigating financial markets now for me personally when the s p does get to high risk levels you could use it as a reason to to want to take some profits but oftentimes I mean the truth is is really the s p does just generally go up with time okay so it's not like you have to take it out at a high risk level maybe it means you just don't add as much right you or you or you just don't add anything because it's at a high risk level or maybe if you want to buy a house you know selling it at a 0.9 risk level is a lot better than selling at a 0.5 risk level or a 0.3 risk level so that's what I've historically said over on the premium side ride is at a high risk level for the S P 500 it doesn't mean that you have to immediately sell right because we know that the risk level can stay elevated for months but if there's a large purchase that you want to make then certainly taking profits at say 0.9 risk is much more attractive than trying to take profits or trying to sell at 0.5 risk or something like that okay so that's the general idea and again this chart is available through um through the website again link for that is in the description below into the cryptiverse.com we do of course have several different tiers available including a free one right so if you wanna if you want access to the free tier we do offer a free newsletter that goes out every single most every single Friday I believe and um and so do be aware that those options are there but again I would encourage you to to think of a strategy to navigate financial markets it doesn't even have to be this one right it could be some other type of metric that you create if you don't if you don't want to use this one I think that's fine it's all about how do you navigate financial markets with a plan okay because if you go into financial markets with the idea that you're just going to buy when when everyone tells you not to and sell when or sorry if you're going to buy when everyone tells you not to and sell when when no one wants to right if you go in like that then of course it could work out the problem is that most people they don't want to buy in a recession and they don't want to sell at the height of a bull market okay so you you really want to have a strategy to navigate it no matter what and the way that you know the way that I do it is to quantify what the risk level is and by doing that it it better allows me um the ability to to navigate financial markets and again this is the S P 500 there's various index funds that can track various sectors of the market um typically low expense ratio index funds are the way to go because they often outperform ones with larger expense ratios it's not it's not that it's not that you know managers of those funds can't outperform the market ever it's just that if and when they do oftentimes the the the fees that they're collecting aren't necessarily worth uh the the incremental gain that you would have had and it could actually lead to to a lower return than if you had just gone with something that had like a zero percent expense ratio or something like that so again I mean I I I want to spend some time here in the equity verse so that people are aware of of other strategies other markets to navigate because again at the end of the day you know we talk mostly about crypto I would like to talk about other asset classes more um but I know my audience really likes crypto but at the end of the day you know you have Bitcoin which is extremely volatile but you have things like apple that are not even that far away from a new high so some level of diversification can be a great thing for navigating financial markets that way if one asset class kicks the bucket and goes down 50 percent then ideally your entire portfolio is not down 50 because you were somewhat Diversified again thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe if you're not subscribed give the video a thumbs up and again check out

      "    hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptiverse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin but more specifically we're going to be discussing again the Bitcoin dominance as you can see my background has changed quite a bit it's because I'm of course in uh Miami at the Bitcoin conference I wanted to remind you that if you are going to the conference I will be having a a meet and greet on the 20th from 12 30 to 2 30 next to the Bitcoin inflatable so I will look to see you guys there I thought it would be prudent to talk about the dominance considering we are here at the Bitcoin conference for 2023 and one of the things we've talked about for a long time is that this is the phase of the cycle where we would generally expect the dominance of Bitcoin to push quite a bit higher we have essentially moved from around 38 percent or so up to around 49 we have fallen back a little bit down to 48 but you should notice the relative resilience of the dominance at this time it is not going back down uh to the same you know to the same levels that it used to fall back down to it's in fact holding support uh where previously found some level of resistance so I think it's important to recognize that when Bitcoin pumps up the altcoin market lags behind it and then when Bitcoin falls back down the altcoin market tends to fall even more so the general expectation in my opinion is that this will likely continue we will likely see uh continued relative strength of Bitcoin to the altcoin market and again I think this relative strength will likely last for many months to come it doesn't mean that you're not going to see occasional rallies in the altcoin market of course if Bitcoin USD holds up for any sustained period of time you will see all coins make some moves but at the end of the day the dominance of Bitcoin should continue to move Higher One of the most common forms of criticism related to the Bitcoin dominance theory is well why you talk about it if you can't trade it well that's not really true I mean there's a lot of different reasons why you talk about the Bitcoin dominance and that's because it gives you an idea if you want exposure into crypto during say the prehabbing year and even the early phase of the having year you want to make sure that you're maximizing your risk-adjusted returns and so the exposure into crypto in my opinion should be limited to to bitcoin during this phase of the market cycle mainly because we would generally expect the altcoin market to systematically bleed back to bitcoin for for quite some time and and we would also expect this to to continue well until the dominance is is quite a bit higher than 50 percent I ultimately think the dominance is going to 60 but I suppose we should wait till 50 before we uh get to too far ahead of ourselves right now the dominance is coming in at 48 and and what we're going to talk a little bit about what we talked about yesterday a very similar thing if you remember yesterday we spoke about the Bitcoin bullmark sport band and how big coin has been holding support on the 20-week SMA back in March and then that's where it sort of moved back higher we could be testing it soon for Bitcoin although today we've moved back up to 27.5 but the point is that if you look here at the Bitcoin dominance you'll notice that we've actually held support on it a couple times already right so Bitcoin USD has only come back down to a one so far but the Bitcoin dominance health support here in January of 2023 and at around 40 41 or so and then the Bitcoin dominance held support at the 20-week estimate again in March of 2023 at around 42 to 43 percent and so the relevance of this is that right now the Bitcoin dominance is at 48.15 percent and the bullmark sport band for that dominance is that fits from 45.9 percent to 45.66 percent so you're essentially looking at at the bullmark sport Bend for the dominance is is right around that 45 and a half to 46 percent level the reason why this is important is because there has been uh some element of consolidation until you get to the bull Mark squirt band and then the dominance explodes back up to the upside so we saw that back in January we saw about saw back over here in March February and March as well and then once it tagged that it then had enough strength for the for the dominance to then move higher once again and so you know there there could be some reason to believe that it's just in another long consolidation pattern before It ultimately breaks up uh I think that's one potentially appropriate way to look at it although I don't really think we need to necessarily wait for the 20-week estimate to reach these levels for us to push higher it is a potential outcome that I you know I think we should at least consider one other way to look at the dominance of course is to look at the 100-day moving average and the reason I bring this up is because you'll notice that bitcoinusd also held support on the 100-day back in March you'll see here that Bitcoin held support here on the 100-day moving average back in March and the Bitcoin dominance held support on the on the 100 day back in March as well the difference though is that the dominance also held support back in January again unlike Bitcoin USC which which you know was just trying to get above it at that time so you can see that the dominance was already showing a significant amount of strength even before the Bitcoin rally took off the Bitcoin dominance here bottom back in September and which is when we talked about there's historically a transitionary period and the dominance around the September time frame and I would go as far to say that we might see a transition to the dominance fading sum once we get to this September so let's imagine a scenario where the dominance rallies June July and August and then at some point in September it potentially fades in the short term although I do think it would so likely continue higher into the having year you could see some type of short-term uh pullback sometime around September but if you look at the 100-day moving average for the Bitcoin dominance you'll see that we held support on it around 41 percent we held support on it around 43 as well and now the 100-day moving average is actually already above 46 percent it's at around 46.31 percent and it's moving higher relatively quickly and so this could also be an area to look out for if there is any type of move in say a relative moves in the altcoin market with respect to bitcoin or anything like that if you do see the dominance come back down to this 100-day moving average whether it happens now or whether we pop up and then come back down that could also be a sign that the dominance is ready to move higher in a more sustained way as well regardless the main thing that we've talked about for quite some time and again I I remind you the reason we focus on this is because we are systematically watching the deterioration of the altcoin market on their Bitcoin pairs this has been going on for a long time I I would challenge many of you to look at a lot of your altcoins on their Bitcoin pairs most of them just continue to put in new lows as recently as the last week and and so that's the the reason why we focus on this is because we would still generally expect the altcoin market to bleed back to bitcoin for quite some time um one of the things I wanted to mention and and we've talked about this a lot as well is that the 49 level Still Remains a pretty strong level that needs to be broken okay now if we if we roll back the clock back to the last time the dominance broke out in a in a sustained way and and went much higher you'll see that it had to break out above those prior range highs the prior Range High in 20 uh in 2018 was around 51 or so we also saw a breakout in 2019 once we got above 63 percent um but the point here is that we still need to break this prior Range High until we do there's going to be you know there's going to be some Skeptics uh with regards to whether the dominance will push higher or not I think that if it breaks through I think that those you know those people would likely throw in the towel and and the dominance could then quickly move to 51 52 55 56 so on and so forth but this is of course a a pretty strong level you can see that we were not able to break it back over here in in May of 2021 we also did not break it in August we're unable to reach it even in June of 2022 and not even close in October or 2021. the main difference that we're seeing on this approach is that rather than just having a single Wick higher and getting rejected we're actually spending a lot of time up here to me this shows sustained strength in the dominance it shows that relative weakness in the altcoin market that we've been talking about and again like I'm not here to say that you know any individual altcoin can't go up at all again if Bitcoin goes up it can drag the altcoin market with it the point is that the altcoin market will likely continue to bleed on their Bitcoin pairs so I'm looking for a a push Above This 49 level but remember a few years ago when we saw this break above it occurred on a Bitcoin rally that doesn't mean that it has to occur this time the last time that Bitcoin dominance went up to around these levels it was actually when Bitcoin was dropping in June but in 2018 when we rallied above the range highs it was on a Bitcoin rally and then once we broke above that critical threshold when Bitcoin USD went back down in in the second half of the year that was when the the dominance continued to Rally right so the whole point is that the dominant should go up either way right regardless of what your conviction is on bitcoin USD we would expect the dominance to go up either way and therefore it makes it it makes it um you know more worthwhile more worth the risk in my opinion uh to not or to not be to not be in the altcoin market um over over say something like Bitcoin I also wanted to briefly mention the dominance excluding stable coins we've talked about the the reasons to care about this if you look at the dominance excluding Stables we're currently sitting at around 52.41 and you can see that we just continue to slowly push higher I would still generally expect us to take out this prior Range High over here which excludes stable coins around 55 5.3 percent in order to do that of course the Bitcoin dominance excluding Stables would need to move Higher by another three percent or so if you look at say a moving average like a 50-day SMA you can again once this once again see that the dominance is building out a relatively strong base to ultimately move much higher going back to bitcoin USD the one thing I I want to remind people of is that if Bitcoin holds and and pushes higher going back to you know even just going back up a couple thousand dollars you could easily see the dominance get back to that 49 level break it and then and then hopefully hold it and if that's the case then it would show a fundamental progression in the market cycle for those who are more interested in the altcoin market again it's only from higher levels of Bitcoin dominance that the altcoin market can really see those All Seasons that so many people want the All Seasons that a lot of people sort of crave don't typically happen when the dominance is is at 40 percent I mean you might see some level of it but it's not the same thing that many people remember from from 2021. if you remember back to 2021 it was when the dominance was basically dropping Like a Rock from over 70 percent to around 39 percent within just the span of a few months I'm putting forth this idea again that even though it's been a long time since we've been at those levels it's only a matter of time before we break back up to the upside and go to much higher levels on the Bitcoin dominance as the altcoin market systematically leads back to bitcoin and Bitcoin sucks in that liquidity my opinion it's an important component of the market cycle it will likely continue it's a healthy part of the market cycle it shows the relative strength of the Blue Chips we're also seeing similar things play out in tech stocks as well you'll notice that a lot of the mega cap tech stocks like Google and Amazon and meta and and so on and so forth have been holding up the overall index for the most part just like we could argue that the blue chips for Bitcoin are for crypto like Bitcoin uh have been have been holding up the cryptoverse obviously ethereum has been doing well uh too and and that also reminds me to potentially briefly touch here on the Bitcoin and ethereum dominance okay so if we were to look at the Bitcoin and ethereum dominance what you'll see is that we broke out Above This Range High from August of 2021 a long time ago and so I'm speculating again that the dominance of Bitcoin and ethereum will continue to move much higher and could easily go back to 80 percent again it's our I mean that might sound like a crazy number to say the Bitcoin dominance plus the ethereum dominance at 80 80 percent it's already at 68 I mean you know 12 percent if if it climbs another 12 percent event from 68 to 80 percent or so uh then then you're essentially you know at those at the higher end of the range so let's see if it plays out I know this has been a theory we've been talking about for a long time I think we are going to be knocking on the door relatively soon of 49 and if that's the case I would hope to see the Bitcoin dominance move quite a bit higher thank you guys for tuning in again if you like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up again if you are a Bitcoin Miami we are having the Meetup on on the 20th from 12 30 to 2 30 next to the the Bitcoin Inflatables thank you guys for tuning in and I will see you

       "[Document(page_content=\"hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the equity verse today we're going to talk about the S P 500 risk metric if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out into the crypto various premium at into the cryptoverse.com you can sign up and get access to charts like this one you're probably familiar with the idea of a risk metric we've talked about it with Bitcoin before especially within the context of things like the price risk the on-chain risk and the social risk you might be familiar with with this chart here but we can also use the same types of principles to to navigate equities and we've even talked about the S P 500 risk metric before in fact it was back in March of 2020 that we put out a video on on the S P 500 risk and the risk on it at the time was very low in fact back then the risk if you go and look at the local low here was at 0.29 9-3 so at 0.29 risk now the S P 500 does not typically go to risk levels that are that low okay going below the 0.3 risk level is not something that happens that frequently and so when it happens you're usually based on historical data you know it's usually best um to consider some type of of approach of gaining exposure within the asset class if history is an indication to get us not Financial advice but I do want to point out that the current risk on the s p is at 0.572 now where have we been recently if we zoom in to recent you know recent history you'll see that the lowest we've gone was back in you know September October of 2022 in recent history around that .36 risk level and back in 2021 we were all the way up at around 0.8 to 0.9 risk so pretty heated and it showed that look this Market was going to likely experience some headwinds because we don't often spend that much time at these extremely elevated risk levels right you can see that it does sometimes happen but it doesn't it's often not sustained for a very long periods of time now very long periods of time can be somewhat subjective you know does it mean a couple days or a few weeks in crypto when we're at high risk level we tend to only spend a few days there maybe a few weeks tops within the s p you can spend months at high risk levels I mean you can spend quite a quite a long period of time at those risk levels because the market can remain somewhat irrational for for long periods of time and that's why you see that's why you'll see the S P 500 risk stay at a fairly high level for a longer period of time um then you'll then you see then you will see with crypto but anyways we can see that the S P 500 risk metric it started to diverge back in August of 2021 compared to the price right so the price slowly trended just a bit higher but the s p started to really fall over here and go and go quite a bit lower now the way you navigate markets is is of course you know it's dependent on you right there's no solution that's going to fit every investor oftentimes on Twitter you will see people make fun or sort of criticize certain strategies that don't align with their own but we almost remember that we're all in different phases of our life some people are willing to take on more risk some people are willing to take on less risk and because of that I think it's it's prudent to come up with a strategy that suits you the most right so in this case what it would mean is identifying a risk level that you are comfortable dcing into the market and then identifying a risk level that you might want to DCA out of the market now when it comes to crypto I am a lot more um you know I'm a lot more aggressive with DCA out of the market at high risk levels for instance when Bitcoin went to The 0.91 Wristband back in you know back in early 2021 that was where I mostly got out of the market now I did reaccumulate some back in the Summer with the expectation that we would go higher but most of the risk metrics and we've talked about this before right most of the risk metrics suggested that that you know April was the top right the only thing that didn't suggest that was the actual price which again went just a bit higher in November and at the end of the day price action is King over over all the different metrics that we use to try to identify what price is going to do at the end of the day price action is is King right so the way you the the way that I navigate the S P 500 again is an any asset that I'm interested in is to identify a risk level that whenever it's below that risk level you ignore the news right you ignore everything and you just you you DCA below that risk level now DCA can be made more complicated or less complicated right if it's a static DCA it could be putting in the same amount of money every single month right so maybe you put in 500 a month into the S P 500 as long as it's below sorry if you hear all the noise upstairs my kids are running around but you know there's four of them so what am I going to do if if you have say um you know if you have a a scenario where you say all right well when it's below a certain risk level I want to DCA x amount right you could go with that strategy and say all right well 500 a month if it's below you know let's say the 0.6 risk level all right but on the other hand you could say well maybe if it's between 0.5 and 0.6 risk I put in x amount but if it's between 0.4 and 0.5 I put in 2x if it's between you know 0.3 and 0.4 I put in 3x and so on and so forth so the idea is that there's this idea idea of a dynamic DCA strategy right where instead of a static DCA strategy where you just put in the same amount every month with a dynamic strategy you put in more the lower the risk goes right so if the risk goes lower than you put in more now it can be difficult to navigate markets like that because it does require some type of patience you know being able to know that you have enough funds to put in more if the risk level were to go lower does require an element of discipline however during the current market conditions where interest rates are high I would argue that it's actually easier to do that today than it has been in recent history if you're a millennial like me I was born in the 90s then you are not very familiar with the risk-free rate of being you know where it is right I mean you know earning five five and a half percent on on you know a t-bill or a CD is something that we really haven't seen and so if you're a person that wants to make sure you have cash to put into the market if it goes lower you can have it in some short short term you know short-term um assets or like you know short-term CDs or something like that just to make sure you're a money market account just to get you know just to get some type of interest and you can use that interest to DCA into the market and if the risk level on the s p goes to a low enough level then at that point if you wanted to that you have the funds to be able to move up or to move in accordingly right hopefully that makes sense in fact speaking of money market funds this might be a good time to just take a brief detour over to the macroverse and look at funds going into retail money market you know or going looking at money going into the retail money market funds and you'll see that oftentimes there will there will be a surge in this amount or in terms of the the money going into these funds but it's oftentimes a recession that will turn that back around now why does it turn it back around it's not it's not just because asset prices are lower but also it's typically because the FED is cutting rates to deal with their recession so if the rates come back down then people are going to be less inclined to want to put their money in fixed income investing at least new money maybe if they lock some things in they'll keep that there but if you just have your money and say like a money market and you're earning five percent and you wake up one day and the FEDS cut rates and now and now you're earning three only earning three percent and you also see that asset prices are a lot lower and the reason they're a lot lower is because there was a recession induced by the fed and the reason why the FED might be cutting is to deal with the recession that they induced then you could see asset prices lower and if asset prices go lower what happens is you'll see this money flow out of money market funds back into theoretically risk assets for two reasons right asset prices are lower but also the risk-free rate is lower if the risk-free rate is lower then it's going to make investors want to seek yield elsewhere okay so that is a way that you know it is one particular strategy that you could take on if you wanted to sort of make sure you have some money on the sidelines there is fixed fixed income investing which does make some some more sense now than it really ever has at least in in you know the investing careers of Millennials we have this you know this option now that hasn't really previously existed and so the idea is you know just picking a risk level and saying you know what below this risk level I'll just DCA all right and if it goes low enough then I will get more aggressive now let's take a look at some of the levels that it's gone to in the past okay during the financial crisis back in 2008 and 2009 you'll see the risk went all the way down to point one that is something that doesn't happen very often and so if it happens it's it's usually prudent to take advantage of it it's like March of 2020. I mean there weren't very you know I wasn't sitting there thinking that the risk was going to go down to 0.29 right and again we did a video on it back then you know just rolled back the clock a few years it's that if it happens then you react right it's more of a rather than try to predict what's going to happen the better idea is to react to whatever does happen so if the risk level is at a certain level like you know 0.29 like it was back in March of 2020 then it's generally a good idea to start scaling in and if you haven't already I mean that's of course if you haven't already which I mean again back then it would have been very difficult to not already scaling in at that point because um it sort of just snuck up on us and the entire Market collapsed very very quickly in 2008 and 2009 had you started to DCA in I mean the market would have continued to go down for a while but again I mean you can see it had a pretty strong bounce and then look what ultimately came after it and then look at the.com crash you'll see that we we the risk came down to around 0.305 it bounced up and then came back down to 0.244 bounced up again and then ultimately found its low on the risk metric at 0.220 even though the price low uh was was maybe just a bit lower a few months later okay so but what you can see is that these risk levels of you know below 0.3 don't really happen that often you can see it happened in March of 2020 it happened back in 2009 and then it also happened back during the.com crash and you can go back in history as well go back to the 1970s when we earned in the 60s when we had periods of high inflation and you'll find periods here where the where the risk level went below 0.3 risk and so that's something to consider okay but you know you the only way you ever take advantage of of low risk levels and low asset prices is to always have some something set aside and again that's something that percentage is going to vary depending on who you are and the amount of risk you're willing to take on someone who doesn't want to take on a lot of risk might be sitting in more cash someone who does want to take in a lot of risk might not be sitting in a lot of cash and they're rewarded when markets go up but if they take on if they if they're a hundred percent deployed and you get some type of Crash like we had in March of 2020 or in the financial crisis or the.com crash and you're 100 deployed up here or up here or up here then it doesn't give you any flexibility if the market goes down right and and having some like some level of flexibility I think is useful for navigating financial markets now for me personally when the s p does get to high risk levels you could use it as a reason to to want to take some profits but oftentimes I mean the truth is is really the s p does just generally go up with time okay so it's not like you have to take it out at a high risk level maybe it means you just don't add as much right you or you or you just don't add anything because it's at a high risk level or maybe if you want to buy a house you know selling it at a 0.9 risk level is a lot better than selling at a 0.5 risk level or a 0.3 risk level so that's what I've historically said over on the premium side ride is at a high risk level for the S P 500 it doesn't mean that you have to immediately sell right because we know that the risk level can stay elevated for months but if there's a large purchase that you want to make then certainly taking profits at say 0.9 risk is much more attractive than trying to take profits or trying to sell at 0.5 risk or something like that okay so that's the general idea and again this chart is available through um through the website again link for that is in the description below into the cryptiverse.com we do of course have several different tiers available including a free one right so if you wanna if you want access to the free tier we do offer a free newsletter that goes out every single most every single Friday I believe and um and so do be aware that those options are there but again I would encourage you to to think of a strategy to navigate financial markets it doesn't even have to be this one right it could be some other type of metric that you create if you don't if you don't want to use this one I think that's fine it's all about how do you navigate financial markets with a plan okay because if you go into financial markets with the idea that you're just going to buy when when everyone tells you not to and sell when or sorry if you're going to buy when everyone tells you not to and sell when when no one wants to right if you go in like that then of course it could work out the problem is that most people they don't want to buy in a recession and they don't want to sell at the height of a bull market okay so you you really want to have a strategy to navigate it no matter what and the way that you know the way that I do it is to quantify what the risk level is and by doing that it it better allows me um the ability to to navigate financial markets and again this is the S P 500 there's various index funds that can track various sectors of the market um typically low expense ratio index funds are the way to go because they often outperform ones with larger expense ratios it's not it's not that it's not that you know managers of those funds can't outperform the market ever it's just that if and when they do oftentimes the the the fees that they're collecting aren't necessarily worth uh the the incremental gain that you would have had and it could actually lead to to a lower return than if you had just gone with something that had like a zero percent expense ratio or something like that so again I mean I I I want to spend some time here in the equity verse so that people are aware of of other strategies other markets to navigate because again at the end of the day you know we talk mostly about crypto I would like to talk about other asset classes more um but I know my audience really likes crypto but at the end of the day you know you have Bitcoin which is extremely volatile but you have things like apple that are not even that far away from a new high so some level of diversification can be a great thing for navigating financial markets that way if one asset class kicks the bucket and goes down 50 percent then ideally your entire portfolio is not down 50 because you were somewhat Diversified again thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe if you're not subscribed give the video a thumbs up and again check out

       "\"hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the equity verse today we're going to talk about the S P 500 risk metric if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out into the crypto various premium at into the cryptoverse.com you can sign up and get access to charts like this one you're probably familiar with the idea of a risk metric we've talked about it with Bitcoin before especially within the context of things like the price risk the on-chain risk and the social risk you might be familiar with with this chart here but we can also use the same types of principles to to navigate equities and we've even talked about the S P 500 risk metric before in fact it was back in March of 2020 that we put out a video on on the S P 500 risk and the risk on it at the time was very low in fact back then the risk if you go and look at the local low here was at 0.29 9-3 so at 0.29 risk now the S P 500 does not typically go to risk levels that are that low okay going below the 0.3 risk level is not something that happens that frequently and so when it happens you're usually based on historical data you know it's usually best um to consider some type of of approach of gaining exposure within the asset class if history is an indication to get us not Financial advice but I do want to point out that the current risk on the s p is at 0.572 now where have we been recently if we zoom in to recent you know recent history you'll see that the lowest we've gone was back in you know September October of 2022 in recent history around that .36 risk level and back in 2021 we were all the way up at around 0.8 to 0.9 risk so pretty heated and it showed that look this Market was going to likely experience some headwinds because we don't often spend that much time at these extremely elevated risk levels right you can see that it does sometimes happen but it doesn't it's often not sustained for a very long periods of time now very long periods of time can be somewhat subjective you know does it mean a couple days or a few weeks in crypto when we're at high risk level we tend to only spend a few days there maybe a few weeks tops within the s p you can spend months at high risk levels I mean you can spend quite a quite a long period of time at those risk levels because the market can remain somewhat irrational for for long periods of time and that's why you see that's why you'll see the S P 500 risk stay at a fairly high level for a longer period of time um then you'll then you see then you will see with crypto but anyways we can see that the S P 500 risk metric it started to diverge back in August of 2021 compared to the price right so the price slowly trended just a bit higher but the s p started to really fall over here and go and go quite a bit lower now the way you navigate markets is is of course you know it's dependent on you right there's no solution that's going to fit every investor oftentimes on Twitter you will see people make fun or sort of criticize certain strategies that don't align with their own but we almost remember that we're all in different phases of our life some people are willing to take on more risk some people are willing to take on less risk and because of that I think it's it's prudent to come up with a strategy that suits you the most right so in this case what it would mean is identifying a risk level that you are comfortable dcing into the market and then identifying a risk level that you might want to DCA out of the market now when it comes to crypto I am a lot more um you know I'm a lot more aggressive with DCA out of the market at high risk levels for instance when Bitcoin went to The 0.91 Wristband back in you know back in early 2021 that was where I mostly got out of the market now I did reaccumulate some back in the Summer with the expectation that we would go higher but most of the risk metrics and we've talked about this before right most of the risk metrics suggested that that you know April was the top right the only thing that didn't suggest that was the actual price which again went just a bit higher in November and at the end of the day price action is King over over all the different metrics that we use to try to identify what price is going to do at the end of the day price action is is King right so the way you the the way that I navigate the S P 500 again is an any asset that I'm interested in is to identify a risk level that whenever it's below that risk level you ignore the news right you ignore everything and you just you you DCA below that risk level now DCA can be made more complicated or less complicated right if it's a static DCA it could be putting in the same amount of money every single month right so maybe you put in 500 a month into the S P 500 as long as it's below sorry if you hear all the noise upstairs my kids are running around but you know there's four of them so what am I going to do if if you have say um you know if you have a a scenario where you say all right well when it's below a certain risk level I want to DCA x amount right you could go with that strategy and say all right well 500 a month if it's below you know let's say the 0.6 risk level all right but on the other hand you could say well maybe if it's between 0.5 and 0.6 risk I put in x amount but if it's between 0.4 and 0.5 I put in 2x if it's between you know 0.3 and 0.4 I put in 3x and so on and so forth so the idea is that there's this idea idea of a dynamic DCA strategy right where instead of a static DCA strategy where you just put in the same amount every month with a dynamic strategy you put in more the lower the risk goes right so if the risk goes lower than you put in more now it can be difficult to navigate markets like that because it does require some type of patience you know being able to know that you have enough funds to put in more if the risk level were to go lower does require an element of discipline however during the current market conditions where interest rates are high I would argue that it's actually easier to do that today than it has been in recent history if you're a millennial like me I was born in the 90s then you are not very familiar with the risk-free rate of being you know where it is right I mean you know earning five five and a half percent on on you know a t-bill or a CD is something that we really haven't seen and so if you're a person that wants to make sure you have cash to put into the market if it goes lower you can have it in some short short term you know short-term um assets or like you know short-term CDs or something like that just to make sure you're a money market account just to get you know just to get some type of interest and you can use that interest to DCA into the market and if the risk level on the s p goes to a low enough level then at that point if you wanted to that you have the funds to be able to move up or to move in accordingly right hopefully that makes sense in fact speaking of money market funds this might be a good time to just take a brief detour over to the macroverse and look at funds going into retail money market you know or going looking at money going into the retail money market funds and you'll see that oftentimes there will there will be a surge in this amount or in terms of the the money going into these funds but it's oftentimes a recession that will turn that back around now why does it turn it back around it's not it's not just because asset prices are lower but also it's typically because the FED is cutting rates to deal with their recession so if the rates come back down then people are going to be less inclined to want to put their money in fixed income investing at least new money maybe if they lock some things in they'll keep that there but if you just have your money and say like a money market and you're earning five percent and you wake up one day and the FEDS cut rates and now and now you're earning three only earning three percent and you also see that asset prices are a lot lower and the reason they're a lot lower is because there was a recession induced by the fed and the reason why the FED might be cutting is to deal with the recession that they induced then you could see asset prices lower and if asset prices go lower what happens is you'll see this money flow out of money market funds back into theoretically risk assets for two reasons right asset prices are lower but also the risk-free rate is lower if the risk-free rate is lower then it's going to make investors want to seek yield elsewhere okay so that is a way that you know it is one particular strategy that you could take on if you wanted to sort of make sure you have some money on the sidelines there is fixed fixed income investing which does make some some more sense now than it really ever has at least in in you know the investing careers of Millennials we have this you know this option now that hasn't really previously existed and so the idea is you know just picking a risk level and saying you know what below this risk level I'll just DCA all right and if it goes low enough then I will get more aggressive now let's take a look at some of the levels that it's gone to in the past okay during the financial crisis back in 2008 and 2009 you'll see the risk went all the way down to point one that is something that doesn't happen very often and so if it happens it's it's usually prudent to take advantage of it it's like March of 2020. I mean there weren't very you know I wasn't sitting there thinking that the risk was going to go down to 0.29 right and again we did a video on it back then you know just rolled back the clock a few years it's that if it happens then you react right it's more of a rather than try to predict what's going to happen the better idea is to react to whatever does happen so if the risk level is at a certain level like you know 0.29 like it was back in March of 2020 then it's generally a good idea to start scaling in and if you haven't already I mean that's of course if you haven't already which I mean again back then it would have been very difficult to not already scaling in at that point because um it sort of just snuck up on us and the entire Market collapsed very very quickly in 2008 and 2009 had you started to DCA in I mean the market would have continued to go down for a while but again I mean you can see it had a pretty strong bounce and then look what ultimately came after it and then look at the.com crash you'll see that we we the risk came down to around 0.305 it bounced up and then came back down to 0.244 bounced up again and then ultimately found its low on the risk metric at 0.220 even though the price low uh was was maybe just a bit lower a few months later okay so but what you can see is that these risk levels of you know below 0.3 don't really happen that often you can see it happened in March of 2020 it happened back in 2009 and then it also happened back during the.com crash and you can go back in history as well go back to the 1970s when we earned in the 60s when we had periods of high inflation and you'll find periods here where the where the risk level went below 0.3 risk and so that's something to consider okay but you know you the only way you ever take advantage of of low risk levels and low asset prices is to always have some something set aside and again that's something that percentage is going to vary depending on who you are and the amount of risk you're willing to take on someone who doesn't want to take on a lot of risk might be sitting in more cash someone who does want to take in a lot of risk might not be sitting in a lot of cash and they're rewarded when markets go up but if they take on if they if they're a hundred percent deployed and you get some type of Crash like we had in March of 2020 or in the financial crisis or the.com crash and you're 100 deployed up here or up here or up here then it doesn't give you any flexibility if the market goes down right and and having some like some level of flexibility I think is useful for navigating financial markets now for me personally when the s p does get to high risk levels you could use it as a reason to to want to take some profits but oftentimes I mean the truth is is really the s p does just generally go up with time okay so it's not like you have to take it out at a high risk level maybe it means you just don't add as much right you or you or you just don't add anything because it's at a high risk level or maybe if you want to buy a house you know selling it at a 0.9 risk level is a lot better than selling at a 0.5 risk level or a 0.3 risk level so that's what I've historically said over on the premium side ride is at a high risk level for the S P 500 it doesn't mean that you have to immediately sell right because we know that the risk level can stay elevated for months but if there's a large purchase that you want to make then certainly taking profits at say 0.9 risk is much more attractive than trying to take profits or trying to sell at 0.5 risk or something like that okay so that's the general idea and again this chart is available through um through the website again link for that is in the description below into the cryptiverse.com we do of course have several different tiers available including a free one right so if you wanna if you want access to the free tier we do offer a free newsletter that goes out every single most every single Friday I believe and um and so do be aware that those options are there but again I would encourage you to to think of a strategy to navigate financial markets it doesn't even have to be this one right it could be some other type of metric that you create if you don't if you don't want to use this one I think that's fine it's all about how do you navigate financial markets with a plan okay because if you go into financial markets with the idea that you're just going to buy when when everyone tells you not to and sell when or sorry if you're going to buy when everyone tells you not to and sell when when no one wants to right if you go in like that then of course it could work out the problem is that most people they don't want to buy in a recession and they don't want to sell at the height of a bull market okay so you you really want to have a strategy to navigate it no matter what and the way that you know the way that I do it is to quantify what the risk level is and by doing that it it better allows me um the ability to to navigate financial markets and again this is the S P 500 there's various index funds that can track various sectors of the market um typically low expense ratio index funds are the way to go because they often outperform ones with larger expense ratios it's not it's not that it's not that you know managers of those funds can't outperform the market ever it's just that if and when they do oftentimes the the the fees that they're collecting aren't necessarily worth uh the the incremental gain that you would have had and it could actually lead to to a lower return than if you had just gone with something that had like a zero percent expense ratio or something like that so again I mean I I I want to spend some time here in the equity verse so that people are aware of of other strategies other markets to navigate because again at the end of the day you know we talk mostly about crypto I would like to talk about other asset classes more um but I know my audience really likes crypto but at the end of the day you know you have Bitcoin which is extremely volatile but you have things like apple that are not even that far away from a new high so some level of diversification can be a great thing for navigating financial markets that way if one asset class kicks the bucket and goes down 50 percent then ideally your entire portfolio is not down 50 because you were somewhat Diversified again thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe if you're not subscribed give the video a thumbs up and again check out

0.5 risk or something like that okay so that's the general idea and again this chart is available through um through the website again link for that is in the description below into the cryptiverse.com we do of course have several different tiers available including a free one right so if you wanna if you want access to the free tier we do offer a free newsletter that goes out every single most every single Friday I believe and um and so do be aware that those options are there but again I would encourage you to to think of a strategy to navigate financial markets it doesn't even have to be this one right it could be some other type of metric that you create if you don't if you don't want to use this one I think that's fine it's all about how do you navigate financial markets with a plan okay because if you go into financial markets with the idea that you're just going to buy when when everyone tells you not to and sell when or sorry if you're going to buy when everyone tells you not to and sell when when no one wants to right if you go in like that then of course it could work out the problem is that most people they don't want to buy in a recession and they don't want to sell at the height of a bull market okay so you you really want to have a strategy to navigate it no matter what and the way that you know the way that I do it is to quantify what the risk level is and by doing that it it better allows me um the ability to to navigate financial markets and again this is the S P 500 there's various index funds that can track various sectors of the market um typically low expense ratio index funds are the way to go because they often outperform ones with larger expense ratios it's not it's not that it's not that you know managers of those funds can't outperform the market ever it's just that if and when they do oftentimes the the the fees that they're collecting aren't necessarily worth uh the the incremental gain that you would have had and it could actually lead to to a lower return than if you had just gone with something that had like a zero percent expense ratio or something like that so again I mean I I I want to spend some time here in the equity verse so that people are aware of of other strategies other markets to navigate because again at the end of the day you know we talk mostly about crypto I would like to talk about other asset classes more um but I know my audience really likes crypto but at the end of the day you know you have Bitcoin which is extremely volatile but you have things like apple that are not even that far away from a new high so some level of diversification can be a great thing for navigating financial markets that way if one asset class kicks the bucket and goes down 50 percent then ideally your entire portfolio is not down 50 because you were somewhat Diversified again thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe if you're not subscribed give the video a thumbs up and again check out

      "hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the equity verse today we're going to talk about the S P 500 risk metric if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out into the crypto various premium at into the cryptoverse.com you can sign up and get access to charts like this one you're probably familiar with the idea of a risk metric we've talked about it with Bitcoin before especially within the context of things like the price risk the on-chain risk and the social risk you might be familiar with with this chart here but we can also use the same types of principles to to navigate equities and we've even talked about the S P 500 risk metric before in fact it was back in March of 2020 that we put out a video on on the S P 500 risk and the risk on it at the time was very low in fact back then the risk if you go and look at the local low here was at 0.29 9-3 so at 0.29 risk now the S P 500 does not typically go to risk levels that are that low okay going below the 0.3 risk level is not something that happens that frequently and so when it happens you're usually based on historical data you know it's usually best um to consider some type of of approach of gaining exposure within the asset class if history is an indication to get us not Financial advice but I do want to point out that the current risk on the s p is at 0.572 now where have we been recently if we zoom in to recent you know recent history you'll see that the lowest we've gone was back in you know September October of 2022 in recent history around that .36 risk level and back in 2021 we were all the way up at around 0.8 to 0.9 risk so pretty heated and it showed that look this Market was going to likely experience some headwinds because we don't often spend that much time at these extremely elevated risk levels right you can see that it does sometimes happen but it doesn't it's often not sustained for a very long periods of time now very long periods of time can be somewhat subjective you know does it mean a couple days or a few weeks in crypto when we're at high risk level we tend to only spend a few days there maybe a few weeks tops within the s p you can spend months at high risk levels I mean you can spend quite a quite a long period of time at those risk levels because the market can remain somewhat irrational for for long periods of time and that's why you see that's why you'll see the S P 500 risk stay at a fairly high level for a longer period of time um then you'll then you see then you will see with crypto but anyways we can see that the S P 500 risk metric it started to diverge back in August of 2021 compared to the price right so the price slowly trended just a bit higher but the s p started to really fall over here and go and go quite a bit lower now the way you navigate markets is is of course you know it's dependent on you right there's no solution that's going to fit every investor oftentimes on Twitter you will see people make fun or sort of criticize certain strategies that don't align with their own but we almost remember that we're all in different phases of our life some people are willing to take on more risk some people are willing to take on less risk and because of that I think it's it's prudent to come up with a strategy that suits you the most right so in this case what it would mean is identifying a risk level that you are comfortable dcing into the market and then identifying a risk level that you might want to DCA out of the market now when it comes to crypto I am a lot more um you know I'm a lot more aggressive with DCA out of the market at high risk levels for instance when Bitcoin went to The 0.91 Wristband back in you know back in early 2021 that was where I mostly got out of the market now I did reaccumulate some back in the Summer with the expectation that we would go higher but most of the risk metrics and we've talked about this before right most of the risk metrics suggested that that you know April was the top right the only thing that didn't suggest that was the actual price which again went just a bit higher in November and at the end of the day price action is King over over all the different metrics that we use to try to identify what price is going to do at the end of the day price action is is King right so the way you the the way that I navigate the S P 500 again is an any asset that I'm interested in is to identify a risk level that whenever it's below that risk level you ignore the news right you ignore everything and you just you you DCA below that risk level now DCA can be made more complicated or less complicated right if it's a static DCA it could be putting in the same amount of money every single month right so maybe you put in 500 a month into the S P 500 as long as it's below sorry if you hear all the noise upstairs my kids are running around but you know there's four of them so what am I going to do if if you have say um you know if you have a a scenario where you say all right well when it's below a certain risk level I want to DCA x amount right you could go with that strategy and say all right well 500 a month if it's below you know let's say the 0.6 risk level all right but on the other hand you could say well maybe if it's between 0.5 and 0.6 risk I put in x amount but if it's between 0.4 and 0.5 I put in 2x if it's between you know 0.3 and 0.4 I put in 3x and so on and so forth so the idea is that there's this idea idea of a dynamic DCA strategy right where instead of a static DCA strategy where you just put in the same amount every month with a dynamic strategy you put in more the lower the risk goes right so if the risk goes lower than you put in more now it can be difficult to navigate markets like that because it does require some type of patience you know being able to know that you have enough funds to put in more if the risk level were to go lower does require an element of discipline however during the current market conditions where interest rates are high I would argue that it's actually easier to do that today than it has been in recent history if you're a millennial like me I was born in the 90s then you are not very familiar with the risk-free rate of being you know where it is right I mean you know earning five five and a half percent on on you know a t-bill or a CD is something that we really haven't seen and so if you're a person that wants to make sure you have cash to put into the market if it goes lower you can have it in some short short term you know short-term um assets or like you know short-term CDs or something like that just to make sure you're a money market account just to get you know just to get some type of interest and you can use that interest to DCA into the market and if the risk level on the s p goes to a low enough level then at that point if you wanted to that you have the funds to be able to move up or to move in accordingly right hopefully that makes sense in fact speaking of money market funds this might be a good time to just take a brief detour over to the macroverse and look at funds going into retail money market you know or going looking at money going into the retail money market funds and you'll see that oftentimes there will there will be a surge in this amount or in terms of the the money going into these funds but it's oftentimes a recession that will turn that back around now why does it turn it back around it's not it's not just because asset prices are lower but also it's typically because the FED is cutting rates to deal with their recession so if the rates come back down then people are going to be less inclined to want to put their money in fixed income investing at least new money maybe if they lock some things in they'll keep that there but if you just have your money and say like a money market and you're earning five percent and you wake up one day and the FEDS cut rates and now and now you're earning three only earning three percent and you also see that asset prices are a lot lower and the reason they're a lot lower is because there was a recession induced by the fed and the reason why the FED might be cutting is to deal with the recession that they induced then you could see asset prices lower and if asset prices go lower what happens is you'll see this money flow out of money market funds back into theoretically risk assets for two reasons right asset prices are lower but also the risk-free rate is lower if the risk-free rate is lower then it's going to make investors want to seek yield elsewhere okay so that is a way that you know it is one particular strategy that you could take on if you wanted to sort of make sure you have some money on the sidelines there is fixed fixed income investing which does make some some more sense now than it really ever has at least in in you know the investing careers of Millennials we have this you know this option now that hasn't really previously existed and so the idea is you know just picking a risk level and saying you know what below this risk level I'll just DCA all right and if it goes low enough then I will get more aggressive now let's take a look at some of the levels that it's gone to in the past okay during the financial crisis back in 2008 and 2009 you'll see the risk went all the way down to point one that is something that doesn't happen very often and so if it happens it's it's usually prudent to take advantage of it it's like March of 2020. I mean there weren't very you know I wasn't sitting there thinking that the risk was going to go down to 0.29 right and again we did a video on it back then you know just rolled back the clock a few years it's that if it happens then you react right it's more of a rather than try to predict what's going to happen the better idea is to react to whatever does happen so if the risk level is at a certain level like you know 0.29 like it was back in March of 2020 then it's generally a good idea to start scaling in and if you haven't already I mean that's of course if you haven't already which I mean again back then it would have been very difficult to not already scaling in at that point because um it sort of just snuck up on us and the entire Market collapsed very very quickly in 2008 and 2009 had you started to DCA in I mean the market would have continued to go down for a while but again I mean you can see it had a pretty strong bounce and then look what ultimately came after it and then look at the.com crash you'll see that we we the risk came down to around 0.305 it bounced up and then came back down to 0.244 bounced up again and then ultimately found its low on the risk metric at 0.220 even though the price low uh was was maybe just a bit lower a few months later okay so but what you can see is that these risk levels of you know below 0.3 don't really happen that often you can see it happened in March of 2020 it happened back in 2009 and then it also happened back during the.com crash and you can go back in history as well go back to the 1970s when we earned in the 60s when we had periods of high inflation and you'll find periods here where the where the risk level went below 0.3 risk and so that's something to consider okay but you know you the only way you ever take advantage of of low risk levels and low asset prices is to always have some something set aside and again that's something that percentage is going to vary depending on who you are and the amount of risk you're willing to take on someone who doesn't want to take on a lot of risk might be sitting in more cash someone who does want to take in a lot of risk might not be sitting in a lot of cash and they're rewarded when markets go up but if they take on if they if they're a hundred percent deployed and you get some type of Crash like we had in March of 2020 or in the financial crisis or the.com crash and you're 100 deployed up here or up here or up here then it doesn't give you any flexibility if the market goes down right and and having some like some level of flexibility I think is useful for navigating financial markets now for me personally when the s p does get to high risk levels you could use it as a reason to to want to take some profits but oftentimes I mean the truth is is really the s p does just generally go up with time okay so it's not like you have to take it out at a high risk level maybe it means you just don't add as much right you or you or you just don't add anything because it's at a high risk level or maybe if you want to buy a house you know selling it at a 0.9 risk level is a lot better than selling at a 0.5 risk level or a 0.3 risk level so that's what I've historically said over on the premium side ride is at a high risk level for the S P 500 it doesn't mean that you have to immediately sell right because we know that the risk level can stay elevated for months but if there's a large purchase that you want to make then certainly taking profits at say 0.9 risk is much more attractive than trying to take profits or trying to sell at

2009 had you started to DCA in I mean the market would have continued to go down for a while but again I mean you can see it had a pretty strong bounce and then look what ultimately came after it and then look at the.com crash you'll see that we we the risk came down to around 0.305 it bounced up and then came back down to 0.244 bounced up again and then ultimately found its low on the risk metric at 0.220 even though the price low uh was was maybe just a bit lower a few months later okay so but what you can see is that these risk levels of you know below 0.3 don't really happen that often you can see it happened in March of 2020 it happened back in 2009 and then it also happened back during the.com crash and you can go back in history as well go back to the 1970s when we earned in the 60s when we had periods of high inflation and you'll find periods here where the where the risk level went below 0.3 risk and so that's something to consider okay but you know you the only way you ever take advantage of of low risk levels and low asset prices is to always have some something set aside and again that's something that percentage is going to vary depending on who you are and the amount of risk you're willing to take on someone who doesn't want to take on a lot of risk might be sitting in more cash someone who does want to take in a lot of risk might not be sitting in a lot of cash and they're rewarded when markets go up but if they take on if they if they're a hundred percent deployed and you get some type of Crash like we had in March of 2020 or in the financial crisis or the.com crash and you're 100 deployed up here or up here or up here then it doesn't give you any flexibility if the market goes down right and and having some like some level of flexibility I think is useful for navigating financial markets now for me personally when the s p does get to high risk levels you could use it as a reason to to want to take some profits but oftentimes I mean the truth is is really the s p does just generally go up with time okay so it's not like you have to take it out at a high risk level maybe it means you just don't add as much right you or you or you just don't add anything because it's at a high risk level or maybe if you want to buy a house you know selling it at a 0.9 risk level is a lot better than selling at a 0.5 risk level or a 0.3 risk level so that's what I've historically said over on the premium side ride is at a high risk level for the S P 500 it doesn't mean that you have to immediately sell right because we know that the risk level can stay elevated for months but if there's a large purchase that you want to make then certainly taking profits at say 0.9 risk is much more attractive than trying to take profits or trying to sell at 0.5 risk or something like that okay so that's the general idea and again this chart is available through um through the website again link for that is in the description below into the cryptiverse.com we do of course have several different tiers available including a free one right so if you wanna if you want access to the free tier we do offer a free newsletter that goes out every single most every single Friday I believe and um and so do be aware that those options are there but again I would encourage you to to think of a strategy to navigate financial markets it doesn't even have to be this one right it could be some other type of metric that you create if you don't if you don't want to use this one I think that's fine it's all about how do you navigate financial markets with a plan okay because if you go into financial markets with the idea that you're just going to buy when when everyone tells you not to and sell when or sorry if you're going to buy when everyone tells you not to and sell when when no one wants to right if you go in like that then of course it could work out the problem is that most people they don't want to buy in a recession and they don't want to sell at the height of a bull market okay so you you really want to have a strategy to navigate it no matter what and the way that you know the way that I do it is to quantify what the risk level is and by doing that it it better allows me um the ability to to navigate financial markets and again this is the S P 500 there's various index funds that can track various sectors of the market um typically low expense ratio index funds are the way to go because they often outperform ones with larger expense ratios it's not it's not that it's not that you know managers of those funds can't outperform the market ever it's just that if and when they do oftentimes the the the fees that they're collecting aren't necessarily worth uh the the incremental gain that you would have had and it could actually lead to to a lower return than if you had just gone with something that had like a zero percent expense ratio or something like that so again I mean I I I want to spend some time here in the equity verse so that people are aware of of other strategies other markets to navigate because again at the end of the day you know we talk mostly about crypto I would like to talk about other asset classes more um but I know my audience really likes crypto but at the end of the day you know you have Bitcoin which is extremely volatile but you have things like apple that are not even that far away from a new high so some level of diversification can be a great thing for navigating financial markets that way if one asset class kicks the bucket and goes down 50 percent then ideally your entire portfolio is not down 50 because you were somewhat Diversified again thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe if you're not subscribed give the video a thumbs up and again check out into the cryptiverse premium at into the cryptiverse.com I'll see you guys next time bye\n",

      "The provided YouTube video transcript discusses the S&P 500 risk metric and how it can be used to navigate equity markets. The speaker begins by explaining the concept of a risk metric, which is a tool used to measure the level of risk in an asset or market. He notes that the S&P 500 risk metric has recently been at relatively low levels, indicating low risk in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then delves into strategies for using the S&P 500 risk metric to guide investment decisions. He suggests that when the risk metric is below a certain threshold, it may be a good time to start dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into the market, as historical data shows that the market has often rebounded from such low-risk levels. Conversely, when the risk metric is at elevated levels, it may be prudent to consider taking profits or reducing exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also discusses the concept of a \"dynamic DCA\" strategy, where the amount invested varies based on the risk level. For example, one could invest a larger amount when the risk is lower and a smaller amount when the risk is higher. This approach, the speaker argues, can help investors maintain discipline and take advantage of market conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the speaker touches on the current macroeconomic environment, noting that the rise in interest rates has made fixed-income investments, such as money market funds, more attractive. He suggests that investors could hold some of their funds in these types of low-risk assets, allowing them to deploy capital more aggressively when the S&P 500 risk metric reaches favorable levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker provides historical context, citing examples of the S&P 500 risk metric reaching extremely low levels during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dot-com crash, and the COVID-19 pandemic-induced market crash in March 2020. He emphasizes that these low-risk levels are relatively rare and that investors should be prepared to take advantage of them when they occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the transcript presents a bullish sentiment, with the speaker advocating for a disciplined, risk-aware approach to investing in the S&P 500. The main message is that by monitoring the S&P 500 risk metric and implementing a well-thought-out investment strategy, investors can potentially navigate equity markets more effectively.\n"
