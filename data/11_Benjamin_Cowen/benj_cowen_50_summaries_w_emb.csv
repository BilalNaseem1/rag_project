Hi, today we're going to talk about the S&P 500 and we're just going to be providing a General Market Outlook if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptoverse decom I wanted to just provide some thoughts about the S&P 500 it has been a little while and of course we are coming into that time of the year of pre-election years where the market does tend to cool off just a little bit uh we talked about this in the last video and now you can see that it is starting to transpire a little bit if you're unfamiliar with what I'm talking about if you look at say the year-to-date Roi of the S&P 500 in election years right if you look at the election year average you'll often see that by about day 145 to 150 the market sets a low okay now currently we are on day what 114 about 114 or so um and so we're not quite there yet but we have already seen about a 6% drop so this is very similar seasonality that we even talked about late last year if you guys remember back during the summer of the pre-election year I suggested that we could get a 5 to 10% correction in the S&P 500 thanks to General seasonality right and if you go back and you look at what happened in 2023 you can see that we did get that you know that that correction and if you overlay it with pre-election years on average right you can see that the market does tend to cool off in about Q3 of the pre-election year so we did get that 5 to 10% correction back then now while we did talk about that I said pretty quickly after Yellen issued shorter duration than the market was expecting and they essentially kicked the can down the road uh by a lot of measures that was basically bullish uh for the stock market because it was bearish for for bonds right I mean I I I think if she had issued longer duration that that correction could have theoretically continued but when she issued short iteration it was not the best outlook for for the bond market and so the bond market then fell right if you go look if you overlay the tenure onto the chart you can see that the 10year topped out right there and then the 10e came down all right so the 10year yield came down so what you'll notice is that this correction over here corresponded to the 10e breaking to the upside we're also we just saw a 6% correction right here and you'll notice that it's corresponding to the 10-year yield moving back up to the upside so as the long into the old curve goes up it puts pressure on risk assets now so far all we've really seen is a fairly modest correction right now you may notice back over here in July the very first pullback was about a 6% pullback to that bull market support band very similar pullback right here right about a 6% pullback to the 20we SMA following that though the S&P then rallied back up about 5% now from where we found this local low the S&P is already up about 2.2% so it already has rally up off that low sum a 5% rally would actually take it all the way back up to around 5200 but what you'll notice is that it essentially sort of zigzagged its way down for about three months right I mean this this really started in July and it ended in late October Right started I guess mid July so you had August September and then it bottomed out in in late October it was about a 3mon correction or so that ultimately saw the S&P drop about 11% so it actually dropped a little bit more than I think what I suggested I said about a 5 to 10% drop back then it actually dropped about 11% um and so then of course you know Yellen issuing short iteration we saw the S&P climb on all the way back up and now it is once again SED to finded a little bit of weakness but remember there's often times some seasonal weakness around that April sort of that March April ail May time frame in the S&P 500 um again here is showing this year with the average of Prior election years and on average you know we sort of set a low sometime way out over here and if you compare this year to other years might not be that interesting to compare it to 2020 because that was the the pandemic year but if you look at other years like 2016 you can see that it followed a similar script right kind of moving up and then sort of settling back down into May and June uh 2012 is almost a carbon copy of what we're seeing right now where it sort of moves up gets a pullback and then get sort of a bounce into the last couple of weeks of April it then it then went on to roll over sort of into that May and June time frame the 2012 script here actually looks very similar to what we saw in Q3 of last year right you said a low a lower low and then one final low right now look at the year-to date Roi the S&P 500 in 2012 in that in this sort of this phase of the election year you said hello and then you get that bounce in in the late April and then you have a low a lower low and then one final lower low before then picking back up for the rest of the year and so that is something that I I think we should be aware of is is this sort of repeating this same pattern where you kind of come down you get a bounce back up you know that could go as high as maybe 5200 and then you go below the bullmark sport band and then ultimately try to find whatever your low is going to be so if if it were to reach the same extent of this correction it would actually put it all the way down at around you know 4700 something like that again there's no guarantee that it goes that low but I did want to at least highlight a couple of things one of which is this trend line that you could sort of draw out and say that you know the S&P has been holding as support with the exception of this fake out right here below the trend line which also corresponded to sort of capitulating pretty far below the bull market support band um now what's really interesting about this is you can overlay uh you can overlay sort of hyg minus the vix onto this chart and one of the things you'll notice here actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to do it the other way around I'm going to I'm going to pull up that metric right so we're going to pull up hyg minus the vix and you'll see on the hyg minus the vix you can see sort of a series of higher lows that are forming right you see those higher lows that have been forming now overlay the S&P 500 onto that chart right so we're going to um let me switch this over so let me actually s switch this to a log um now I want this one to be a log this one can just be a regular scale and what I'm going to do is is we're going to um sort of look at at this trend okay so we're going to say all right well if you connect with the Dots here right this low corresponded to that low on the S&P 500 right and then this low corresponded to the next low on the S&P 500 remember the S&P was also on sort of a similar trend line where this was a fake out below the trend line but that fake out also tagged this part where hyg minus the vix tagged that trend line you can see that hyg minus the vix just tagged that trend line again but while it did it it has tagged that trend line the S&P has still not gone back to that trend line and for the S&P to go back to that trend line it would correspond you know to a 4700 4800 S&P um for it to go back to that trend line so again I mean this is just basic General seasonality it has nothing to do with underlying macroeconomic conditions or anything like that it doesn't mean that it doesn't evolve into something else but historically we do see some type of Correction in the S&P 500 around this time right I mean you can see it in 2012 um here's 2008 well 2008 again was a recession here uh you can look at at 2004 and you'll see like how how the how the S&P kind of drops gets a little bit of a a late April rally and then sort of drops into may may uh May June time frame so I would keep an eye on that especially with the hyg minus the vix sort of back down to its trend line for the fourth time at some point these trend lines can break and if you're not familiar with this metric right if we sort of Zoom this thing out you can see what this looks like kind of going back further and actually there's kind of a nice sort of trend line here at the top that it it does tend to follow which is kind of interesting um to take a look at but every so often you will find it um sort of these you you'll see it kind of moving up and then it'll it'll get a big drop down to the bottom of this range okay so that is something I I I think think that is is worthwhile to watch out for and when it does drop to the bottom of these ranges it tends to correspond to pretty eventful moves in the S&P 500 right so if you were to look at at sort of this low when it dropped to the bottom of the range back in October 2022 it corresponded to that low if you were to look at it over here there was a big drop below it that was obviously the pandemic you can also see a big drop here by hyg minus the vix where it bottomed out December 2018 very similar thing over here in February 2018 after a pretty big drop same thing in August 2015 after a pretty big drop and and so on and so forth right 2011 um you know 2010 so when this thing you know as that thing rolls over and hits the bottom of this range here that often does Mark Bottoms in the S&P 500 um so again there's no guarantee that we're heading that way now uh perhaps we just hold the trend line again right it's possible that we just simply hold the trend line one once again and we and we just continue to climb the wall of worry as we go into into the summer months and honestly there's always a good chance that could happen um it's really difficult predicting when the market could deviate from General seasonality the the two main things that I could foresee causing deviations well there's three things right there's one there's geopolitical events which I mean you know no one's going to be timing that um so I don't even try you know I don't even really try to time that stuff because it just seems imposs possible uh number two inflation reaccelerating which I could see becoming an issue but I don't really think it's going to become an issue this year um I know a lot of people are calling for it to really re accelerate and go back up much higher in a second wave I think it's possible we get a second wave but if we do I would guess it wouldn't happen until maybe next year um you know after a a Fed pivot right I I think you know as long as you're on this side of the FED pivot I would still think that it it's just a matter of time before inflation just continues to slowly go down I could be wrong about that if the neutral rate is above the current fed funds rate I don't think the neutral rate is above the current fed funds rate I think the FED funds rate is above the neutral rate and we're just sort of watching the whole process play out um so I don't really think that inflation will re accelerate uh you know back up to seven or 8% this year it could be become a risk in future years if the FED pivots too soon before they get inflation say durably back back down to 2% so the only other thing that really leaves is the labor market um so as long as the labor market remains strong and by by that I mean you know as long as it's really printing below 4% unemployment rate then the market loves to keep on climbing the wall of worry um if you see a print above that then perhaps you get you sort of revisit the bottom of this range on on the hyg minus the vix but again we're not there at the current time I would keep an eye on this trend line though and see if the S&P sort of revisits that same trend line what's interesting is you know we talk a lot about about we mostly talk about crypto on this channel um but it is interesting how a lot of these things are are are very much correlated to one another right if you look at the S&P 500 you will find a trend line where it has tagged it you know a number of times right three times on the third attempt we had a fake out below it now if you were to look at say eth right uh ethusd you will find a very similar trend line right you'll find a very similar trend line where it's been putting in higher lows and on the third tag of the trend line it was a fake out below it so some of the times I I I think a lot of people sort of get caught up in the narratives of the different outside classes but in reality they're they're actually pretty much doing the same thing right it's just that crypto is a more volatile version of the S&P 500 right so like if if if the S&P is going up then often times you will see not always but often times you will see crypto outperform but if the S&P is going down often times you'll see the S&P um or you'll see crypto underperform what's really fascinating right now though is the fact that the S&P has already bounced off of its bullmark sport band right it went to its bullmark sport band the last time it was at its bullmark sport band was in late October you know a after the long of the yeld curve went all the way up to around 5% or so the NASDAQ already went below its 20we moving average and it's actually still below it today even though the Market's up 1 and a half% but despite that Bitcoin is still fairly well above its bullmark scorpion despite the fact that both the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ have already paid it a visit and so that's kind of interesting so if you do see um you know if you do see the S&P sort of fall back in to its 20we estimate in May kind of after potentially setting a lower high late April early May if it falls back into it once again kind of like it did right over here right it got a bounce off of it and then fell back down to it if you see something like that play out then it could correspond to sort of Bitcoin uh finally going back and testing its 20we SMA um but again there's no guarantee that it even sets a lower low in May or June I'm just sort of showing that General seasonality outside of macroeconomic stuff and outside of geopolitical stuff General season ality by the S&P 500 does show that look there is often times some weakness sort of going into that may time frame and and sometimes it even goes out until until June so I would keep that kind of on the back of you know sort of keep that on the radar a little bit uh the idea of of something like that potentially happening as we get out into May so if the S&P sort of resolves into a lower high in late April early May and starts to roll over again then you're going to be faced with this trend line once again which again could correspond to around that 4700 to 4,800 level I mean it's not even that much lower than the current prices right um it would only be about 6% lower which is basically the same amount that this first drop was right over here we dropped 6% we got a rally and then we dropped another 6% and then we got a rally and then we dropped another 6% right so we basically have three 6% drops basically back to back to back one month after another um so I think the ultimate question will be though and then we'll have to sort of revisit this assuming that it plays out we'll have to revisit it in May or June is that if we do come back to the trend line does it hold as support or not right does it actually hold as support and again remember the market needs a reason to go down not up so often times like just like it was back over here we got a big bounce off of it that doesn't mean you will always get a big bounce off of it I mean after you tag the trend line enough times right event eventually it will break um it's just a matter of you know how many times does it take to to ultimately break it and by the time you do break it you might not go back to you know where it previously was um but I would watch that level out into May and June and see if that trend line gets tested and if it does get tested whether we hold it or not will probably depend on on how the labor market is doing by then um I know last year we saw a big drump in the labor market data kind of going in the summer I think the June print saw the unemployment rate it was the unemployment rate for May but it Dro it jumped from 37 or it dropped from uh 34 to like 37 or something like that in a single month um and so that would be you know if that were to come into play then then maybe it it it falls below it but I would I would keep an eye on that trend line if we if we fade back into it in in sort of that may time frame if you look at a date range on you know sort of from here to here that was about 22 weeks and then from there to here it was about 31 weeks and then since leaving this area it's already been about 25 weeks right so 31 weeks would actually put you the first week of June you know for potentially retesting um that trend line if it were to take the same amount of time as it took over here and if it took say only you know 28 weeks then it would put it in about miday which would be somewhere between sort of this this to here and then this first one to the second test so I would continue to watch the S&P 500 overlay hyg minus the vix also I think to give some type of insight into what's going on there remember every time that it is tagged that trend line on that metric so too has the S&P 500 tagged this trend line as well um it just you know sometimes it it it bounces around for a a couple of months before actually finding that trend line so I would keep an eye on that um as we get out into the sort of the May and June time frame what I find kind of interesting is that you know some of these individual stocks are are behaving very different than what they normally do for instance Apple in 2024 is actually basically you know it's basically just gone down this year you know it's it's it's actually almost about 15% down uh for the year which if you compare that to 2020 I mean by this point in 2020 Apple was actually doing better which is kind of crazy to think about um 2016 it was around this level but not for another you know several days you not out for another several days or so and if you were to look at say 2012 you can see just how well Alpo was doing back then uh 2008 obviously was a recession year 2004 2000 was another recession year and then 1996 right so I I just kind of find it interesting because some of the names are are are doing okay but then some of these like juggernauts like apple are really struggling right but if you were to go look at say meta if you look at meta I imagine it doesn't look nearly as bad right meta's been doing better this year um you can see it's actually up quite a bit you know meta's up what like 36% year to date compare that to 2016 and 2020 it's above those two years but Apple I mean apple is certainly struggling and then you could look at other stocks uh like Nvidia which has been sort of the uh the one that's been leading this whole charge for the last year and a half or so it's up about 60% um which is well above where it was in 2020 and in 2016 uh you can go look at 2012 as well and 2008 and 2004 and 2000 and basically the year that Nvidia is tracking the closest right now I guess is the year 2ou uh 2000 where basically this is where it was at this point in the year but back then Nvidia wasn't you know the Behemoth that it is today right it was a much smaller company back then in fact Cisco was sort of what you might want to compare it to but again even those were very different companies and I don't really think it's the it's not like it's the the best comparison it is a comparison but it's not necessarily like the fairest or the best comparison person but I mean you can see just how some of the individual names are are struggling like apple whereas other ones are are actually doing quite well and so that on average the S&P um does tend to outperform a lot of people that sort of stock pick because it's it can be very difficult picking sort of the few that are are outperforming if you guys remember uh about a year ago we had the Magnificent 7 right but a lot of those names have really fallen off um recently right you've seen apple fall off uh you've seen uh I mean Tesla fell off a while back um I mean it's been struggling a lot recently it's currently up to I guess post Market it's up to 153 uh so it's back up a little bit here but you can see that Tesla year to date is actually down quite a bit so some of those names um have sort of fallen off from the Magnificent 7 while seems like fewer and fewer names are actually leading the charge you know like it used to be all seven of them but then as as time has gone on some of those names have have started to really underperform um some of the other ones right so I mean meta is still doing pretty well Nvidia is still relatively elevated Google I think Google was I mean Google's yeah that one's still doing it's been doing pretty well as well was obviously tracking it at one point uh Google's still doing uh pretty okay too but you can see like apple is has really fallen off here uh and and Tesla has really fallen off here and then I guess Microsoft was maybe the other one we could we could sort of just check in on here it's it actually got a pretty big drop last week but it's right back down to that bull market support ban which is ultimately where it found support in late 2023 so I would see you know if that just is going to hold support here over the next month or two as we get out into that general seasonality of um you know of May where the market does kind of go into a lull and then it sort of builds out from there assuming there's no macroeconomic forces at play that would cause it to take a detour from General seasonality but anyways I I I guess that'll wrap it up I just wanted to provide a very brief update on the S&P 500 and of course as always I mean there's no there's no guarantee that you even go down to that trend line right now perhaps we just hold the bullmark sport band and and continue to climb back up I mean there are examples of that right like right here in October 2021 sometimes you just sort of get a pullback to the 20we Ese and then you just continue to climb on up you've seen that a number of times um where you sort of tag the 20we moving average and and then just kind of continue to climb and maybe you keep retesting it but the general direction remains up so I would also keep that in mind as a as a potential outcome too I think the biggest insight as to whether this correction is going to occur could be based on what is the long end of the yeld curve continuing to do right you know is the long end going up and if it is you know how high is it going to go up or if it's going down why is it going down right is it going down for the right reasons or is it going down for the wrong reason Seasons uh so it obviously depends on quite a lot of stuff any we'll go and wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe and I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-04-23 00:00:00,"The video provides a detailed technical analysis of the S&P 500 and its historical performance during pre-election years, highlighting the tendency for the market to experience a 5-10% correction around the Q3 timeframe. The presenter notes that the current year is following a similar pattern, with the S&P 500 already experiencing a 6% drop. The analysis also examines the relationship between the S&P 500 and the 10-year yield, suggesting that as the long-end of the yield curve rises, it puts pressure on risk assets. The presenter suggests that the S&P 500 could potentially retest a key trend line, which could correspond to a drop to around the 4,700-4,800 level. However, the presenter also acknowledges that the market may simply hold the trend line and continue to climb, depending on factors such as geopolitical events, inflation, and the labor market. The overall sentiment of the transcript is cautiously bearish, with the presenter highlighting the potential for further downside in the S&P 500, while also acknowledging the possibility of a continued market rally.",218,"[0.06750488, 0.018615723, -0.0020618439, -0.008087158, 0.022964478, -0.046447754, 0.04510498, -0.05026245, 0.016983032, -0.0026836395, -0.018371582, -0.01977539,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be providing an update to the bull market support band if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom let's go ahead and jump in so we have a new week here the 20we Ese and the 21 we EMA have continued to slowly move higher they now range from 54,000 830 up to 56180 or so um so approximately just 55 to 56k more importantly one of the shorter term moving averages that we have said will come into play over the next few months is in fact the 8-week moving average which is currently just higher than where the price of Bitcoin is right now at 67,8 39 so the 8-week moving average is actually about $1,000 higher than the price of Bitcoin at least at the time that I'm making this video by the time you're watching it uh obviously the price of Bitcoin could be different but that is where we are and this is this is precisely the moving average that we previously said that we're likely going to interact with quite a lot here over the next couple of months and we can go back and look at a lot of examples of Bitcoin interacting with the 8 week estimate after it cools off and not only can you look back at prior Market Cycles you can also just simply look at this Market cycle and see instances where Bitcoin finds itself below the 8we SMA and we find ourselves there once again now historically what we've seen we've seen basically there's two cases where Bitcoin got below the 8we SMA and then pretty quickly got back above it so if I were to point those out you can see this this case right here get below that 8we Ese and then it quickly got back above it basically the following week we also saw that same thing happen right here right gets below the 8we SMA long Wick down and then just gets right back above it the following week what's interesting is that if you look at this if you sort of break it up into three moves right so we we've talked a little bit about this before but sort of your your first wave your second one and then your third the first wave had a pretty short period below its 8we SMA the second wave though had a much longer period below its 8we SMA and it actually guided the 8we SMA actually guided Bitcoin down to the bull market support ban coincidentally at around the same time of the year so so last year we saw Bitcoin go below its 8we estimate in May we're almost in May and then it essentially guided it down to the bullmark sport band uh we had a wick down to it in late May and then we were actually getting Wicks below it in in June so in this case you have your first wave where your first Wick here below the 8we SMA was relatively short Liv just like it was over here you have a second move up and then now it's starting to fade again and so this is and again obviously in the short term bitcoin's up but again the speculation that I I I previously have outlined many many times is that this was basically what was going to happen because what what essentially should theoretically happen is that Bitcoin bounces around up here for a little while so that it chops the altcoin market up on their Bitcoin pairs right that's exactly what we've seen happen before and I do think at least based on historical seasonality um that we could see something like that once again where we just sort of you know hang around in this area for a while but during that period all Bitcoin pairs get chopped up now there's an interesting thing that I want to tie everything back together with and it's basically what happened going into June um last year and going going into June last year we essentially had this thing where Bitcoin was fading back to the 20we SMA and then it it held it as support okay and then we got another move up now I mentioned that there's a decent chance we see Bitcoin Fade Into the bull market support band into May in June right I I've said that many many times but I've also said that you know you're not just going to go down there in a straight line as you've seen with all these other periods over here it it's a very slow process to get down there right a very slow process to get down there and it can take a while right it can it can it can certainly take a while to see that actually play out but there's something that's really really interesting about this trend if we sort of Peel back the layers a little bit and it all relates back to you guessed it the dominance of Bitcoin now I want to Overlay the dominance of Bitcoin onto this chart and you will see how really when it when it first found this local top about a year ago and started to fade right you can see it started to fade Bitcoin dominance did get a pullback initially right you can see that it got a pullback but you might think well the reason Bitcoin dominance went back up was because Bitcoin went up and there may be some truth to that statement but if you look really closely and you draw a line at where Bitcoin USD got that major bounce off the 20we SMA you can see that Bitcoin dominance had already started to turn around before that right so Bitcoin dominance turned around here even as Bitcoin USD was still bleeding to its 20we SMA and even slightly below it right you see that you see how dominance had already gone up a lot and then Bitcoin USD went up and then of course Bitcoin dominance up went up with it but dominance was already going up before Bitcoin USD saw that move now the reason why that this is an important factor for Bitcoin USD is if you look at Bitcoin dominance excluding stable coins you will see in fact that every summer June and then July right and then here June June potentially June June again every time we get into the summer month at least recently during this this entire business cycle or the rate hiking cycle essentially we've seen this was slightly before it we've seen dominance go up into June okay we've seen it go up into June and I think that dominance excluding Stables is going to be going up to about 64% this summer meaning dominance including Stables should theoretically find itself out around 60% right so you can see that would be 60 4% dominance including Stables is currently at 55 that would get it to that 60% level but what you'll notice is that there were two of these Junes it tagged the trend line but then the third June it did not and I think I have an explanation for that of course it is easy to come up with explanations in hindsight it's one of the benefits of hindsight right but overlay Bitcoin USD onto this chart right look at this do you see how in the I'm trying to stall as the price loads do you see how in the first tag of this trend line it was actually after Bitcoin USD fell right so Bitcoin USD fell and as it fell dominance hit the trend line you see that pretty clearly right then over here when dominance excluding Stables hit the trend line it was while Bitcoin USD was falling you You could argue that Bitcoin dominance excluding Stables was going to hit the trend line last June as Bitcoin USD was fading but instead we got a another Bitcoin pump last minute and then it still faded for the rest of the summer but that was enough to keep the dominance excluding staes from actually tagging the upper part of that trend line right so what if you get this time you get basically the same thing that happened last year but what if there isn't that final pump in June that sort of keeps it from hitting the top of the trend line right so again it's not a sure thing I I still think Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio is is is going to be better than altcoin heavy because I think dominance is going to go up to this level but I just want to explore that idea very briefly because there does exist a scenario where that ha where that could theoretically happen and the way that that could actually work out if I were to go back over here and pull up Bitcoin USD you can compare it to this cycle of course but you can also compare it to Prior Cycles right the the 20we SME and the 8we SME and there's three main periods that I like to compare this to the first one and it's probably the one I I put the most value in because it was during a similar phase of the cycle as it pertains to monetary policy and high interest rates and quantitative tightening is 2019 and you can see that in 2019 after after Bitcoin got its first weekly close below the 8we SMA it then rallied back up slightly above it right which is you know potentially what you're seeing happen right now right we've seen a little bit of a rally here over the last week or so and as this as bitcoin's going up right now you can see that dominance of Bitcoin is actually going up with it right remember in 2021 when Bitcoin USD got this little rally right here Bitcoin dominance went down now we're starting to see Bitcoin dominance go up a little that might not be the fairest statement because we did see Bitcoin dominance get a pretty big pullback but for me it's hard to say that Bitcoin dominance is in a big pullback when now it seems like it's just trying to hold support the same range that it previously was helding resistance at for a long time that a lot of people thought was the top now it seems like it's just holding what people thought was the top four months ago it's now holding that level as support right in fact that level of support was right around or that level of resistance previously was 55% now it seems like Bitcoin dominance is trying to hold above 50 5% so you can see that there does exist a scenario where it just simply plays out like that right where Bitcoin USD is doing the same thing that it did back over here right where it gets below the 8 week it's it gets a twoe rally back above it it then chops around for a little bit and then it and then it falls okay so there's something to be said about that potential outcome again it doesn't have to play out like that I know a lot lot of people are calling for much higher Bitcoin USD prices I would encourage you to to see those other views because there's always a chance it's a left translated cycle and we get a much earlier Peak uh than a lot of people are thinking um in terms of in terms of the entire Market cycle but I do think that that is one thing to look at because there was sort of a midcycle Slowdown last cycle now this cycle that midcycle slowdown hasn't really occurred but arguably it hasn't occurred because we haven't seen seen the rate cutting part of the market cycle yet which is what we saw over here this was sort of the rate cutting part of the cycle we haven't reached that point so we can't say for sure that that won't happen you know um I I still think there's a chance that it could play out like that and so when you look at this what you should see theoretically happen is that as Bitcoin USD chops around in this range you know maybe going slightly above the 8we SMA going back below it kind of something like that the next month or so look to see Bitcoin dominance make that move to the higher levels now do you remember what we said earlier when Bitcoin dominance excluding Stables hit the top of the trend line here in June 2021 and in June 2022 it didn't in June 2023 right but I think the reason is because Bitcoin got this move rather than sort of capitulating down like the prior 2 Junes it got that move and kept the dominance from actually going back up to the top of the trend line as there then was renewed interest in the altcoin market sometimes when Bitcoin stays flat at a certain level like that above its 20we SMA and it's not continuing to push higher then there can be a shorter term rotation into altcoins now you can see that's what exactly happened but dominance has still continue to go up on a much larger scale so what if there's this scenario where Bitcoin spends the next couple of months chopping up the altcoin market up here right and then you potentially get into June and and then we are looking at this June where you got a move up but instead of another move up what if you just get a move down below the 20we SMA I still think there's this process that should theoretically play out where Bitcoin dominance tops before Bitcoin USD Falls below the 20we estimate or it could correspond to that same week right that same week that Bitcoin closes below the 20we SMA could be this the time when Bitcoin dominance theoretically tops and there's an interesting thing to look at here as to how it could theoretically relate to the macro and that's if you sort of if you assume that this is where we are we're currently in the in the rally basically back up to the 8we SMA in July of 2019 if you assume that that's essentially where we are right now and and that the the the Market's just going to slowly fade off and on put in lower highs as that bull market support band slowly catches up then um then look to see what the altcoin market does if if I'm wrong what it would mean is that all Bitcoin pairs would not go down right so I think all Bitcoin pairs are going to go down throughout this period here I I think all Bitcoin pairs will go down throughout that period if that is in fact where we are if that's not where we are and we're somewhere else in the cycle not just before rate Cuts kind of like over here then you might see all Bitcoin pairs do something different right but you know I remember back in 2019 seeing us get back below the 8we SMA rallying back up to it the following week seeing another weekly close above it the week after that and then fading down and then you know what happened is that what essentially happened is that if you take this sort of this date range here from the current week that we're theoretically in it took about 8 weeks after that or so uh to see your first weekly close below the bull market support band and the reason why that is kind of interesting is because 8 weeks from now would put us out in in June right and June is precisely the time where I've said that you could see Bitcoin dominance come back up to the top of this wedge and it could correspond to bitcoin falling below its 20we moving average in June um it could also occur before that but there's another macro reason why that could come into play right there's another macro reason why you might actually see it fall below the 20we SME in June and it actually goes back to the to the unemployment rate right so if you actually go look at the unemployment rate and we pull that up one of the things you may note is that last year there's there there's some seasonality associated with it so if you look at last year you can see there was a top by the unemployment rate a local top in February it then fell in March and April and then it got a big move up in May right now remember we get the data one month later so if this says may that means we got this data point in June right but essentially it dropped from 36 to 35 to 34 starting in February look at this this is February started at 39 though 39 to 38 instead of what we saw last time last year it was 36 to 35 now if this pattern continues to repeat which it probably won't but if it did then it would mean the unemployment rate could still potentially go down on the next data point potentially back down to 3.7 right if it were to follow this now I'm not saying that it will but if it does go to 3.7 it might give everyone the assumption that we're just sort of going back down but what if then in June which would be the May data point which is this one you see it go here last year it went from 34 to 37 in a single month so what happens if we bleed down to 37 by the next data point and then in June we get the May data point that gets it the 4% I've said many times that 4% unemployment rate is when is when the FED will start to pay attention 4% so if we hit 4% unemployment rate in May it means that that data Point's not going to come until June right so when we get the May data point it will actually be for April so then theoretically if there is some seasonality associated with this and you get a spike in the unemployment rate in May you're not going to see that reflected until till June and so the way that could potentially play out on the Bitcoin USD chart is you basically spend the next couple of months you know chopping around this range as all Bitcoin pairs drop while Bitcoin USD stays strong right again I've said that forever that what you would likely see going into the summer is for Bitcoin to sort of spend some time up in this range chopping the altcoin market up kind of like what it did over here which is basically exactly a year ago and also what it did over here in 2019 where it chopped the altcoin market up now again I know a lot of people would look at this and say well why can't it play out the same way why can't it just go back to the 20we SMA and hold it as support and then get a rally into June just like we saw last year in fact in 2019 we had a rally into June where Bitcoin put in a higher high so I don't want to sit here and say that it can't happen and I will continue to remind you that the biggest Counterpoint to all of my views would be the views that other people Express about a left translated Peak and I bring those views up not to dunk on those views but to say there's some validity to those views and you should consider that view in my opinion in your investing Journey right it's a valid view that has Merit we've seen those types of Market Cycles before where where you know you'll essentially see the market top out in the election year it happened in 2000 it happened in March of 2000 right there's an uncomfortable truth that you know the top could be rdn and it' be a left translated Peak that's one option it's not my base case but there's other cases where you have left translated Peaks where the Peaks occur in the summer of the election year that was in the 1970s you have another example in the 1940s or sorry no that was in the in the 1940s the top the local top occurred in the summer in the 1970s during High inflation we saw a local top in December of the election year so the biggest case to sort of go against my view is if there's a left translated Peak which does have evidence for it again it does and you might say well how do you how do you resolve that with your view of a potential summer lull and again guys the whole way you resolve it is to is to just have Bitcoin right I mean like you know that way if Bitcoin stays elevated or goes up you're you're hedged for that and if it goes down if Bitcoin were to go down um then it's probably going to go down less than the altcoin market right and even if it does go down you still could have a while before that even plays out right so the reason why Bitcoin dominance could theoretically top this summer is because I could Envision a scenario where the unemployment rate hits 4% this summer now you might say well if the unemployment rate hits 4% wouldn't that cause altcoins just to drop more than Bitcoin it's true that it could lead to the final capitulation of all Bitcoin pairs but the only thing the employment rate hitting 4% means is that the fed's likely going to come to the rescue and start lowering interest rates and If the Fed starts lowering interest rates then people that were basically sticking with only Bitcoin because of higher monetary or stricter monetary policy might actually Branch out to the altcoin market more now the problem with that in the short term is that while that can be a a longer term useful strategy because last cycle we actually saw all Bitcoin pairs bottom out before alt USD pairs if you look last cycle alt Bitcoin pairs bottomed out in September of 2019 right when the FED cut interest rates U or sorry right after the FED cut interest rates when they shifted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing right that's when all Bitcoin pairs bottomed right here and it was after the local top by Bitcoin USD was in but then the altcoin market bled for a few months on their USD pairs not their Bitcoin pairs but on their USD pairs after that happened and I think that's why Bitcoin dominance could theoretically top as we fall below or maybe just before we fall below the 20we moving average okay so that is kind of my base case at the moment is that Bitcoin USD chops around in this range breaks the all Bitcoin pairs down so that by the time it's June and Bitcoin dominance gets another rally on potentially a Bitcoin USD drop that is then theoretically when you could see the dominance excluding Stables go to the top of this this trend line again last year it didn't hit it but we also had another Spike by Bitcoin USD the last two times we hit the wedge it was after it was right as Bitcoin was was was dropping so I could see a scenario like that where all Bitcoin pairs bleed for the next two months they bought them out this summer and then all USD pairs go down until Bitcoin stops going down and then when Bitcoin USD starts to go back up um because the FED is cut it off and they've and they've switched back to Q then all USG pairs go up but they go up they lead because then there's that's why I mean that's why Everyone likes Al is because they tend to outperform in a bull market but I think what people messed up over the last two and a half years is that they outperform in a QE bull market but in a qtb market Bitcoin outperforms and that's why you can see that the dominance of Bitcoin has basically been going up since May of 20121 right and that was actually when the social risk actually topped out was in May of of 2021 you can look at the social risk right here and see that retail was was mostly here in May of 2021 and ever since then social risk has been putting in lower highs um so I I know W with regards to bitcoin USD I think that the the the interaction with the 8-week moving average is going to be key over the next few weeks right and again I'm not saying we can't go above it the 8we SMA is again it's about $1,000 higher than the current price it's it's you know it's around 67,800 or or so 678 679 so it's not that you can't go above it and in fact in 2021 when we got a bounce kind of coming out of of late April it went above the 8we SME and in 2019 when we got a bounce coming out of of sort of a weekly close below it it went above the 8we ese right so you have two examples where it went above the 8we ese you also have some examples where it doesn't and that it basically looks at last year right so if you look at last year during sort of the second wave we got below the 8 we we did got a we got a rally back up to it but it was ultimately rejected and then we went back down to that bull Mark sport Bend but by the time we got back down here upon the rejection by the 8we that's where Bitcoin dominance started to go up it was when it got rejected by the 8we SMA so if we were to get rejected by the 8we SMA it actually might cause all Bitcoin pairs to drop as well um because the only reason they're probably up as they're speculating that Bitcoin is going to continue to run the thing to watch and I've said this many many times look at e Bitcoin it's not going up right now right it it's continuing to drop and that's basically your Telltale sign for the altcoin market it doesn't mean that some of them aren't showing a little bit of strength in the short term on their Bitcoin pairs but look at e Bitcoin I mean it's it's not really doing that well at the current time and if it were to get a balance I still would argue that it's going to be rejected at around 053 which is where the bullmark sport bin is somewhere between 053 and 054 again no guarantee that it gets up there in the first place so again I would keep an eye on that 8we ese for Bitcoin and I I do wonder if like last year we're going to basically look at this play out right and and I wonder if people are going to then assume that you're going to get a a move into June which you could right if it's a left translative Peak you very well could but what happens if it bleeds into the summer and then instead of getting that bounce in June what happens if you get an unemployment rate print at 4% and then instead of getting a bounce up like that it then goes below the 20we estim and then Bitcoin dominance tops out which is precisely where it topped out last cycle right when Bitcoin fell below the 20 week s it topped in September as those rate Cuts were were were coming in right and so you know I would I would look to that as a potential blueprint for what could theoretically happen getting a little bit later into this year um but but again the first thing that needs to happen I think is that Bitcoin USD just has to spend a little bit of time chopping the altcoin market up because the thing is is like this is the way it works essentially is that Bitcoin will dump right and then it'll rally and then it'll dump and then it'll rally and you know the first time it dumps and rallies all Bitcoin pairs get a nice boost the second time they don't get as big as big of a drop or they don't give as big of a jump and you overlay this with eth Bitcoin right so if you overlay this with eth Bitcoin you put this onto the chart you see how while Bitcoin USD has been chopping around up here e Bitcoin just keeps on dropping right the reason is because the altcoin market can't catch a bid in the same way as Bitcoin can and a lot of people are still converting their altcoins to bitcoin right so you can very clearly see that that's what's happening is that bitcoin's chopping around at these highs just like it did over here and just like it did in 2019 and while it does that eth Bitcoin goes down down and ALT Bitcoin pairs go down now on any given week maybe an altcoin goes up on its Bitcoin pair but most altcoins were just putting in new lows on their Bitcoin pairs last week or two weeks ago so I would I would really focus on this as we get into the summer because there could be a a scenario where everyone's looking at it and thinking that it's going to bounce off the 20we SMA in June but what happens if we just go below it because the unemployment rate again it's nothing against Bitcoin it's nothing against you know crypto it's just what you know if if the macro holds up or not and so I I do wonder if if that is is kind of a narrative that a lot of people aren't necessarily looking at is is you know do you see the labor market finally show some weakness this summer which is when it started to show weakness last summer you know is basically when we got the June print but we got the June we got the May data in June right we got the May data in June and then you could see it how it would actually play out out across the entire crypto verse if you look at all Bitcoin pairs we know that they broke down one month before the First Rate cut right and I wonder if this you know if if this long Wick down where it sets a new low is similar to this long Wick down where it sets a new low and then the following month you see all Bitcoin pairs durably go below that low right so the following month would be May and then if remember last cycle when all Bitcoin pairs fell below this it was then 1 month later in July where the FED started to cut so you could get a scenario where all Bitcoin pairs Dro below the range low in May and then and then the FED potentially Cuts in June now I know what you're probably thinking you're like well the odds of a rate cut right now aren't really that high and you're right I mean they're not but I also know that that stuff can change relatively quickly so if you were to go look at interest rate probabilities the market right now is only expecting about a about a 16 and a half% chance in June of of the FED going to five and five and a quarter now I mean if you look here there's there's actually a 177% chance that they'll cut um it could be you know there's some people sort of speculating that they might be down to 5% by then so only about a 17% chance of a cut in June but I mean I think that this number would go up quite a bit if the first week of June we get an unemployment rate print at 4% then you could actually get the the the the First Rate cut in June and then maybe the second one in September and then skip November because it's an election year and then maybe the third one in in December now they have started to walk back uh interest rate cut expectations uh even the market is only thinking you're going to get two cuts for basically the next year now that the market finally believes higher for longer you're starting to see a lot of these altcoins show a ton of weakness on their Bitcoin pairs I wouldn't get too consumed by What's Happening Here in the short term on this little bounce I said before even over here we got one little final bounce uh where it got rejected below the B Mark Sport fand and then capitulated down here to the range lows I think something like that is probably going to to to happen again for alt Bitcoin pairs so the the way that you could see all Bitcoin pairs go back down is if you know either Bitcoin rallies above the 8we SMA or or if it gets rejected by it I could see either scenario breaking all Bitcoin pairs down so it should be a process again it could very well continue to go on for a number of weeks um there's actually one other interesting way here in the short term to look at this market and that's to actually look at Daily candles for Bitcoin USD and what you'll notice is that it looks like it's kind of in a parallel channel here right so if you kind of connect the dots with these um with this range right so let me just try to get this as accurate as possible um so we're going to get those highs and the lows right so you see we've connected the top to this top and then this low to these lows right so there's pretty clearly a channel that Bitcoin is starting to form right here and I think that if you look at 2019 there was also a channel that was starting to form and and it was also looked really really similar right I mean Bitcoin USD essentially started to form this channel right and then it it essentially stayed in that channel for a long time and then when it finally broke out and then it dropped back into it during the uh during the pandemic crash but you can see that channel there by Bitcoin USD that formed just before those rate Cuts arrived right you had a a top and then a lower high in quick succession right in quick Su succession you had that and then a couple months later you had another lower high or I guess it was only a month later right um You had another lower high so two pretty quick in in in quick succession and then about a month later you then had another lower high at the top of that channel so if you were to go look at it right here and look at a very similar Channel you essentially have this one and this one basically back to back right this is March this is April and remember in 2019 those first two tops were were June and July right so you had June and July and then the next one was August a lower high at the top of the channel and then if you go look over here you'll see something very similar right instead of June July and August what if it's March April and May okay so there does still even exist a scenario where Bitcoin could go north of 70k and still be in this channel right it doesn't necessarily mean anything and in fact if it were to continue this path you'll see here that the next time we have a Fed meeting is May 1st it's May 1st so the next time we have a Fed meeting is right here so if Bitcoin rallies into that meeting I mean you can kind of see that it would it would be right right there right and then what if we go into the meeting and bitcoin's rallying into the meeting and everyone's like all right well after the meeting it's going to go to the moon and then the FED just comes out and and you know squashes everyone's hopes and dreams of rate Cuts once again and then the market all Bitcoin pairs finally finally capitulate in May right which again kind of looks similar to to to what we saw back over here right where they kind of got this final bounce back up not even to the bull marks where it been got close but if that's kind of the same thing that's happening here and then they just sort of top out and then they capitulate into May and then the FED Cuts in June so you could see the FED come out in in May very you know very much meaning business like Hey we're not going to cut but don't listen to what the FED says watch what they do and I I can practically guarantee you again I was saying that the Fed was going to go to 5 a half% when we were basically back at 2% and now that the market believes that we're only going to get two cuts over the next year it's that very Act of believing that that potentially means it's not going to happen the pricing out of rate Cuts will likely cause them to get priced back in so I don't know exactly how high Bitcoin is going to go here in the short term obviously with the channel where it is um a lower high could still theoretically be just north of 70k it could be below 70k right now we're actually kind of at the midpoint of the channel um so that could offer some resistance for a little bit too um I don't really know I you know I don't really have a great ability to predict short-term moves in Bitcoin it might just get rejected here and go straight down to the 20we SMA I mean how the uh the S&P has already gone to the 20we SMA and so too has the NASDAQ the nasdaq's actually below it and the Russell is actually below it so I I don't see any reason why Bitcoin can't go there but the other reason why I'm not so optimistic about Bitcoin holding its 20we es in June and potentially seeing the final capitulation of all Bitcoin pairs in June is because normally you would expect to see the bullmark sport band get tested about every two to three months in order to hold it as support right in in 2017 as long as we were testing it every two to three months we held it as support but then once we basically went longer and we went like you know 5 months we failed to hold it as support same thing in 2019 right we we got above it in April but we didn't get back down to it until September so that was about 5 months later and then we failed to hold it as support same thing right here we got above it in October or we held it at in October and then we fell below it um in in May right so um normally when you know when you see it hold as support it's because we're testing it every you know every two to three months right but the problem here and I said I think this might come back to B us one day is we didn't actually test it in January we didn't actually test it as support and so what that means is that it's actually been about 27 weeks since we last tested it so if you compare that to these last two times that's 31 32 weeks and 20 late 2020 early 2021 and then in 2019 from from getting you know holding it as or getting above it to then when we tested it was 25 weeks later I mean these are give or take a week which I'm not getting it exact right now we're at 27 weeks right so it's already been a long time and that's why I'm not as optimistic as holding it as support and again the biggest Counterpoint to all of my stuff is to consider the left translated cycle Peak Theory right consider that theory as the biggest evidence for why my view might not be correct on this um because there are you know there there there certainly is some evidence to suggest that and there's a lot of other people that talk about that and you know I I've looked at their what they have and I can even pull up charts that show similar types of things um but I do think that the the breakdown of eth Bitcoin kind of changes the uh the calculus on this stuff right I mean eth Bitcoin has broken down and and it's not showing strength it's not showing strength which to me kind of represents that the consumer is starting to falter right DJ aren't DJing as much anym more because this thing just keeps on going down it hasn't found a low and by the way this low here was in June this low here was in June and if you connect the dots on those lows and you go to here this June that puts you at around 0375 which 0375 is basically what I've said is the target for me for E Bitcoin for the last two and a half years at least on ITC premium I don't know how many times I've said it on on the public Channel but 0375 is something I've said for for quite a long period of time and again this low was in June this low was in June and then this low was also in June we didn't actually go all the way down but remember Bitcoin also got that bounce in June um so I I I think there's a lot of different ways that you can kind of look at this market and dissect it again I do I personally think that the altcoin market is still bleeding back to bitcoin and I think capitulation of all Bitcoin pairs is likely going to occur um you know probably you know I mean I I think we're we we we're already in the process of it I just think this is sort of the final dead cap bounce of all Bitcoin pairs before they enter into their final capitulation which probably takes place in in May June and July um and they could bottom out in June but I you know sometime like May June July I I think we might actually see all Bitcoin pairs bottom out another piece of evidence for that view is that if you look at he at this part right here when all Bitcoin pairs bottomed out they actually bottomed out when social risk started to form a sort of a base in in a in a higher low right so they bottomed out in September of 2019 after the social RIS bottomed over here it bounced and it came back down it was that higher Low by social risk where Bitcoin dominant or where all Bitcoin pairs bottomed and you can see that social risk put in this low it's bounced and then now I feel like it might come back down here and form some type of a macro higher low where then theoretically all Bitcoin pairs bu them out this summer because a lot of times in the summer people don't care as much about trading cryptocurrencies and therefore if the bid disappears for altcoins then they bleed against Bitcoin and the bid's been disappearing for altcoins for a long time at least as it pertains to their Bitcoin pairs so those are my views on the market um Bitcoin is is basically doing pretty much what what it normally does after getting a close below the 8we estimate right it rallies back up to it and it tries to to test it it's doing the same exact thing that it is done every single one of these moves every single one of these moves the same exact thing so you should not be surprised and in fact remember on all these videos that we've been talking about Bitcoin dominance Bitcoin dubious speculation the bull Mark sport band it was always once you come back down here and you sweep the low then you can potentially go back up to that 8we moving average and it will be the interaction of Bitcoin USD with the 8we SMA that should theoretically cause all Bitcoin pairs to continue to drop and you can see it happening now right you can see that Bitcoin dominance is starting to slightly go back up you can even see that eth Bitcoin is continuing its slow drop down it's taking place over a very long period of time but it is still taking place it is still taking place so that's my general thoughts here on the market um and you know if if we do take out all of these highs and it's not just sort of sweeping the high kind of like what you saw over here where we we kind of went back up and swept the high if we take out that high and then hold it as support then I would say there's a ton of evidence that there would be a lot more evidence for a left translated Peak if that happens but if on the other hand it just kind of does this midcycle correction where all Bitcoin pairs bottom out this summer and then alt USD pairs finally capitulate then it might just play out like a normal cycle right and you might say well isn't it kind of late in the cycle for us to see something like that not necessarily right I mean again if you look at if you look at all Bitcoin Pairs and you take a bar pattern from from this um I don't know why I always forget where this stuff is but uh if you take a bar pattern sort of from this capitulation there to that alt season that occurred and you just sort of overlay that there right that has alt season that has these all Bitcoin pairs topping out in q1 of 2026 which is when they topped out in 2018 right and you can even see kind of how you would connect the dots you know I mean so I I I don't really think that it's too late in the cycle for something like that to happen I really don't I I think that the cycle is throwing us a curveball and making a lot of people think that it's a left translated Peak the peak occurs a lot earlier but what happens if it's just a midcycle top that causes Bitcoin to bleed you know for a while this year making people give up on on it and then and then we just pick up in 2025 as as the FED has gone back to much looser monetary policy you know there's certainly a chance that that could happen and by the way just like 2019 Bitcoin did not put in a new low but a lot of altcoins did you know I mean and you can kind of understand how that could happen because you know Bitcoin is so far above its highs that even if it were to get a big drop into these prior ranges like I mean 2019 it actually dropped to the 100 we moving average that's where it actually dropped down to as those rate Cuts arrived right it dropped to the 100 we moving average right here I mean you can even see that it rallied above the 100 we SMA about 100% here it rallied above it over 100% too right um so I mean you can certainly imagine how something like that you know just going back there if if Bitcoin can drop back to that level or even close to that level and altcoins are already barely off their lows they're only like 2x a lot of them are only 2x off their lows that's how those altcoins can put in new lows even in a situation where say Bitcoin uh doesn't um and so that's why you know when you're in these Market cycles and you're in a quantitative tightening period and a higher interest rate period it makes sense in my mind to just stay Bitcoin heavy as the Bitcoin dominance just continues to slowly grind higher right and then you know everyone keeps dreaming of all season but all season that you want doesn't really occur until sometime well after the FED is pivoted to lose some monetary policy and usually it's not right when they pivot it's when they it's usually by the last rate cut right so by the last rate cut that's when the alt season that you want probably finally arrives until then I think Bitcoin dominance is going to go up and I think it's going to go to 60% and I would I would continue to look at Bitcoin USD up in this range to interact with its 8we moving average and for it to chop the altcoin market up in this range as the bull market support band slowly comes up here to meet it potentially either in May or June and then we'll have to figure out do you get a bounce off of it like last summer or does it capitulate below it like it did over here in 2019 after eth Bitcoin broke down and after gold broke out which by the way are two things two events that have already happened the only event that hasn't really happened that you know has me again there's always a reason to hedge right the only reason that that I I'm you know continuing to sort of put out that left translated idea for those that that want to hedge is because all Bitcoin pairs technically haven't broken down yet right technically they haven't you know I think they're just in the final deadcat bounce here before they before they break down that's what I think and I think they should stay below 045 right they're at 043 now I think they'll stay I don't I think there they should stay below 045 you can see on this dead cat balance they did not make it back above that 20we moving average so as long as they stay below that and then they roll over into the summer months then it's just playing out exactly like it did over here in in 2019 again if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse outcom and I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-04-22 00:00:00,"The video discusses the technical analysis of Bitcoin's price movement, focusing on the interaction with key moving averages like the 8-week and 20-week EMAs. The speaker suggests that Bitcoin may chop around the 8-week EMA for a while, potentially causing altcoin pairs to drop, before potentially falling below the 20-week EMA in June. This could coincide with a potential spike in the unemployment rate, which the speaker believes could prompt the Fed to start cutting interest rates, potentially leading to a rotation back into altcoins.The speaker notes that historically, when Bitcoin has dumped and then rallied, the first time altcoin pairs get a boost, but the second time they don't see as big of a jump. This is because the altcoin market is struggling to catch a bid compared to Bitcoin. The speaker believes this pattern could continue, with Bitcoin chopping around the 8-week EMA while altcoin pairs on their Bitcoin pairs continue to drop.The speaker also discusses the possibility of a scenario where Bitcoin falls below the 20-week EMA in June, coinciding with a potential spike in the unemployment rate. This could prompt the Fed to start cutting interest rates, which the speaker believes could lead to a rotation back into altcoins. However, the speaker acknowledges that the odds of a rate cut in June are currently low, but notes that this could change quickly if the unemployment data weakens.Additionally, the speaker analyzes Bitcoin's price action on the daily timeframe, suggesting that it may be forming a parallel channel similar to what was seen in 2019 before the Fed's rate cuts. The speaker believes that if Bitcoin rallies into the Fed's May meeting and then gets rejected, it could lead to the final capitulation of altcoin pairs in May or June, potentially followed by the Fed cutting rates in June.The overall sentiment is cautiously bearish in the short-term, with the speaker acknowledging the possibility of a left-translated market cycle peak, but still favoring a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio over the long run. The speaker also suggests that the breakdown in the Ethereum-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair may be an indicator of the consumer starting to falter, which could further weigh on the altcoin market.",456,"[0.056121826, 0.024307251, -0.0010662079, 0.015090942, 0.02671814, -0.0395813, 0.0736084, -0.05331421, 0.01928711, 0.050201416, -0.008743286, 0.008483887, 0.04638672, -0.010612488,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin but more specifically we're going to talk about Bitcoin dominance if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel get the video a thumbs up and also check out intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom we've been on a pretty long journey here with the Bitcoin dominance metric it is something we have discussed for quite a long period of time um not even just through the current uptrend but this is something that I've discussed on my channel going back all the way to 2019 when I was actually bearish on on bitcoin dominance but over the last couple of years two and a half years or so I have been a fairly vocal Bitcoin dominance bull for reasons based around monetary policy so my arguments have just been simply that as rates go higher for longer and as quantitative tightening continues then the ultimate outcome is that the altcoin market bleeds to bitcoin it is not nor has it ever been a personal attack on any altcoin in particular it is more so just an acknowledgment of this is what we saw happen last cycle this is what we have seen happen in other business Cycles with other asset classes namely higher risk assets bleed to lower risk assets that doesn't mean the process is monotonic it does not go up in a linear fashion it is very much a stochastic process and and sort of the the the pendulum will will swing from one one side to the other but the general direction for dominance for quite a long period of time has in fact been up and since my last video on bitcoin dominance where at least the title was Bitcoin dominance we have put in a new cycle high right and that's an important Milestone to acknowledge because Bitcoin dominance has now hit 57% now the reason why that's important is because a lot of people in the cryptoverse were very convinced that the dominance of Bitcoin had already topped going into the spot ETF a lot of people were convinced that it had topped back over here in the summer of 2023 but what you'll notice is that it just continues to go higher and higher and higher and the reason why I think a lot of people got this wrong was because they were sort of basing their Bitcoin dominance view on what happened last cycle where dominance topped out in the preh having year right it topped out in September of 2019 which is why so many have come to the conclusion that that was the top there and then when it wasn't the top well then that was the top right it was because that is what would have expected to happen based on the last Market cycle but my argument has been that the timing of the Bitcoin dominance top is not just based on where you are in a typical four-year cycle right it's more so based on monetary policy and what is the Federal Reserve doing the dominance of Bitcoin did not top in September of 2019 just because it happened to be Q3 of the prehab year and you know people thinking that that has to be repeated every Q3 of the prehab year it topped more than likely there's again there's no even definitive evidence that this is true in it of itself right it's just a theory it topped after the FED started to cut rates that is when it topped not before the FED started to cut it's topped after the Federal Reserve started to cut rates and so because of that because of that I have just simply suggested that it might take until rate Cuts before we see the Bitcoin dominance top out just based on what we saw last cycle right and admittedly I might not be right about that but also I think it would be fair to say especially for you know the people that have been the most critical of My Views that it wasn't necessarily wrong to think that considering that at least at this point Bitcoin dominance just keeps on putting in new highs and now we have seen it go all the way up to 57% right you can see here this Wick right there it all the way up to 57% so really the 60% Target that I've been talking about for the last 2 and a half years while once it seemed almost unobtainable at this point it's not really that much further away now again there's no guarantee that we reach it but of course in this video I will explain why I do think it will continue to go up not necessarily in a monotonic fashion but but the stochastic process should continue where it generally resolves to the upside it was not necessarily just the FED reducing interest rates in the last cycle that caused the Bitcoin dominance to top out it might also have had to do somewhat with the fact that they started to expand their balance sheet in September of 2019 in fact if you were to draw a line through the process from where they went from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing you will notice that basically marked the top for Bitcoin dominance so my view is just simply that as we continue into quantitative tightening and high interest rates then Bitcoin dominance should continue to go up just as we're seeing it do again that doesn't mean that every week it has to go up it doesn't mean that you won't get multi-week sometimes even multi-on pullbacks in Bitcoin dominance but the general resolution of it should continue to be to the upside the further we go one question I often get asked is why talk about Bitcoin dominance so much and my answer is always the same when you go to make an investment you have to figure out well you should figure out is it worth the risk is it worth the risk and my argument has been that Bitcoin is the least risky asset in the cryptoverse and the market cap of Bitcoin dominance or yeah not the market cap and the mar the the the actual metric of Bitcoin dominance should go up right so not only is it the least risky asset but it should outperform a majority of the different cryptocurrencies right that's not to say none of the cryptocurrencies will outperform Bitcoin I have always admitted that there would be some that outperform Bitcoin and there have been some that outperformed Bitcoin but collectively we have seen the altcoin market lead back to bitcoin over the last several years and so if you go to make an investment in the cryptoverse and you want to figure out what your risk adjusted returns are you first look at Bitcoin you look at an altcoin if you can come up with a compelling reason why that altcoin should bleed to bitcoin then it would make more Sunny it would make more sense just to you know to buy Bitcoin instead of that altcoin if you come to the conclusion that the altcoin will outperform Bitcoin then it helps justify some of that risk right but the reality is that most altcoins have now continued to put in new lows against Bitcoin even this late in the market cycle so that is something that you know it wasn't necessarily going to be true based on what people thought about sort of Cycle Theory but monetary policy certainly suggested that the dominance of Bitcoin would continue to go up now I do want to talk a little bit about where we currently are because first of all I will you know just acknowledge that we've put in a new high right so you know the haters can say whatever they want to about it but it wasn't wrong it wasn't wrong to be bullish on on bitcoin dominance whatever they may want to say right this is a new high in fact if you look at monthly hiashi candles for dominance it's just been in a macro uptrend since December of 2022 right there hasn't even been a single month where these highin AI candles turned red not yet anyways so it was never wrong to be to be bullish on it I think there were some people that it didn't really sit well with them because of it the the implication of what it meant for maybe some of the altcoins they held sort of the devaluation of that altcoin but as I said before it's not personal it's just a lesson I learned in the last Market cycle and I was hoping to relay to other people as I've said I'm not going to talk about this stuff next cycle but I do hope that we can kind of you know tie a bow on this Theory relatively soon and guys I I will say you know one more disclaimer just because I've been right about it doesn't mean I will continue to be right about it right sometimes I see people you know they have a theory and they get it right and then people think all right well they were right about it therefore what they say next has to come true that's not even necessarily true okay so please also get other people's opinions and and add those opinions to you know to what you're looking at um not just mine because again you know a lot of times when something seems like it's coming true even if it eventually continues to be true it can swing back the other way for a while um because it is a market right it is a market and there's going to be people that believe different things so please be aware of that with that said Bitcoin dominance has put in a new high in fact it put in a new high this month April which is what what I said right I said going into the having we should see dominance go to a new high and we have right and we have and that has not changed and and it played out basically as as we sort of speculated it might you know I mean I know there's a lot of people thinking that it was going to top out at the spot ETF and then the that the direction would sort of gear more towards the potential spot ETF for eth but what I said back then was that well the having is going to come first so dominance should continue to Rally into the having and you can see that it put in a new high only last week now with that said it has now had a pretty substantial pullback to 55% in fact it's actually gone below 55% right i' I've watched it earlier it Wicked below 55% a few times it's gone into the 54s and I mean it certainly could go back there right there's nothing necessarily saying that it can't but I do want to explain you know again why I think it'll continue to go up and what I would be looking for to see it shift back the other way so remember first I would expect us to have to go back to looser monetary policy that doesn't necessarily mean it has to top out after rate cuts it could be you know right as rate Cuts arrive it could even be a month before rate Cuts right but the point is it should top out somewhere around that area the problem for and the problem that has been for the altcoin market is that these rate Cuts these theoretical rate Cuts just keep getting pushed further and further out right so you know the rate cuts that were once being projected to occur in March were then pushed out to May and then June and then July and now the Market's not even expecting the First Rate cut until September now I do think there's a good chance we could get a rate cut before September but that's one of the reasons why I think we've seen altcoins go to new lows on their Bitcoin Pairs and the reason why we've seen Bitcoin dominance continue to put in new highs it's because these rate cuts that people keep waiting on that a lot of the riskier assets really need to start doing well against lower risk assets they just keep getting pushed further and further out and so as the market continues to price that in all Bitcoin pairs capitulate right that doesn't mean you're not going to get days like we've had this past weekend and I actually warned about this many many times in some of the videos that I did recently and also in in a lot of tweets that I put out on on Twitter or x a lot of posts on X where I said you know if these altcoins are going to get a bounce right if you're going to see eth get a bounce it would be just after the having if it's going to happen there's no gu guarantee that it even happens and you might say well Ben you know this is a pretty big bounce guys first of all it's still right now below 0049 second of all if you look at last cycle you will notice that e Bitcoin had not one not two but three bounces off of the range low before ultimately capitulating so far we have only had two bounces one and two so is it possible that it gets one final bounce before rolling over maybe if there is a narrative to accompany that I have to imagine it would be people speculating on the potential approval of a spot ETF for eth I don't really think it's going to happen in May but I could be wrong about that I don't really have a a strong reason for why it would be approved or not I just I'm basically going on what Market probabilities are telling about its approval and they're not so optimistic right now um so if there is going to be a third and final bounce you know it would make sense for it to occur right after the having but whatever happens here I would expect it to once again resolve to a lower high what you'll notice about the third and final bounce here is that it was rejected on the weekly time frame by the bull market support ban it did get some WI above it but it still had weekly closes below right now the bull market support band for eth Bitcoin is around 0053 to 0.0054 so for me if it's going to bounce I think that's going to be your your your sort of your limited upside and I'm not even convinced that it's going to one of the reasons for that is because over here when it bounced it was not a weekly close below the range low right here we got a weekly close below the range low and you can look at another example back over here in you know in in 2016 where once we got a close below the range low we didn't get another balance after that right I mean we just basically bled until you know for for basically two more months so these are these you know there's these things that occur in the market right where you you sometimes get counter Trend rallies it doesn't mean that the overall trend has been incorrect it just means that you're not convincing everyone on the first attempt right and every time that it tests it again you convince a few more people and that's why often times what you'll see is on the fourth attempt it will break and you'll see that actually a lot right you you'll see that actually a lot in markets where you have a trend line and it'll hold it as support one time it'll hold it as support two times it'll hold it as support three times but on the fourth time that's when it finally breaks okay I don't know I want to be clear I don't know if eth is going to get a move here or not right because I mean right now it hasn't even really bounced it's still below 049 right I mean come on you know I mean 049 is the level that all all the eth Maxis told me it was never going to go below and and here we are so bouncing right back up to 0049 isn't really necessarily proof of anything but I will say if there is a bounce what you'll notice over here is that whatever that bounce occurred it occurred relatively quickly in the move right within the first week or so is when that that move topped out just after the spot ETF for Bitcoin you saw eth Bitcoin get a bounce right right after it but what happened it just bled right back down putting in lower highs so we just are about to finish up the having week so if e Bitcoin is going to bounce um this will be the time for it to do it but I'm not convinced that it has to just because we already put a close below the range low if it does bounce I have to imagine a lot of people would assume that this would be the low but my assumption based on monetary policy would be that it would be rejected here at its bull Mark sport ban just like it was back over here in May of 2019 just before before rate Cuts arrived what's funny is that this bounce here occurred at the end of April of 2019 and here we are at the end of April of 2024 which again is also theoretically a year where the FED Cuts interest rates so is that what's going to happen is it going to bounce off go back to the bullmark sport band and then go down or is this where we are where after you get some here you had two closes below the range low you get a week where e Bitcoin goes up a little but then it just keeps on bleeding right but then it just keeps on bleeding so again how do I navigate it my my portfolio has just been Bitcoin heavy for like the last two and a half years for someone like me I don't really care if these things get low or high bounces because I ultimately expect it to resolve to the downside that is my view right so far it's worked out I mean so far it has whatever people want to say I mean it has I think it will continue to resolve to the downside and this is what I would say about eth Bitcoin my base case is that it Bottoms in June okay that's my base case that's flexible though right I'm not like I'm not that set in stone on that I think it could bottom in June if it doesn't bounce here okay so if this just ends up being like a little you know a little back test of the support level that held for so long and then we just keep on going down then I think you get about you know seven more weeks and then once you're out in in in about mid June or so I could see it theoretically bottoming and then that would mean the FED would then cut potentially in July last cycle eth Bitcoin um bottomed out in August well I guess it bottomed out after the FED started to cut rates last cycle so I mean um this in fact in July is when it broke support and that was just before the FED started to cut rates so I don't know if the fed's going to cut rate I mean I don't think they're going to cut rates in May but I will say if it doesn't bounce then I would expect eth Bitcoin to bottom out in about two months if it does bounce then it might take three to four months to go to that .3 to 04 range so that's kind of my view so if no bounce potentially of botom in June maybe July if it does bounce then it could be you know July or August or something like that so just something to think about as we as we continue to navigate the cryptoverse here and and and these these moves that have occurred and you know I I do really vividly remember the bounce here off of the range Low by eth Bitcoin and everyone's saying you know that was the low um and then it just kept on You Know It ultimately resolved to the downside so again if it does bounce I would expect it to be rejected by the bullmark scoreband if it doesn't then you might just go into final capitulation into the the early summer and I think it would be honestly fantastic for it to not bounce and to just get about a TW Monon bleed to bottom out the same time it did in 202 too because if you look at this what you'll notice is that historically after eth Bitcoin breaks the range low it takes about 8 weeks for it to bottom when you see that it break the it broke the range low right here the first weekly close below the range low it took eight weeks to bottom we saw this first weekly close below the range low last week and we of course only have gone one week since then 8 weeks would actually put you in in June the reason why that interesting is because there's some type of seasonality that comes with eth in the summer that for whatever reason ethereum is allergic to the summer months right it doesn't like it does not like summertime I think one of the reasons for that is because during the summertime people go outside and touch grass maybe you should try it sometime and I think that in the summer time people focus Less on risky assets and they focus more on other things therefore higher risk assets like e will bleed to lower risk assets like Bitcoin just because there's not really you know you really need a reason for Bitcoin dominance you don't really need a reason for Bitcoin dominance to go up I mean that's just kind of what it does uh you need a reason for it to go down and and in in my opinion the way that it can continue to go down um is or the way that that that that that Bitcoin dominance can continue to go up and E Bitcoin could continue to go down is just simply people tuning out this summer and not watching crypto and when people don't watch it that's kind of when all Bitcoin pairs can bottom when people just don't really care anymore about about crypto so I think it would actually be great if there's no bounce and it just bleeds until June and it bottoms out around the same time as it did in 2022 because you can see in 2022 it bottomed out in June right it bottomed out in June if you're kind of like what's been talking about with this weakness by eth in the summer you know don't take my word for it honestly don't this is crypto after all don't trust verify you know don't just let me blow smoke and then you take it to the bank like it means something right let's go take a look let's go look at the um at the uh the monthly average Roi okay so this we're looking to look at the 90day Roi averaged out over the course of you know of of all of all of eth's history so if we do that if we pull it up for eth what you're going to see is that if you buy on average if you buy eth in January February or March then on average throughout all Market Cycles all years eth is up about 2x 90 days later but if you buy it in April you can see it's only 1.5 buying it in may only 1.2 buying it in June basically break even now clearly there are some times where the market goes down this is averaging out data going back pretty far to 2015 you know if you change this to 2018 you can see that it's not you know it isn't the numbers aren't as big right but it still gets into this lull here in the summer months right and if you take it out 2020 you can see that you know it goes down into April still kind of low in May but it doesn't really pick back up until the end of the year and you can see that for a lot of different time frames right I mean a lot of different time frames it's the beginning of the year and the end of the year that have the best Roi for eth the beginning and the end with a l kind of in between right and we're just looking at CH different calculation starts high in the the high in the beginning high in the end sort of a low in between and so when you think about e there there e some type of weakness that often comes in the summer months by by eth Bitcoin and we can actually see that if you go look at asset pairs eth Bitcoin look at the 90day ROI of eth Bitcoin on average going back through 2015 and you can see that you know the best time honestly to get into it is September you know trading your Bitcoin to eth in September has often been a pretty good time in terms of a 90-day Roi and isn't it funny how last cycle eth Bitcoin bottomed in September right what if it I mean imagine if it takes until September I mean I hope not but in the grand sche of things it's only 5 months from now you know I mean this this thing has been going on for 2 and a half years 5 months is really nothing at this point I don't really think it's going to take until September to be completely honest but there are other reasons why that have me thinking that it might take that long and I I'll show you a couple of those reasons as well um but I'm I'm hoping that it just sort of bottoms out in June if it if it gets a bounce here into into May then certainly August September time frame could be on the cards I mean it really just depends on on on when the FED shifts over to looser monetary policy right I mean I think there's a lot of people thinking that there has to be a certain answer to this question but in reality it's based on something that none of us know the answer to right so I mean it's going to be based on on things that we just simply cannot know and so while everyone wants to pretend like they have an edge and can predict exactly when it's going to bottom and some people are predicting now no one knows because no one really knows exactly what the fed's going to do um I think that they might pivot sooner than the market is thinking especially if the market continues to be weak because you know some parts of the market like the NASDAQ are starting to show some weakness but given that there is often some type of seasonal weakness kind of going into May in election years so so far this is really nothing different than normal um but if it were to continue and if if it were to evolve into something more then it would be time to to think that okay maybe they'll pivot sooner than what the market currently thinks so the reason why I just spent so much time talking about e Bitcoin is because if Bitcoin dominance is going to go to 60% I would have to imagine it's going to be on the back of eth Bitcoin dropping some more right it's hard to imagine a scenario where eth Bitcoin goes up and Bitcoin dominance um continues to go a lot higher now one thing that I I feel compelled to present to you which would potentially try to poke some holes in my theory if you look at the year-to DAT Roi of Bitcoin dominance without stable coins and you compare it to Prior having years you can see that in 2016 when the having was you know further out in the summer there was a spike by Bitcoin dominance and you can see in 2020 when the having was in May there was a spike in Bitcoin dominance right and you can see here it was in April there was a spike in Bitcoin dominance now what's interesting is that every cycle Bitcoin dominance while in 2016 it had a really big dip going into that year right 2020 the dip wasn't as big right this time the dip was basically nothing I mean it barely even went below the yearly open right so what you'll notice is that after the in in the third quarter of the year right in the third quarter of the year um so what I'm thinking is that if eth Bitcoin just capitulates over the next month or two then you could still see something like that happened where Bitcoin dominance tops out and then it it kind of comes into a lull or something over here into into Q3 um but obviously a lot of people people are going to look at this and say well you know what happens if the having is the top for dominance because you can see that there were some local highs by dominance um in those having years but one thing to point out is that even though there were highs by dominance at the prior having years did eventually go higher than where they were at the having right so in 2020 you can see that it was here by the end of the year Bitcoin dominance went higher in 2016 you can see that it was you know right around here by the end of the year Bitcoin dominance went higher so I would still be under the assumption that even if there is a pullback by the end of the year dominance you know should be a lot higher um and also considering too that these pullbacks while a lot of people expected a larger pullback by dominance going into the having year because of what we've seen historically look at this there wasn't really much of a pullback at all so maybe these pullbacks is not much of a pullback at all either If the Fed refuses to Pivot and that's why I think dominance has continued to stay a lot stronger than a lot of people thought that it would um so I would continue to look at this chart uh because I think it's going going to be really interesting to follow and if you look at other things like eth Bitcoin in having years I imagine that might tell a fairly interesting story so if you look at 2024 you can see that eth Bitcoin has already fallen about 10% in 2020 you can see that eth Bitcoin by this point in the cycle was up 40% right so there's clearly a difference clearly there's a difference here you know in 2020 it was already putting in higher highs or sorry higher lows higher lows here eth Bitcoin is still putting in lower lows which again to me suggests that the reason it's not playing out like that having year is just simply because of where monetary policy currently is that's the reason otherwise it probably would play out like the prior one but inflation is making the FED keep rates higher for longer it's nothing personal to e you know I mean I I like ethereum I really do I'm not a Bitcoin Maxi I just I've made my case for why dominance is going to go higher and you know I've certainly lost a lot of sleep over it over the years but I'd like to tell my former self you know from two years ago that you know had all the people telling me I was wrong I I wish I could just tell them you know in the having dominance is going to hit 57% ignore them right ignore them you were not wrong to be bullish on it so then the question becomes now will there be a final push to 60% one reason why 60% is a target of mine but it's honestly not the reason I initially came up with but one reason is because last cycle if you look at the Fibonacci retrace tool dominance retraced to the 618 this cycle you can see that the 618 corresponds to 60% right it corresponds to 60% so that's the reason why I think ultimately that we will get to that level um you can see that once we cross the0 five in 2019 we ultimately hit 60 or we hit the 618 um only about two months later right so if that were to repeat it would mean we hit the 618 in June which is exactly when I said maybe eth Bitcoin bottoms out right if it doesn't get a bounce now if you Deion Go full Dej on me again and bid it up once again then maybe you make me wait later in the year right which hey you're going to do what you're going to do um I'm not going to try to worry about what people think if that happens but but um that's just something to look at right here and and note that it did ultimately make it to the 618 right it it it actually you know did make it there um it took a long time to get there but it made it there you can see that it also swept the 618 again at the end of the having year right on bitcoin's parabolic rally now there's an interesting Trend here that you may not be aware of but it is actually quite fascinating when you kind of hone in on it and and look at it very very closely because Bitcoin dominance has this thing that it does where it puts in lower highs for a while making people think that it's just going to go down and then when people least expect it it just blasts through right it that's what it does you know and and that's why there's so much hate for being bullish on bitcoin dominance because it often will do things like that where it it it it it sort of luls people into to a false sense of security to make them think that their altcoin is durably outperforming Bitcoin when in reality Bitcoin is slowly sucking the liquidity out and then when no one's paying attention anymore when the social risk is basically zero it takes off again and you can can see that it did it here right it also did it over here when we were in a parabolic rally during low interest rates and quantitative easing but that's what it does right it it it it breaks out when people least expect it and then it just goes on these manic rallies now what you will notice is not to look at the lower Highs but simply look at the highs and draw a trend line what do you notice here put in a high sweep the high go back down to the bull market support band hold it as support and then blast on through right now look what happened the next time that happened put in a high sweep the high go back to the bullmark SP ban and whoops all season right that's the All Season you guys want that you guys keep telling me for the last two and a half years I was missing out on but I don't see it on the chart I mean again my eyes are bad my you know my vision is not that great I have contacts but this is not all season you know and this is what I've learned in Prior Cycles is that all season only occur for about 6 to 12 months and then we all spend the next 3 years dreaming of it and by the last time the person by the last person that capitulates their alts to bitcoin that's finally when alt season begins once everyone's convinced that Bitcoin is the way now I do think Bitcoin is the way to be successful in the crypto but even though that's true I respect the the shifts in Trends and while Bitcoin dominance honestly spends about three years of the market cycle going up with people and complete disbelief the entire way it only spends about one year of the market cycle going down and then we dream about that for the next three years so rather than dream about that for three years just enjoy the dominance rally Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio wait till lose to monetary policy and then altcoins start to durably outperform bitcoin but what do you notice in both cases Bitcoin dominance swept the high in both cases and in one case we went back to the bull market support band held it as support and in the other case we went back to it and we didn't hold it as support when we didn't hold it as support alt season happened when we did hold it as support the altcoin Reckoning continued now what's going on today well you'll see here that we put in a high in December we then swept that high more or less right here in March now technically speaking where we went in March was not a higher high so I don't know if you can call it even sweeping the high or not if you exclude stable coins it most certainly was is not sweeping the high but we're going to look at it both ways if you assume that the March move here by dominance was the sweep of the high similar to this one then what you'll notice just after it is it came back down to the bull market support band held it as support and is now breaking out again if that is the case then that means we are here and that means the dominance is going to turn around really quickly and start to go back up because it's had a pretty big pullback right it's dropped from 57% to 55% so if we are there then it means we're already on the third attempt and this could be the move that is about to happen over the next two months that takes Bitcoin dominance to 60% that is what I would hope because I kind of want to be done with with these discussions if I'm being honest I don't like being the bad guy you know I don't but that I think is where we could potentially be now with that said there is some evidence to suggest that the March move was not a sweep of the high and that would be to look at the Bitcoin dominance excluding stable coins now if you look at it excluding stable coins what you'll notice is that we put in a high in October and then we came back up to that high in December but it was not a higher high it was not truly a sweep of the high this is truly a sweep of the high is it not right no doubt about it excluding stable coins Bitcoin dominance put on a new high I cannot tell you guys how many people have been telling me about ex you know dominance excluding stable coins about how it was going down and I kept telling them I'm like no it's probably going to do exactly what it did last cycle so on the ITC website we have the way to to track it excluding stables and look at this here you can see the same thing happened right lower highs and then at one point it finally swept the high and then it had a one month pullback and then it and then it continued its Journey you see that lower highs lower highs lower highs sweep the high just as everyone thinks that Bitcoin dominance is already topped think about how many people told you dominance had already topped in January right sweep the high and then it came back down for one month and then it went on and then it went on its way to put into the top so if you look at that same pattern today you can see something similar right lower high lower high lower high lower high sweep the high we're now in that pullback right so this pullback right here is potentially the one that we are currently in but this is a more volatile version of this right the range on this just to give you an idea right it went from 57 all the way down to 50 so about a 7% difference this one here has been about 58.6 down to 53.8 right it's only about a 5% difference so this one over here was more volatile than this one was this pullback pulled back to the third top right so you had this first top second top the third top which was higher than the second top it pulled back to that level if you look at where we currently are this is the first second third the third top is right around where the dominance currently is excluding stable right so what if we're just in this pullback right here now if we are in that pullback it it still means that it could take a little bit longer for the dominance train to continue but if that's the case I still think it's only going to be a few weeks one of the things that could cause you know if again if if people are going to speculate about a spot e ETF and it gives eth some legs for a little while I I think it's only going to last cple a few weeks honestly because I I think there's a good chance it just gets rejected in May and maybe that's when eth Bitcoin finally takes the plunge 003 to 04 but you can clearly see this same Trend occurred now what do you also notice the same Trend here on dominance excluding Stables also occurred up here right high and lower highs and then eventually we swept the high right I mean it's the same exact thing thing but the difference when we swept the high here we just capitulated back down to the lows in alt season so I think we are more over here than we are here the reason I think that as I stated earlier is because when you look at dominance of Bitcoin I think it's based and works around monetary policy and we know that last cycle dominance did not top until the FED pivoted until we went from high rates to lower rates and from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing that's when it topped last cycle precisely in fact precisely so because of that because this has not changed and I don't think it's about to change I think it's going to be sometime later maybe later this year but it hasn't changed yet because of that I think that the the dominance of Bitcoin will hold support above its bull market support band now the bull market support band right now is actually kind of low it's all the way down at around a little above 53% so I mean I don't think it has to go that low honestly as I showed excluding Stables it might just hold here but if if the Deens just can't help themselves and E Bitcoin bounces one last time to the bull market sport band it is possible for dominance to fall back in to its 20we SMA one final time before going on into the final move to 60% my base case is that we don't need that that's my base case is that we don't need to see that happen I don't think we need to go back down there and the reason why I'll say that is because what a lot of times I'll see happen for for people that are very convinced of a trend is that they'll miss out on the trend because they're constantly trying to trade counter Trend r rallies right they'll constantly try to trade it so you know they'll be bullish on something or bearish on something but because they're constantly second guessing themselves they'll try to catch every single move right so that means converting their Bitcoin to alt every single time you get these moves and if you do that you miss out on the larger move up so for me my base case is not to try to predict every counter Trend rally because I don't do that every time we do get a counter Trend rally I get a lot of hate that I have to deal with because the trolls come out and they're like oh how's Bitcoin dominance doing today but I'm not in the business of trying to predict these counter Trend rallies I just want to know is it going to continue going higher or not over a more medium time frame you know like a couple of months time frame and if I think it is I don't really care about what it does in the short term I don't right I really don't so that I think is where we are right that I think is where we are looking at dominance excluding stable coins I think we're going to get one final push to the 618 at 60% at 60% now if you look at all Bitcoin pairs you will notice that last cycle they bottomed when the fed pivoted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing precisely at that at that point now we've seen a little bit of a bounce by all Bitcoin pairs I'm sure there are some comments on YouTube and on Twitter asking me about about this because again they haven't broken down yet and that's something that I'm I mean yes they haven't you're right they haven't broken down yet but that doesn't mean that they won't in fact last cycle just before the breakdown they did get one final push to near the bull market support ban they didn't even quite make it there and then they capitulate it the bull market support ban right now for all Bitcoin pairs is at 045 to 046 and we're already at 043 and we were earlier today we were at 044 and remember last cycle we didn't even make it there so what if that's where all Bitcoin pairs are the final bounce before the capitulation all Bitcoin pairs over the Long Haul are oscillators at best on an individual scale all Bitcoin pairs collectively bleed over the macro scale that's how pessimistic with pessimistic person we look at it they bleed and I'll show you why parallel Channel connect the dots those are lower highs don't take it up with me that's just what the chart shows right I don't control it if you have a problem with it do something about your altcoin it's bleeding to bitcoin right over the macro scale we have seen all Bitcoin pairs put in lower highs and lower lows glass half empty approach okay glass half full approach all Bitcoin pairs are oscillators that top out at approximately parity with Bitcoin where the alt Bitcoin pairs are equal where the altcoin market cap is equal to the Bitcoin market cap and around 0.99 or one right and they bought them out at 1/4 the market cap of Bitcoin 0.25 and that this move to 1.35 and this move to to 0.18 are just deviations that we shouldn't put a lot of weight in so for me if all Bitcoin pairs come back to 0.25 that's good enough for me I I don't if if it's in a macro downtrend and it's lower highs and lower lows then so be it you know maybe they bleed a little bit longer but guess what I will have preserved the Satoshi valuation of my portfolio for three years by being Bitcoin heavy as opposed to being altcoin heavy so this is the final move that I think needs to occur the 42% drop by Bitcoin pairs to the range lows which I think will happen going into the summer months that is my base case that doesn't mean you can't bounce around a little bit first but that is my base case 0.25 that's where I think we're going dominance excluding Stables you see this wedge that we just we just broke well we just broke through the the Range High here but do you see this wedge that we're in the top of the range is 64% if you assume we're at 59% now we're just below 59% excluding Stables that's a 5% move 5% right from 59 to 64 a commencer move by Bitcoin dominance including Stables 5% 55 to 60 55% to 60% a lot of these altcoins are already capitulating right Ada a Bitcoin has finally taken out the lows you know again it's not personal you know and I said for a long time that I did not think this trend line would hold I said it for a long time because you don't assume that an altcoin gains value on bitcoin from one cycle to another on average some of them will for two Market Cycles but there's not usually one that does it for three not usually there might be a few exceptions to the rule you assume base case for like 99.9% of alt coins that they are oscillators at best at best which means that a to bitcoin still theoretically needs to go to the range lows right and you can see that at the highs it's lower highs again it's not personal it's just this is what it does now do you remember earlier when I said that I don't think it's going to take until September for Bitcoin dominance to hit 60% or to top out but it is possible I want to show you one reason why again it's not my base case um and there could be a case where Bitcoin dominance goes to 60% this summer and then I flip my view on it and then it just keeps on going up you know that's possible too um but look at adaa Bitcoin do you see this trend line here point A to point B and you see where Ada to bitcoin finally bottomed all the way down here now look at this cycle same thing you see that trend line very similar trend line exhibit a very similar levels too slightly lower but it makes sense that it's slightly lower because alt coins are oscillators at best so you can see here that if you continue this trend line if Ada Bitcoin bottoms on the Final Touch of this trend line down here that doesn't happen until September right that doesn't happen until September so if that's the case then it could mean you still have a few more months of this chopping out right if it took this long to get here if it took a lot longer to get to this point maybe it takes a little bit longer to get to this point and so that is one reason it could take until September but again there does exist a scenario where it takes until September but Bitcoin dominance hit 60% before September because maybe the Bitcoin dominance tops out at 64% or 62% right maybe it goes higher than what I think or maybe it just goes to 60% in September one reason why I wouldn't put a lot of faith in a trend line like this is because there does exist a scenario where we just break the trend line to the downside and if that happens that could actually cause the capitulation that the market needs to finally find a bot one reason I wouldn't put a lot of faith in these is if you look at some other other if you look at some other altcoins you could try to draw a similar trend line right from here to here to here and you can see that eventually it just broke to the downside right that's a further period back that's all the way back in 2021 so if you just want to take it from here to here you can see that if you were to connect this dot to that one right if you were to connect that one sorry I'm trying to trying to connect these dots but let me get it let me try to get it as accurate as possible right so if you connect these dots there right you can see that you do sometimes go below that trend line right we just went below it again I don't know if Dots are Relic but what I would look for is to see if it can bottom out against Bitcoin it hasn't done that yet it doesn't mean that it won't but it hasn't done it yet it is it possible that this is the low yeah it's possible but even if it is the low you would still need to see it hold that low on at least one more attempt right so that's why you know when looking at something like Ada a Bitcoin I don't think you should necessarily put a ton of trust into such a trend line because there does exist a scenario where it goes below the trend line before September just like dot Bitcoin went below the trend line and it's been going below the trend line and it keeps on trying to hold it and you know I think people keep on thinking it's capitulated and then that's the bottom right and then it gets a pretty big bounce and then it just bleeds on back down and I think people are getting tired because they're like well why does it keep on bleeding back down you know alts didn't bleed this long last cycle or at least most of them didn't that were not relics why is it bleeding well one of two reasons option one reason one it's a relic option two we just haven't seen a shift in monetary policy so all coins haven't had the chance to bought them so again for every altcoin it's not personal like I don't I mean there's all these altcoins that could theoretically go back up and do great things in the future right they haven't had a chance to bottom out against Bitcoin most of them because we just haven't seen a shift in monetary policy so if you have an altcoin and you're like you're wondering what to do what I would say is we haven't even reached the point where they've been given the chance to bottom because monetary policy hasn't shifted Litecoin Bitcoin just put in a new low last week you know last week link Bitcoin I sort of Drew this out a while ago um we'll see I mean that you can see the low from June of 2023 see if it holds that low maybe in May maybe in May madic Bitcoin is in out right capitulation now I think madic Bitcoin might bottom out 1 month before eth Bitcoin so if you see madic form a low and then bounce off of that low the same time that eth Bitcoin puts in a new low that probably means that madic Bitcoin has bottomed I have said for a long time on ITC premium that the spot to start looking for a low on madic Bitcoin is at less than a th000 stats well guess what we just went below 1,000 stats we just went to 953 I don't know if that's the low I could see it going a bit lower we've seen a lot of times after Bitcoin pairs break they dropped 50% right and right now it's dropped 45 if you look at adaa Bitcoin last cycle when it dropped below the range low it dropped about 50% right from here here this drop a 52% drop so if madic were to drop 52% from the breakdown point it would put it at around 800 SATs so that has kind of been my base case for madic 800 SATs it's already coming pretty close right again I'm not asking you to time the market perfectly I'm just saying that it could continue to go down a little bit more if is going to play out like some of the other altcoins did last cycle now you probably heard me say that I think it'll bottom out before E I think it very well could look at adaa Bitcoin last cycle when did it bottom it did not bottom in September when eth did it bottomed in August but it also broke before eth look at this Ada Bitcoin broke support in June eth Bitcoin didn't break until July adaa Bitcoin bottomed in August e Bitcoin bottomed September now look at madic look at madic madic Bitcoin dropped below the range low weekly close I don't care about Wicks no one's getting out of bed for a wick weekly close in March e Bitcoin below the weekly close in April I think e Bitcoin might bottom out in June therefore keep an eye on madic bitcoin to maybe botom out in in in in May now again if the Deion are going to go full Deen on me again then maybe just shift that timeline out a month or two but the process is still there you know it's still there avax Bitcoin this is what I said guys you know that's what I this is exactly what I said that this is what happens you know and I drew the comparisons I drew the comparisons you know I said look Dash Bitcoin very very similar pattern in in in in uh last cycle did the same thing you know it set a low in the bull market and then Revisited that low here in December 2019 when social risk bottomed when did social risk bottom October over here social risk bottomed well the lower the the higher low right December 2019 you can see clearly avac Bitcoin got a rally been bleeding ever since ever since the year began you know Dash Bitcoin look same thing I mean look at avac Bitcoin pump up slow bleed Dash Bitcoin re see you can see ax Bitcoin St right this low here was set in the bull market retest that low here bounce off of it just like like Dash Bitcoin did come back down to the bull market support band get a bounce off of it actually it went below it then bounce avac Bitcoin go below it then bounce Dash Bitcoin bleed avax Bitcoin it's bleeding no does that mean that AAC has to follow the the path of Dash no it doesn't actually avax has the chance the opportunity to try to put in a a another bottom here there are altcoins that do that right I mean adaa Bitcoin was a great example of that last cycle where it found some lows that can happen there's no it's not set in stone but because the FED hasn't pivoted what I keep saying is is why take the risk RK of the altcoins when they're just bleeding back to bitcoin that doesn't mean they're not going to be successful it doesn't mean that they can't ultimately give you great returns over a long period of time but if you're in a period where an asset is bleeding for three years against a lower risk asset it kind of just makes sense to hold the lower risk asset right I mean look I mean guys dot Bitcoin just put on a new low last week you know and this this is the this is the thing that I dealt with back over here in October everyone's saying well I missed the low on do Bitcoin because I didn't buy it in October and now it's just at another low I mean the problem is I don't care about timing the bottom on this stuff right I just don't want to buy a falling knife you know I'd rather buy it in an uptrend after the fed's pivoted than to keep buying it as it bleeds the people that will give me the hardest time about it are the people that bought it all the way down you know I'm not saying it's going to bleed forever I'm not saying it won't I'm just saying it hasn't even had the chance to bottom because the FED hasn't pivoted yet so Bitcoin has been stronger than a lot of the other alts right if 20,000 SATs breaks the next support level is 12,000 now I've seen some people talk about Soul dominance because it's been doing pretty well here right but this also reminds me of a prior altcoin Trend not it doesn't remind me of a prior altcoin but it reminds me of a trend you'll sometimes see where the dominance of an altcoin puts in a high one cycle and then it sweeps the high a cycle later and then it just goes down what am I talking about right there's not a lot of altcoins that do that in fact I mean I imagine most altcoins don't do that where they put in a high on dominance and they put in a higher high so first of all credit where credit is due I mean congrats to salana for achieving that I'm not again I I that's just a fact I'm not going to try to take anything away from it it's just a fact that it has put in a higher high right that's an achievement does that mean it will continue indefinitely no could it push up again one more time it's possible but this isn't the first time I've seen something like this happen xrp dominance look at what it did first cycle put in a high later on on sweep the high it's been going lower ever since right so it's always easy to you know to call for these major events in in the altcoin market and to think they're going to go up against Bitcoin and and get a lot of market share these are all patterns we've seen before right in fact I I hear a lot of people talking about people I've heard a lot of people say that that soul will flip e but what's funny about that is guess when those narratives become the strongest at range highs this is the sole eth valuation they become the strongest at range highs so you have to be careful with this stuff right again salana has done very well this year if you have held it you've done very well over the last year and a half just be careful because because you know I I've seen these things happen before where you'll see dominance put on a new high for the altcoin you'll see it go back up to the Range High on its eth pair sometimes on its Bitcoin pair and it still doesn't change the longer term Trend altcoins are great for making money but rotating back into Bitcoin is the way you keep it that's the way you keep it if you hold the altcoin for too long you can watch it diminishing you can watch it diminish against its Bitcoin valuation eth Bitcoin eth Bitcoin gives great returns in a QE bull market it absolutely sucks in a qt bull market even though ethereum does really well in QE bull markets it's still been putting in lower highs since 2017 you know that's a fact now it's also been putting in higher lows right and I'll talk about that more if this plays out like I've I've talked about I mean I don't mind talking about now right these these are higher lows I'm not hiding behind it I was bullish on E Bitcoin in 2019 my first video on my channel is right there saying it's severely undervalued you know so don't come at me with this BS of well why don't you talk about the higher lows why don't you guys acknowledge that it's been in a downtrend for two and a half years and really it's been putting in lower highs since June of 2017 you know you know how everyone gives people a hard time to invest in gold because it hasn't put in or now it has put in a new high but it hadn't put on a new high for like 10 years what about the eth Bitcoin valuation it's 3 years away from not putting in a new high in a decade so I mean if we make it to 2027 and eth eth still hasn't put in a new high against Bitcoin then don't go get the gold bugs a hard time you invested in an asset that went down against a lower risk asset again I'm going to be bullish on the eth Bitcoin valuation but I still think it needs to go to 03 to 04 and then we're going to figure out what's more important the higher lows or the lower highs I honestly don't know the answer to that question I could I can make a compelling case either way honestly I could you might think you know my view but you can't know my view because I don't know my view on it I don't know what's more important the lower highs or all these higher lows right I don't know how could I know it looks like it's breaking down here to me but that doesn't mean that it's not on some type of logarithmic regression Journey you know where just like Bitcoin USD follows like a logarithmic regression Journey maybe eth Bitcoin is following one too where it just kind of falls back in to this range here oscillates around it for a while and then goes up and then we finally figure out what's more important the lower highs or the higher lows I don't know others Bitcoin the bane of my existence for all of 2024 because everyone's told me how it's only going to go up others Bitcoin in this Wick took out all of its gains since the summer of 2023 in a single week right that's what the markets do you take the stairs up convince everyone there right and then you take the elevator down other there's Bitcoin just swept lows it had not seen since July of 2023 back when this whole thing began for the altcoin market so I look at this and I know that a lot of people people have been bullish on others Bitcoin since the year began but guess what others Bitcoin basically topped out at the beginning of the year and then it went down it put in a lower high and then it dropped and now it's going back up it's going back up what's going on do you guys remember earlier when I said a lot of times it's like the fourth time that it breaks right you tag the trend line enough the fourth time it breaks you remember eth Bitcoin we talked about that eth Bitcoin here this time it theoretically broke the third time if you get if you get a uh uh another bounce in the bullmark sport ban and then break it would be the fourth time but if you look at last cycle you can see that it was the fourth time right one two three and break sometimes those trend lines occur are not horizontal trend lines but but um diagonal trend lines now diagonal trend lines are a bit hand wavy they're kind of fluffy if we're being honest I'm not going to don't take it to the bank they're not cashing it in type thing but if you look at others Bitcoin on The Daily what do you notice there's a trend line you can draw and if you look at this you can connect the dots and say huh One Tap two three break what if the move now is just a back test of the trend line to confirm that that is actually not resistance I don't know I mean if it breaks through here I would say the bullmark sport ban will will reject it but I don't even know if it's going to break through here but you can see that right you can see that one two three fourth attempt break remember last cycle it was after eth Bitcoin broke down that eth USD had a larger pullback right it was after eth Bitcoin broke down remember that right if you go if you overlay ethusd if you overlay ethusd onto the chart you'll see it right eth Bitcoin broke here and then ethusd had a correction eth Bitcoin technically already broke and you can see that ethusd is potentially in the middle of a correction but you know those trend lines we were talking about that fourth attempt if you look at ethusd kind of see something similar right on a log scale anyways trend line right sort of a fake out right there if you want to call it that right but one two three if it comes back down it might finally break and if it finally breaks then we go to the lower regression band right so I'm there's a lot of things right there's a lot of different things that you know we can look at here but you get the idea right we're seeing a lot of this play out and remember last cycle after eth Bitcoin broke it ethusd fell back through the wedge right so you can kind of see it's falling back through potentially back through the wedge here in the summer months right and now remember when it fell through the wedge last cycle e Bitcoin bottomed like one month after it fell through the wedge so if eth USD falls through the wedge in May then maybe eth Bitcoin Bottoms in June right the other thing to remember is that last cycle Bitcoin dominance kept going up even after gold broke out right so if you look at Bitcoin dominance and you overlay gold and you look at at at last cycle right you can see that that gold broke out right here and then dominance topped so this was uh gold broke out in like early June and then dominance topped so that' be July August so three months later so gold here it depends on if you want to say December but really it was it was you know potentially February um if gold broke out in February March April May maybe dominant it stops out in May or maybe you know around May or June right so a lot of it I mean a lot of it seems like it it could be lining up it's just a really it's a really slow process right it's a really slow process and um you know when you when you sort of see these moves by others Bitcoin where you spend the entire year where it's sort of grinding higher but the top was the week of December 25th right I mean that was the top so like yeah a lot of people have been bullish on others Bitcoin and they've been telling me well you keep talking about total three but you should be looking at others which is everything outside of the top 10 oh you tell me right I mean as far as I can tell the top was in back over here in December late December early January and all you guys got excited that were bullish on this got excited over a lower high because now it's put in a lower low remember what happened last cycle with others and I learned the lesson the hard way and I keep telling you guys that this is the lesson I learned the hard way and instead of people saying oh okay they give me every reason why I'm wrong but remember last cycle others others Bitcoin others divided by Bitcoin dropped 60% it rallied 60% and then it dropped 60% and it bottomed out when the FED pivoted now look at this it's the same thing others Bitcoin dropped 60% it then rallied 60% almost 70% and uh the the FED is not pivoted and now from this high it's already down 30% right it's already down 30% which is again I I called for this when it was at the highs it's not like I'm just now saying it right I mean every Bitcoin Dominus video for the last three months has been saying this very thing that others Bitcoin is probably going to drop 60% let already dropped 30 it's back up to only being down 15 or 17 or so but if it were to go down 60% that puts it all the way down here at 0.1 connect the dots connect the dots right exhibit a b and c just like over here you connect the dots one two three is where it bottomed when the fed pivoted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing so I know some of these micro caps have been doing very well but when these Wicks happen like this and those alts get rinsed on their Bitcoin pairs that's why it shows you it's important to take profits back to bitcoin occasionally so that you preserve the Satoshi valuation of your portfolio because then what ends up happening is everyone who rode this up and mocked me on bitcoin dominance then potentially finds themselves down here in a few months and then they're wondering why they didn't take any any profits on random memec coin number 475 right then they wonder why they didn't do it and it'll seem so obvious right it'll seem so obvious like why did they think that was going to outperform bitcoin as you know as higher rates continued and as quantitative tightening continued why did they think that because of the community I guess you know because of the community but the community I mean I I mean honestly doesn't really mean a damn thing in in tighter tighter monetary policy so and the communities are really all the same um anyways so yeah I mean I think Bitcoin dominance uh it is in a pullback right now admittedly um there's no doubt about it you know you're you're from 57 down to 55 in a relatively short we even went below 55 in a relatively short period of time so I acknowledge that and I'm I'm not going to you know that's why I try to address this head on because I know people are be like why is we talk about dominance but you know the the the the the crazy thing about it is no matter how many times it puts in a new high on any pullback people like why does he not talk about it but um here we are I mean we went to 57% we're back down to 55 I think we're just in sort of a pullback like this one before ultimately going back up um and that's sort of the more conservative view the more the less conservative view is that we already had that and we're already we know we're just up here and you know this is going to quickly continue back to the upside right so definitely a couple of different ways uh that you could that you could look at it but um those are my views you know and and those are the reasons why I have been bullish on bitcoin dominance for the last two and a half years since really since like May of 2021 um and I know that we swept the lows on dominance going over here and really I mean I sort of flirted with the idea of being bullish on dominance over there I said okay it's going to be bullish going into Q4 of 2022 or sorry bullish and going into Q4 of 2021 but then in Q4 of 2022 I sort of doubled down on that even on the lower low and then you can see what happened right now if you exclude Stables it did bottom in May of 2021 right that's it did bottom in May 2021 and also by the way the social risk topped out in May of 2021 so in order to see Bitcoin dominance go down durably you need to see retail come back retail is not back new highs didn't bring him the having hasn't brought him what's going to bring him probably lose their monetary policy and when they turn the money printer back on but social risk just put in a lower low kind of like it did over here in mid 2019 which is yet another reason why I think Bitcoin dominance is going to keep on going up because as people leave that's when dominance goes up so when could it top I think it might top this summer when everyone's out touching grass not looking at the crypto Market because that's the best time for all Bitcoin pairs to bottom out when no one's looking at the market and no one is there to bid up the altcoins there's some people there that are B going to bid them up but they're just not enough people and there's just too many alt coins for them to all get that same bid and so they just keep on bleeding back to the king then finally altcoins capitulate they go down to 25 on their on their Bitcoin pairs right total three minus usdt by Bitcoin they go down to 0.25 everyone's Bitcoin Maxi and then finally Al altcoins bottom out against Bitcoin but I don't think we're there yet I do admit that you know we are you know we certainly have seen a pretty big pullback by Bitcoin dominance it's possible that that that pullback continues for a couple more weeks um but I I really do think that whatever happens over the next week or to it's just going to continue to go up um as we get as we get into the summer and then I I think it might finally top out uh potentially this summer it could take a little bit longer but that's my um that's my base case you know and and because I think that Bitcoin gives you exposure to the upside it minimizes your downside risk for me for Bitcoin USD I just take profits as it goes off the wristbands I have some exposure if we're still at at kind of like somewhat heated but not all the way up wristbands um but you know I think it's important to to also you know if you want to take profits as you get into some of those higher risk levels I think that's okay you know it doesn't mean you have to sell everything but you could offload a little bit that way if there is a larger pullback you at least took some off the table and if there's not a larger pullback then at least you um at least you still have some and and that's why I continue to think that Bitcoin is the better place to be and and my guess is that the way this will play out is that Bitcoin will will do better than the altcoin market going into the summer and um whether it goes up or down so if you want exposure to the upside Bitcoin gives that to you it minimizes your downside risk I think that'll all change after the FED pivots but it hasn't pivoted yet and again it doesn't mean that Bitcoin can't go down I mean it can and I'm I'm sort of just waiting for that moment when you start when you do get a Bitcoin pullback and then people are like well you know what about what about a Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio now that doesn't help but that's all just going to be recency bias you know the reality is that Bitcoin could drop you know 50% from here and be in line with where it normally is in the market cycle that's the reality that that I think a lot of people would not accept if it were to happen but that is the reality of the situation if you look at Roi after cycle Peak for Bitcoin and you take it out to the folling peak Bitcoin could drop 60% from here and be at where it was was in Prior Cycles at this point in the cycle right a 50 to 60% drop and if it happens everyone will be like well they did call the Bitcoin having right 50 to 60% drop and and it would be where it normally is and if that happens all Bitcoin pairs get rined right they get rined there's one thing I I want to finalize U with saying for a long time I I've said that I I think that you know all Bitcoin pairs bottom out before alt USD pairs do um whether the alt USD pairs putting in a higher low or a lower low or a double bottom whatever um but I've said that a lot of times alt USD pairs bleed for a few months after alt Bitcoin pairs find their bottom and we see that all Bitcoin pairs just put in a new load last week um but I I do think there is a potential case where all Bitcoin pairs bottom the same time is all USD pairs it's not I don't I wouldn't say it's my base case but there is a chance that that could happen if it does happen I think it would have to happen on a on a capitulation Wick so if you get a a sort of a capitulation Wick by Bitcoin where it drops a lot and all Bitcoin pairs are just capitulating and then you get a big bounce out of that upon money printer being turned back on there's a chance they could bottom at the same time base case is that they still bottom you know you still see all USD pairs bleed for a little bit even after all Bitcoin pairs bought them but I I could see I I could see an outcome where they bought them at the same time and so I I want to be diligent about exploring that idea based on on whatever potential outcome there is and the reason why I say that is because if there is you know sort of a larger capitulation in the in the traditional markets and it takes Bitcoin down with it um because actually bitcoin's holding up better right now than traditional markets if you look at at sort of the weekly time frame and you look at something like the bull market sport band you can see bitcoin's above its bull market sport band whereas the S&P is already at its bullmark sportband and the NASDAQ is below it and the Russell is below it right so crypto right now I mean bitcoin's actually holding up better than traditional markets that doesn't mean it's going to forever but it is so far this has been going on a long time and I I do wonder if there's there I I I wonder if there exists a scenario that when the unemployment rate hits 4% the market capitulates because it's kind of in that number that everyone keeps waiting for and waiting for and it just keeps not happening if it hits it I could see the market capitulating and then the FED coming to the rescue almost immediately and if that happens there does exist a scenario where alt bottom against Bitcoin the same time as they do against the US dollar in that scenario whether it's a higher low or lower low whatever right be aware of that it depends on if it's a capitulation or if it's a slow bleed right and what I mean by that is in 2019 it was a slow bleed and then eventually we got a capitulation again induced by a pandemic but there's other things that indu that can induce capitulations right we also had a capitulation over here in late 2018 and we didn't have a pandemic back then right so it depends on the nature of how this how this resolves right if you get a period of lower highs and lower lows like you know just kind of like that then Bitcoin dominance likely goes up until Bitcoin breaks below the 20we SMA if on the other hand you just get a massive capitulation wick on a 4% unemployment rate if inflation is still printing you know between 3 to 4% then they could it could occur at the same time so I just want to make sure that I communicate that potential idea it it's going to depend on the nature of the move right whether it's lower highs and lower lows or just simply a capitulation by the way there does theoretically exist a scenario and I will continue to keep mentioning it of a left translated cycle where all these views about a lower high lower low thing are invalid and we just keep on following what we historically have done um based on a a prior Peak rather than uh the final Peak so if you look at Peak to Peak from November it looks like bitcoin's ahead of schedule if from November 2021 if you take it from April 2021 it kind of looks like this is where it was in the last cycle and then you can see what happened so again it's not my base case to assume that but if that happens then then you likely get a much brutal bear Market that lasts for a lot longer so I hope that doesn't happen honestly um because it would probably lead to a more brutal be Market kind of like a DOT style crash if you can kind of just top out here and bleed into the sun then the the cycle might peek out when it normally does um if on the other hand you just get a left translated cycle it it'll be fun for a few months right I mean it would be fun for a few months but it would probably be over before you know it I mean you know maybe three more months and then it's over and then you have a brutal bare Market that is really difficult you know so I kind of hope it doesn't do that because of the ramifications that that would mean following it um but if it does that would just be you know just something to think about right something something at least to be aware of and I I I don't know I really don't know if that's going to play out or not I just I I I do have it in the back of my head of like um a what if right a what if thing like you know what if it it it continues to follow that again not my base case and and you know looking at things like um you know the S&P struggling and and looking at like the Russell struggling i' I mean you know if you were to if you were expecting a a left translated Peak that goes into the summer then I I would I would think that you would that would be on the back of of traditional markets continuing to go up but traditional markets are not going up right now they're actually they've started to go down um so that would be something to look at I mean you can look at maybe this trend line here on the NASDAQ and see that you know for it to hit that trend line it would still have to go down even even a little bit more um for the S&P that same trend line um you know if you draw it out here it would obviously be a lot further out if you take it to this one and just kind of call that a a fake out it would still have a little bit lower to go to ultimately hit that trend line but yeah I mean I think that's where we stand and you know I really don't know if the left translated peak's going to happen one crazy idea is that there could be scenario where the left translated Peak is already in you know in March I mean the dot crash actually started in March of the election year so that is that is a possibility again it's it's honestly not my base case it's really not but it is something to consider that when you have these and one of the reasons why it probably wouldn't be my base case is because the Bitcoin risk hasn't gone up all the way to the 0.9 to one wristband um if Bitcoin does do something like that and it just continues to go up then um then yeah I mean then you could have then you could have that example but I'm not I'm not I'm not seeing it at the moment right I'm just not seeing it at the moment um I'm instead you're you're just kind of seeing all Bitcoin pairs go down and you're also seeing all USD pairs go down right I mean a lot of these altcoins are are really struggling here right I mean like madic is is nowhere near you know where you would expect to see some of these coins in a in a left translated cycle I mean in fact it looks more like it's closer to final capitulation than it is a a major top you know um USD is only 50% off the low or 100% off the lows right it's not in the grand scheme of things is not like thousands of percent off the lows right Ada Litecoin they're they're they're closer to their lows than they are to their highs um so that's why I would I would potentially argue that it's more likely that you're getting closer to to the end of that than the than I a potentially left translated Peak um but that is something that uh sort of keep in mind um for for at least a little bit longer so again not my base case uh but there are certainly things to think about it and there's there was one thing that I I I do look at from time to time is as sort of like a uh a left translated um uh evidence or something and that's the the launch the QQQ um which you know tracks the NASDAQ it actually launched in um you know here in 1999 it actually launched around 48 $48 U which is funny because when Bitcoin spot ETF launched it launched at 48k and then you can see that the spot ETF or sorry the the QQQ went all the way up to 120 so if Bitcoin were to go to 120 then maybe there's more evidence of a left translated Peak however when when this went from 48 to 120 it took it a full year right I mean it it went it took it from March until um you know until the following March right so that's a long time and really it didn't even get up into the 70s until November which was more than half a year after it launched Bitcoin has already gone into the into the 70s and it did it almost immediately after the launch right so that's why you could you know you could there could be a left translated Peak but maybe it still doesn't occur until like the end of the year or early next year again it's still I mean if it's early last year then it's not really a left translated Peak it's just a normal Peak but um thus just some evidence for the whole left translated thing again I'm not a big proponent of the idea I respect the people that are is the point right I respect the people that are and I value their opinion and so because they talk about it I find I find it important and you know I will I'll continue to track it um but I also I also think that if at the end of the day you know price action is King and technically Bitcoin put in its top in November of 2021 not April so if you take it from there you can kind of see that Bitcoin has a lot of wiggle room here it could fall back in and still be on track with the prior Cycles so imagine that happens if Bitcoin falls back in as it falls back into the prior Cycles that's where Bitcoin dominance tops and then Bitcoin continues its rally but at that point it continues the rally as Bitcoin dominance goes down that's kind of what I could see happening um just sort of tie it all in and put a bow on it so we'll see we'll see what plays out hopefully you guys enjoyed the content if you do make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out into the cryptoverse premium and into cryptoverse decom I'm losing my voice I don't know how long the video is it's probably too long I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-04-21 00:00:00,"Bitcoin dominance has put in a new cycle high of 57%, contrary to expectations that it had already topped. The speaker argues this is due to the timing of the dominance top being more closely tied to monetary policy than the typical 4-year market cycle. As the Federal Reserve continues quantitative tightening and delays rate cuts, the speaker expects Bitcoin dominance to continue rising, potentially reaching 60%. The speaker acknowledges the process is not linear, with potential pullbacks, but believes the general resolution will be to the upside.The speaker analyzes Bitcoin dominance excluding stablecoins, noting a similar pattern of lower highs followed by a sweep of the previous high, just as occurred in the previous cycle. This suggests Bitcoin dominance could see one more pullback before resuming its ascent towards 60%. The speaker believes this is due to the close relationship between Bitcoin dominance and monetary policy, as opposed to the typical 4-year market cycle.Regarding Ethereum against Bitcoin, the speaker suggests it could bottom around June if there is no bounce, aligning with historical seasonal weakness for Ethereum in the summer months. However, the speaker cautions against relying too heavily on trend lines, as altcoins can sometimes break below them before finding a bottom. The speaker expects altcoin pairs against Bitcoin to continue bleeding, with the potential for a 42% drop to the range lows around 0.25 BTC, as they have historically oscillated between 0.25 and 1 BTC.The speaker further elaborates on the relationship between Bitcoin dominance and monetary policy, noting that Bitcoin dominance tends to rise even after assets like gold break out, as seen in the previous cycle. The speaker suggests Bitcoin dominance could top out in the summer months, as that is typically when retail investors are less active in the market, allowing altcoins to bleed back to Bitcoin.The speaker also discusses the potential for a scenario where altcoin pairs against Bitcoin and altcoin pairs against the US dollar could bottom at the same time, if a larger capitulation in the traditional markets leads to a significant Bitcoin drawdown. However, the speaker's base case remains that altcoin pairs against Bitcoin will bottom first, before altcoin pairs against the US dollar continue to bleed for a period.Overall, the sentiment remains bullish on Bitcoin dominance and bearish on altcoins, particularly Ethereum, based on the speaker's analysis of monetary policy and market cycles.",483,"[0.044525146, -0.015617371, -0.0014629364,

Hi, we are now at the or about to be at the 2024 Bitcoin having this is the fourth having the first one was in November of 2012 I believe second one July of 2016 the third one may of 2020 and then now the fourth one April of 2024 and as far as I'm I mean it's if you're in the states it's April 19th but Bitcoin is a global thing and UTC time is April 20th so the having will then theoretically be on April 20th for those operating under UT C time at this moment we have two blocks to go as you can see there's no way to know exactly how long it'll be uh some of them get taken out really quickly some of them obviously take a lot longer it's you know somewhat random so we don't know I mean you know it could be 10 more minutes it could be half an hour could be an hour all right there's no way to know how long it'll be but we'll keep an eye on it currently we have two blocks to go right so once we get to one block then I guess it'll be a little bit more exciting but right now we have two blocks to go and and Bitcoins currently coming in at around 63,0 743 so um we'll keep an eye on that you know there's certainly been a pretty bad week in the markets not just crypto but also in the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ as well uh you might have noticed in fact that the uh the NASDAQ and the S&P have fallen back to their B Market support bands the nasdaq's actually below it and so if again there's no guarantee right but if there is sort of a posst having dump uh keep an eye on that bull market support band by Bitcoin because it's it's you know it's it's not that much further down all things considered and and we know that the nasdaq's already there I mean the nasdaq's already below that level um and so I I think it's important to just kind of recognize that and if if memory serves me correct there was actually a dump right after 2016 having as well but I would I would keep an eye on that here as we go into the having just in case we do see something like that still two blocks to go also bear in mind that as measured from the peak Bitcoin is well ahead of schedule right well ahead of schedule and so I've I've said many many times that whenever Bitcoin sort of falls back into line with the prior Cycles that's when altcoins theoretically bottom out on their Bitcoin Pairs and and the AL the altcoin Reckoning will will then end but as far as I'm concerned again considering that the altcoin Reckoning is based on their Bitcoin Pairs and considering that altcoins keep putting in new lows on their Bitcoin pairs I think we are about to enter into a probably a somewhat boring summer where all Bitcoin pairs finally bottom out we've been waiting forever uh to see that happen and we are now about to I believe see that happen still two blocks remaining all Bitcoin pairs in fact put in a new low last week um so I do think this summer we could very well see that if you if you look at things like the social risk I mean the social risk is so low right now it's at 0.14 so despite the fact that we're knocking on the door of the fourth Bitcoin having no one cares you know I mean there's obviously people watching that care but in the grand scheme of things no one really cares and that's it's kind of interesting right it's kind of interesting to some degree um we still have let me reload this I I I don't think I need to but um two blocks to go but yeah I mean like like considering where the social interest was back over here compared to where it is today it's kind of crazy you know I mean it's just remarkable just how much lower the social interest is today and I think it has nothing to do with Bitcoin or whatever it just has to do with with this long and pain rate hiking cycle by the fed and they are trying to stay as high as and as long they're trying to keep rates as high as they can for as long as they can but I don't think they have that much more Runway I do think they're going to be forced to cut relatively um well sooner than probably the market thinks all right we have one block to go uh approximately nine minutes we'll see it could be any time but we do have one block to go there we go check it out over here I mean let me reload this should it should go down about 18 minutes according to that one but again it's just a guessing game no one knows exactly how long it'll take but it could be at any moment for the fourth Bitcoin having and of course we will keep an eye on the price of Bitcoin um I actually did live stream the last having as well um back uh four years ago almost four years ago it was May of 20120 but I did that live stream um so not very long guys uh we are almost there just a couple more just a few more minutes and we will be at the uh the fourth the fourth Bitcoin having so we'll see what price does um and and how that reacts but um and I'm also gonna I'm also going to see how eth Bitcoin reacts because it had a reaction after the spot ETF to the upside I don't really think it's necess I mean it could do that again it doesn't have to you guys know my thoughts on eth bitcoin I think it probably bottoms out this summer um but short-term reactions obviously are are very hard to predict just like the the the reaction of e Bitcoin after the spot ETF right it shot up and then just bled back down and put a new lows so I don't really know what the short-term reaction is going to be after the having is here but I do imagine there's going to be quite a lot of volatility in the markets um and we'll talk a little bit more about that after the having is actually here so still about one we got one block to go the last block was three minutes ago um you can see they're about every 10 minutes or so but it's not exact right sometimes they go a lot quicker than other times so not too long to go why do I think it's taking so much longer to rate 60% dominance this cycle than last I I think just because of inflation and the amount of time it's taking uh the FED to to really get that under control it's been delaying rate or rate cuts for a long time I think that's the reason so one block to go the last block was found about three minutes ago um Bitcoin still trading at $ 63,9 uh so we'll see what happens with that after the having is actually here make sure you guys subscribe if you're not subscribed and by the way thank you for um subscribing and and helping me to get to 800,000 subscribers today by the having that was pretty cool I saw someone make a snarky comment where they said can't wait to celebrate you passing 800,000 subscribers for the second time later this year after this summer low and there's probably some truth to that statement I I could totally see that happening like going above 800 then going below it for a little B then going back above it still one block to go um last block was found last block was four minutes to go so on average again it's about every you know every 10 minutes or so um but we will see how's everyone doing today Bitcoin is it oh there it goes there it goes the having has it looks like it has occurred so there it goes the next having will be approximately April 17th of 2028 and the new block subsidy will be 1.56 3 Bitcoin um per block uh but the having has arrived let me tweet it out pretty cool huh these are always pretty cool because they only have you know they only occur every four years you know so and I I do think that these events are are much more exciting to me than like um you know a lot of the other events that people talk about like the merge and like the Litecoin having really who cares about that but all these other events um you know the Bitcoin having I I think is is much more much more meaningful and I you know without Bitcoin the reality is is all you guys that are going full DJ into the altcoin market those altcoins wouldn't exist without Bitcoin so pay your respects to the king um especially on on the Bitcoin having so uh we will in fact see how the market reacts um to this let's see how it's doing we're at 638 638 eth is still not moving um eth Bitcoin still not moving again my base case here is eth Bitcoin bleeds into the Summer where it finally bottoms okay um it's been a long journey for eth Bitcoin to drop but I I think there's a little bit further for it to go to find its its final low and then it should I think it'll bottom this summer I think that Bitcoin dominance will Top uh in the next couple in the next few months or so and I'll tell you what I think's going to happen what I think's going to happen um is that look closely at at at Bitcoin right look very closely at Bitcoin you see where it is you see how high above the 20 we estimate it is you see that now look at eth you see how it's not that much further off of it and it's already Wick to it look at salana it's also been wicking off the 20we ese now look at some other alts look at Ada it's below the 20 we look at link it's below the 20 we look at dot it's below the 20 we look at madic below the 20 we look at Avalanche right below the 20 we a lot of these alts are below the 20 we we saw this exact same thing just before rake Cuts arrived in 2019 we saw all coins go below their 20we what happened next was that Bitcoin did something like this did something like this and during that period That's when Bitcoin dominance finally topped as Bitcoin chopped around just above the 20we moving average so what I think's going to happen over the next few months I think bitcoin's going to chop around um you know and and certainly that could mean going into the 50s um it could mean going back up to the week SMA you know in the high 60s as well it could bounce around but I think what's going to happen is that altcoins are going to get pinned under their bull market support bands while Bitcoin still stays above it for a little while right and when that happens when alts get pinned underneath their bull market support ban then when Bitcoin rallies when it gets relief rallies that's when all Bitcoin pairs break down so I think what happens is Bitcoin hangs around here for a little bit during that period it eats the altcoin market up then Bitcoin dominance tops before like not not 100% sure about this they don't hold me to this but I think Bitcoin dominance could top before Bitcoin USD Falls below its 20we moving average that's what I think right I think that it could top before that happens um and then as it goes underneath the 20we SMA then we just figure out how much damage the FED did and and then we just put up with them until they cut rates right aggressively and then and then the market goes back up but when that happens then guess what happens then Bitcoin dominance goes down during that period but we're not there yet I I still think that Bitcoin needs to chop up the altcoin market for just a little bit longer I think it needs to send e Bitcoin to about 03 to 04 but we're really not that far away nor normally when eth Bitcoin breaks down it takes about eight weeks it takes about eight weeks and and we you know we just completed basically the first week um so look for I I think about June you know I I think about the June time frame is when you might see eth Bitcoin bottom it could be a little bit later like maybe July it's going to depend on what eth Bitcoin does over the next couple of weeks if eth Bitcoin bounces over the next couple of weeks then I might say July but if it just kind of keeps fading which is my base case then maybe by June but in the meantime Bitcoin should chop around and during that chop for the next several weeks we should see theoretically we should see Bitcoin dominance go finally to 60% after all this time right after all this time I I I think we're we're almost there um I think we just need you know not not that much longer but I I think we are in the phase we're in the phase and I saw this happen last cycle where basically Bitcoin chopped around up here right after eth Bitcoin broke down after gold broke out it chopped around and during that time altcoins got pinned underneath their 20we moving average so when Bitcoin bounced the altcoin still stayed below their 20 we right they just stayed below their 20 we even though Bitcoin was bouncing above it so then when Bitcoin dropped below its 20 week right before that Bitcoin dominance top so the Milestones still look for Bitcoin dominance to go to 60% eth Bitcoin .03 to 04 um and and watch Bitcoin chop up the altcoin market here for for a couple more months after that I I think you might actually see some of these all alt Bitcoin pairs bottom out um at least the ones that are not relics right the truth is is 99% of them are relics but the 1% that are not relics might actually bottom out on their Bitcoin pairs uh by that point and some of them probably already have right I mean you know there's some that are up a lot those have probably already bottomed on their Bitcoin pairs but there's a lot of them that're just you know they're collectively the altcoin market is just putting in new lows right collectively you can see that they just put in a new low last week um so considering there's not really a strong reaction just yet by Bitcoin you know it might we might have to wait till next week to see what's going to happen um you also have the 8-week SMA which is up at around 67k I would keep an eye on that as well you know that was that was essentially what Bitcoin struggled with back in 2019 it basically kept bouncing around and that 8we moving average kept giving it trouble so I think we're entering into that phase I I think we're entering into that phase right now um where bitcoin's going to chop alt up for a little bit and then the next question that you might ask me is well then if this is the case if it really is 2019 repeat um how low does it have to go right how low does it actually have to go first of all no one on this Earth knows the answer to that question because it's going to be dependent on a lot of things that we don't have any control over right it's going to be dependent on monetary policy um could be dependent on geopolitical events but I will say this and I will say this if you go back and look and I I showed this earlier right if you go back and look at Roi after cycle Peak I just want you to look at this chart you know don't get mad at me right don't get mad at me just look at the chart and see where we are this cycle right we we have plenty of wiggle room here you know Bitcoin could drop all the way back down here and it still be in line with prior Cycles right that's what's crazy about it like it could drop all the way back down here to 60% below the high and still be where we were in the last two cycles at this time Bitcoin has that luxury altcoins do not because if Bitcoin does that most alts put in new lows right I said that I've said that for years I've said a lot of altcoins can put in new lows in the having year right in the having year even if Bitcoin doesn't even if Bitcoin just kind of stays in line with prior Cycles so be aware of that that if Bitcoin just gets that correction back to where it normally is around this time um keep an eye on those altcoins because that's where they really can uh can can take a hit but again we'll see I mean you know I I still think dominance is going to go up to that 60% level um I don't think it should take too much longer you know I mean if you look at it here it's possible for us to even go to you know back up to 57 58% in the just the next few weeks right in just the next few weeks um 60% is really not that far away when you think about it I mean I know I know when I said it at 38% 60% seemed like a pipe dream right but we've already gone to 57 you know 60% it's only another 3% above that so if e Bitcoin goes to the 03 to 04 Target that I've said forever if you have things like Ada going to 400 SATs and stuff I mean there you got it I mean you got your you got your 60% Bitcoin dominance um we're not that far away right we're not that far away and I think like we're you can kind of see the cycle you can kind of see how the cycle plays out right as as Bitcoin lifts the altcoin market up Bitcoin dominance goes up and then the next part of the cycle theoretically theoretically right again I could be wrong um believe it or not I do get things wrong a lot but theoretically the next phas the cycle is Bitcoin chops the altcoin market up up here and during that time Bitcoin pairs bleed Bitcoin dominance goes to 60% after Bitcoin dominance is at 60% then I think it falls below its 20we moving average so I'll say that again once Bitcoin dominance goes to 60% or thereabouts I think that Bitcoin USD will then fall below its 20we moving average and then how low alts go just depends on how low Bitcoin goes because by that point you go to the period where all Bitcoin pairs could actually go up no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD we're not at that phase yet I don't think we're at that phase yet but I think that phase is going to start this summer so I think that phase will start this summer um and that that'll that that'll be like an interesting shift in the cryptoverse right but in the meantime I still think alts need to you know need to go lower on their on their Bitcoin pairs the alt season that all of you seek the alt season that you guys want can only occur from higher Bitcoin dominance levels right it I I think it needs to occur at least up here once you're up there then you're you're sort of you can get ready for a potential um you know for for other types of moves in the market right but you know and I know what some of you guys are thinking you're like what about the last you know what about all these alts that have already done well guys you know all season again is when Bitcoin dominates craters like this that's what that's what all season is this is not all season this is Bitcoin season and everyone thinking that because their altcoin went up with Bitcoin it was altseason but it was never altseason it was Bitcoin season and some of the altcoins uh tagged long for the ride alt season is when Bitcoin profits go into alts you're not seeing that right you're seeing you're seeing the reverse of that you're seeing Bitcoin suck the liquidity out of alt and it's because Bitcoin sucks the liquidity ad Vols which is what causes it generally to just chop around up here for a while right it's because it sucks that liquidity out of alts alts aren't sucking liquidity out of anything right they're just they're just you know they're just the liquidity is leaving them going back to bitcoin um so it's interesting how this cycle is playing out I do think it will continue to play out uh in the way that um that I've been describing qualitatively quantitatively again it's it's it's hard to know um exactly you know where the highs are for dominance and where the lows are for eth Bitcoin and whatnot but um that's what I would expect anyways there you have it you have the 2024 Bitcoin having bitcoin's at you know 63 60 63.8k um I don't know I really don't know what's gonna happen this weekend I maybe it'll just be a boring weekend you know I don't know I just know that uh you know the NASDAQ and the S&P didn't really have the best end to the uh best end of the week but we'll see what Bitcoin does here um any questions yeah gold is doing pretty well but um it I mean it it's that phase of the cycle right it's you know pre- rate Cuts that's what normally when gold starts to do well and if if Bitcoin if Bitcoin does move up into the uh into the weekend the eight week is what you look for right the 8we it can go slightly above it too just like in 2021 and in and in 2019 but I would I would keep an eye on that eight moving average um going out into the um at least probably the next couple of weeks right like the next few weeks keep an eye on the 8 week and if we go to the bull market support ban first um then obviously the 8 week SM will roll over but if we go up to the eight-week first then it's already you know it's just over 67 just over 67k on shorter time frames right if you look at shorter time frames you can see that that um if we look at Bitcoin USD this is almost the opposite of what we saw um it's almost the opposite of what we saw going into the spot ETF actually because going into the spot ETF we didn't see this trend line break until after the spot ETF right this time this trend line broke before the spot ETF and and eventually we came down here and and ran the lows right we we ran these lows we um swept the lows after the spot ETF this time we still haven't swept this low we've gotten pretty close to it still haven't swept it yet you do have this trend line this is the same trend line that it kind of held resistance at right there a little bit right there as well so if you do see a move back up I would also I would also watch that trend line which is going to correspond right to that eight-week moving average but um that's where we are let's see if the Bitcoin dominance can still run here I've seen some people speculate that they some people have thought that dominance would top around the having I still think like the spot ETF it's going to go a little bit higher you know I do think it's going to run a little bit longer um and then and then I think it'll it'll probably top out sometime maybe sometime later this summer is my guess that's just my guess all right um twin limbo fees someone says did it half yet yes it did when accounting for M2 to bitcoin reach a new high yet uh I believe so yeah yeah it did yeah we can even Connect the Dots here and see that it almost lines up perfectly yeah I mean it it did it did hit a a new high when accounting for um uh for M2 is a longterm still up for Bitcoin well I mean I look guys markets are are are volatile in both directions I do think long-term Bitcoin still goes up but I also you know I also think that um it wouldn't be the worst thing to to have a a boring summer let all Bitcoin pairs bottom out that's kind of my view um but yeah I I do think long term it's it's up for Bitcoin but you're G to have I you're going to have some speed bumps along the way for the last two and a half years I think you know just having your crypto portfolio be Bitcoin heavy was kind of the easiest thing to do especially in a Bitcoin dominance uptrend I think this summer late summer especially I think think that you know could theoretically change as Bitcoin dominance you know maybe tops out um later this summer but um those are my views um um someone says they can't bring themselves to sell Bitcoin uh I don't think I mean yeah you gota you got to do what makes sense for you you know I mean also too I mean a lot of times when you sell Bitcoin you have to consider the tax implications as well um you know when I talk about what I think bitcoin's going to do like it doesn't mean like oh you should go buy or sell Bitcoin it's just dubious speculation guys I mean I'll let you on a little secret I don't know what's going to happen you know um you guys have to remember that you really have to remember that it's just dubious speculation someone says the FED supposed to cut rates this summer right now the market doesn't think they're going to cut rates this summer I think there's a chance they could cut rates this summer but right now the market says no rate Cuts until September more than likely I think they're probably going to cut in June or July um but that's that's just my guess that's just my guess do I have any altcoin picks for when for when dominance stps out I think that you know I I think the main thing to look at will be ethereum and obviously there's other things you can look at as well but the the the the E Bitcoin should give you the sign you know because I E Bitcoin dropping you know normally is a bad Omen for the altcoin market I I told I told you guys guys that for years so when it dropped a couple of weeks ago I warned you know I warned that altcoins were likely going to get a big drop and they did did a lot of altcoins did get a big drop a lot of people are telling you to buy the dip on alts it doesn't mean you can't have short-term rallies back up in alts but I I do I do think there is a good chance that um eth Bitcoin is going to go 0.3 to 0.4 and if that happens I I do I really do think that altcoins will take a bigger haircut than they already have someone says have you not paid attention there's absolutely nothing that suggests a rate cut in June you know here's the funny thing um if you watched what I said in 2022 about monetary policy I said that the FED would go to 5 and a half per. and no one believed me right everyone said no they're going to stop at 3% they're going to stop at three and a half now they went to 5 and a half per. so when no one believed it I said 5 and a half% would be the terminal rate now what I think's happening everyone believes higher for longer higher for longer is getting priced in now look at the look at the market only two rate cuts are being priced in for an entire year and you know what happened now that only two rate cuts are priced in do you know what happened the S&P is dropping right the S&P is dropping the NASDAQ is dropping last cycle the FED cut one one meeting after all Bitcoin pairs broke down it cut it cut one meeting after all Bitcoin pairs broke down I don't think they're going to cut in May okay unless something catastrophic happens between now and may I don't think they're going to cut in May but there is a chance they cut in June or July right there is now again you know you're probably looking at it and saying you know what's been smoking there's like only a 16% chance or 37% chance in July but I'm telling you these probabilities change all the time when I said the terminal rate was 5 and a half% this Market did not expect anywhere near 5 and a half per. I think that people are underestimating how quickly the FED will pivot when the labor market shows weakness that's what I think people are underestimating they will pivot very very quickly if the labor market shows weakness you have two more unemployment rate prints between now and the June meeting okay two more and do you know what happened at the June print for the unemployment rate last year that was the big spike up that was the big spike up look at the unemployment rate in um in uh last year do you see here it was dropping February March April remember you get the April data in May you get the May data in June in June we got the May data and it spiked from 34 to 37 now imagine if it goes from if it goes from 38 or 37 to four in June just before the the FED meeting on June 12th if you see it if they see it at 4% I think there's a good chance they going to cut which would be funny because that might be just about one month after all Bitcoin pairs finally break down so you know I know I know No One Believes it but I've said this a thousand times probably the pricing out of rate Cuts causes them to get priced back in because once the market believes the FED once they believe them then businesses change their spending they lay people off and it changes it it it affects the economy but you have to convince the animal spirits that they mean business the FED has finally convinced people but in the process of convincing people they're probably going to have to start cutting sooner than the market expects so that's why I think they could cut earlier than September I'm not married to that idea honestly the the the economy has been very very strong but I I saw something similar last cycle just be aware that they could cut before September especially if if the markets keep unfolding like we see them unfolding right now uh Bitcoin dominance is now at 55. 72 so it's still doing pretty well so far someone says I heard that since the FED can't control inflation the likely of rate Cuts happening in July is unlikely to September for the election before we probably get one I don't know I mean you know in 2019 we got one in in July and then September and October some or no September and then yeah something like that um I think it was July September and October I think they'll give us I I think they're going to give us one in the summer I that's what I think but just the token one you know probably not enough to move the needle but someone says same story fed cuts and Bitcoin dominates hasn't been wrong yeah for those who are just tuning in the uh the Bitcoin having has occurred um so the block rewards have been reduced to 1.56 3 and the next having is now scheduled or approximately going to be April of 2028 it's probably going to be earlier in the year than April every cycle it seems to move up a little bit um so maybe it'll be March um or something but that's where it is right now uh someone says the S&P is hitting its bullmark sport Ben you think it'll have a bounce that's a great question I was looking at that at the close I was like oh what are the chances it's going to close right at that bullmark sport band right what are the chances right there at the 20we SMA uh yeah it definitely could right I mean it definitely could bounce off of this level the thing that's a little concerning is that the NASDAQ closed below it um so it's not as obvious like I mean I would have preferred for the NASDAQ to have closed above it uh in that case to to be a little bit more optimistic about the S&P bouncing so I don't know if you look at at at year-to-date Roi of um of the like let's go look at at the equity side of things year-to dat Roi and we're just going to look at at the S&P 500 in in election years so if you look at the S&P 500 this is uh 2024 and now average it out with all prior election years right so a lot of times in election years there's weakness so we're currently on day you know 110 oftentimes there's weakness until about day 140 in the 140s so about one more month of weakness so it's possible that it gets a bounce right it's possible that it gets bounce actually you can see over here the S&P fell to the 20we SMA and then it got a bounce right same thing it just fell about the same amount about 6% to the 20we SMA so you could get like a two- week rally um but it doesn't mean that the 20we SME will will hold I I could still see continued weakness into you know into um kind of the May time frame which is normally when you see that that weakness in in election years make sure you guys subscribe if you're not subscribed I would appreciate that and I do appreciate everyone subscribing and getting getting the channel to 800,000 subscribers yeah we we passed 800,000 um just uh just a few hours ago so I do appreciate everyone doing that and subscribing so uh let's see I I I think we we probably are going to see Bitcoin at the 20we SME um sometime you know before the end of May is my guess and it could happen a lot earlier than that but I do think it I mean it's been a long time since we tested it so I I I think we're GNA fall back into it on the not so distant future in a previous video you said it also Bott them out after they bought against Bitcoin how long do you think that'll take it's hard to say you know there sometimes it it if it plays out like it did 2019 it would just take a few months after after all Bitcoin pairs bought them but you have to remember every cycle is slight slightly different I could Envision a scenario where they bought them at the same time as their USG pairs I could especially considering how late how much later in the cycle it's occurring um but yeah if it were to play out like last cycle they you know they would bleed the USD pairs would bleed a little bit B longer than the Bitcoin pairs um you know not drastically longer but you know slightly longer but that's a good that's a good thing about alts because it's during that bleed that you can you can figure out which alts are are are strong ones because you know when they bottom out against Bitcoin that gives you the signal that it's not a relic right I'll say that again if you're altcoin hunting and you want to know which ones are going to do well in the future look to see which ones are setting lows against Bitcoin as Bitcoin Falls that's what you look for that's what I looked for last cycle it worked out really really well I would look for that just look to see which ones there's some alts that just keep putting in new lows against Bitcoin let me show you an example let me show you kind of a a process that I did last cycle so there were a lot of altcoins that you could have looked at last cycle but there's there were some I don't really want to get into it there were some that were putting in higher lows in their Bitcoin pairs there were some that were holding their lows in their Bitcoin Pairs and there were others that were going lower on their Bitcoin pairs the ones that just keep going lower on their Bitcoin Pairs and do not form a bottom over the next like say three to six months they're likely relics and you don't really need to pay attention to those if they form a bottom over the next three to six months on their Bitcoin pairs those are the ones that will likely do well so that's what you should look for in my opinion look for the ones that can can set a low against Bitcoin and then spend three to six months bouncing off of that low someone says eth Bitcoin keeps put putting in new lows is it I haven't I'm not even looking at it right now I mean it's at 0477 um so yeah I I do think it's going to go to 03 to 04 and I I think it's probably going to happen by you know likely by June but we'll see this is this whole process has taken a lot longer than I thought it would if the unemployment rate hits 4% do you think they'll cut even if inflation is this High yeah I do I do I I think there's going to be overwhelming pressure for them too especially considering it's an election year I I think they're going to cut if if we hit 4% in unemployment especially if it's accompanied by the stock market dropping again if you're if you're just joining uh the Bitcoin having has already occurred um so you know I got to tell you guys like I I find days like today a lot more interesting and exciting than like the countdown to New Year's like I feel like for the countdown to New Year's it's like uh gotta stay up till midnight but um but I I guess I do stay up the past midnight a lot of nights but um but for the the having I I think it's it's a lot more exciting you know just to see the having sort of get ushered in having is not postponed um what are my thoughts on Nvidia my thoughts on Nvidia kind of I think Cisco might be a good blueprint for NVIDIA um because it kind of It kind of topped out in March of the election year in 2000 so I think probably what you're going to see happen here is you're you're you're just going to see it fall back in maybe into the five to 600 range um and then and then bounce into the summer that's probably my guess is what's going to happen someone says rip Tesla you know Tesla funny because you know I was very vocally bearish on it in 2022 and um unfortunately I did not pivot my view when it hit a 100 but one one lesson for all investors is that business Cycles take a long time to play out right a really long time to play out and you know these are all lower highs you know I mean that's what they are they're all lower highs they've always been lower highs and it's this sort of these devaluations of these larger companies that are going to eventually I think Force the FED to Pivot um so yeah I mean it's just the business cycle takes a long time a really long time to play out but you can see it playing out I mean you could see it it's just it it's taking a very long time to do so someone said I thought the having was taking us to 3.125 not 1.5 it did take us to 3.125 5 what you're looking at is you're looking at this is the this is going to be the new subsidy for the next having so this is a having countdown for the fifth having so the new subsidy after the fifth having will be 1.56 three so you're just looking at at what it'll be after the next having not what it is currently coin and Mara Mara is an interesting one because you know essentially what mea did last cycle just before those rate Cuts arrive you can see I was actually already looking at it um what it did last cycle was it sort of had this one this top a higher high and then it it came back down it it sort of swept this low here and then went back up for a lower High um so I I wonder if that's about to happen um where it it it gets a move back up somewhere off of these lows and then puts in a lower high and then it basically then just bleeds until until you get enough rate cuts to send everything back up right so basically you know and this is this is what I this is what I told people you know on ITC premium a while back was we were looking at this whole pattern over here um and it's it's actually been doing it's been copying it pretty closely for a long time um actually um as you can see because this pattern I we you know we talking about it you know months ago and it seems like it just keeps playing out right a high a higher high back to the range low maybe you get a lower High um and and then you you sort of just bleed until the FED gets to the last rate cut and then you and then you send it back up um so that would be my view on on on something like meor someone says I can't tell if this is Live Well Apollo is King it is live do I think the altcoin market cap can keep up with Bitcoin when bitcoin's greater than 10 trillion or do you think Bitcoin dominance will continue to hire at that point I don't think I mean I I think the I think the market is is an oscillator right if you look at Bitcoin dominance plus USD dominance I it tells a fairly compelling story you know I I I just think that we're essentially in a range and we just sort of bounce around this range where we go from um you know we go from alt season to bitcoin season to alt season to bitcoin season and we're just right now we've been in the long path up of Bitcoin season but eventually we'll get to you know to um to the point where we go back to all season but and again this is Bitcoin dominance plus USD dominance um and if you add in plus e dominance looks like this right I mean you can see I mean it really does look you know sort of like an oscillator and we just go you know from Blue Chips to altcoins to Blue Chips to altcoins to Blue Chips right and we're we're still just in the process of going you know of going back up to the top of this range but this here can be devastating for all Bitcoin pairs that that last move can be that final capitulation can be devastating for all Bitcoin pairs so I mean I'm not asking you to go make any changes to your portfolio right now you know these views I've expressed about Bitcoin dominance were expressed you know two and a half years ago at this point the meat of the Bitcoin dominance move is over yeah I still think it's going to go higher but you know it might only go to 60% I mean my my target has been 6 % and that's not really that much higher than where it is right now so I mean it's it's already gone to 57 but I do think we're going to see this go up to 60% here in the next uh few months am I worried about the SEC investigating ethereum I couldn't give a flying you know what about what the SEC is doing with e um I also don't really care if the spot ETF is approved all I care about is the eth Bitcoin pair that's all I care about and and by the way the has had a pretty bad track record of going after anything so um they're pretty good at losing I'm not that concerned about what the SEC is doing I think that e Bitcoin bottoms out this summer I think people are probably going to blame it on the SEC or they're going to blame it on the rejection of the spot ETF but I don't really care what they blame it on um I I think it's going to be based on monetary policy and that's it and and you know all the narratives that come with that you know we can we can pretend like that stuff matters but I I just don't think it matters someone says happy Bitcoin happy Bitcoin having everyone yeah it's pretty cool day we got someone here from Australia do I think Bitcoin will fall to the less than point4 risk level in 2024 yeah I do I I do think it might not spend much time there but I I do think it will someone from Singapore and Texas even South Africa is uh here representing in Bulgaria another person we got a lot of people from like um Australia Mexico Quebec I've been to Quebec when am I going to DCA e well you know I mean when I DCA something I prefer that thing I'm dcing not to just bleed to bitcoin because if it is you just better off buying Bitcoin so the first thing that needs to happen for me to get interested in eth is it needs to bottom out on its Bitcoin pair you know I converted most of my eth to bitcoin here I converted more of it here or somewhere I don't remember where it was and then I converted the like basically almost the rest of it right there so i' I've been mostly out of ethereum for a long time in favor of Bitcoin just because I thought Bitcoin dominance was going to 60% but as it gets down into this range I I think um eth Bitcoin will likely bottom out and it'll start to go back the other way I've always wanted to go to New Zealand someone's from Greece I was going to go to Greece actually exactly four years ago I had a I had a trip planned for Greece in April of 2020 and you guys know what happened then right you guys know what happened in early 2020 so I wasn't able to go but I I was I was going to go to Greece and then that trip that whole trip got cancelled can I show the Bitcoin risk metric uh sure we can pull that up um it's currently at 638 currently 638 you can also view it like this as well that's where it currently is you see this guys I'm telling you eth is I think eth is going to fall back through this wedge just like it did over here after eth Bitcoin broke down you know after eth Bitcoin broke down over here it fell through the wedge eth Bitcoin just broke down and I mean to me it looks like it's just doing the same damn thing you know um we'll see if I'm wrong but last cycle eth Bitcoin broke down right here and then it fell through the eth USD fell through the wedge here eth Bitcoin just broke down and it looks like it's starting to fall back through that wedge someone says if we knew what was going to happen we'd all be rich that's a good statement that is true if everyone knew if we all knew what was going to happen uh we'd all be rich just buy Bitcoin and hold it until the fireworks start look guys I mean I'll be honest with you I mean the long-term winning strategy for Bitcoin is just DC it at low risk levels and ignore everything else that's the winning strategy I found for Bitcoin when the risk is low you buy when the risk is high you sell and you ignore everything else in between and usually if you do that you are very successful over the longer term can we take a look at the Bitcoin rainbow indicator yeah it's funny because it kind of topped out at that two and a half log line rule again I mean I know like it it you know a lot of people said no it's not going to happen but once again two and a half log lines down that's where it topped potentially what's funny is that this range over here corresponds exactly to where that that regression band would be someone ask if the having has already happened it has Bitcoin having on 420 feels good yeah let's just remember it as being on 420 I know some were going to be like oh it happen on April 19th but guys it's UTC time you know no one cares if you live in the states I live in the states but I operate on UTC time when it comes to bitcoin so as far as I'm concerned the having was on April 20th not April 19th in fact it's probably April it's yeah it's April 20th for more people in the world than it's April 19th Mi you guys subscrib if you're not subscribed um I think I think there's going to be some changes in the cryptoverse this summer I'm G to have to give you guys some new content because the dominance train is is probably going to be over this summer so um if you've been with me on that Journey we have a little bit longer to go I think but we're almost there what are my thoughts on the stock to flow model um oh look who's here Rob how long have you been here a couple minutes okay we got Rob here I just wanted to I don't want to I just want to say congratulations to your 800k subscribers that's a long time coming good job great job everybody loves you and uh I want to say congratulations for everybody who bought in the bar market and did their job to get to this point so I think uh we're in the right place at the right time that was it congratulations everybody did you see it come in in live Rob the um I was I was over on Tom crowns for a bit and I saw it coming live and it was it was the most anticlimactic thing I've ever seen I thought it was more climactic than watching the ball drop on New Year's Eve but please I was like that was it that was great yeah well I thought it was interesting because it's then like you know you go you immediately go look and you see what the price is doing you know um and of course wasn't doing a damn thing but no it never does anything but I mean that's what that's what we're we're here for to you know to go over the Long Haul and wait for the time and the risk band to drop like the last question that you've answered about you know are you g to get into ethereum so that's that's what I'm waiting for I think eth is probably gonna be bottoming out against Bitcoin uh maybe in two months or so we'll see yeah we'll see it's look it's been bleeding for how long two two and a half years I I this is the first I've heard you talk about it so I don't okay I'm not for sure I'm not for sure but yeah no this is good times so I uh no I just want to pop in and say that because this is we' got a lot of things to talk about over the next uh six to 12 months so yeah I mean after after Bitcoin dominance tops out we'll have to change the content that that we talk about I I don't I don't know if it's I still think 60% is low but we'll see Ian you could be right I mean it's possible it goes higher but I I think for me like 60% is like sufficient to like you know to start thinking about all Bitcoin pairs bottoming out because you also have to remember like one of the reasons why it might not go to 70% is because you have you know if you like if you look at usdt dominance plus usdc dominance um I mean that makes up six% you know and and in 2019 that dominance only made up like 1% right so I mean that's that's an extra 5% right there that that you know would theoretically have been in Bitcoin four years ago that's now not because um you can actually put it in the stable coin Market did you ever as you were going through this and and like Bitcoin dominance was was going down and not up was there a point where you're like ah maybe this isn't going to going to pan out like I thought it was I think the biggest time when I was a little uncertain was during the merge um but you know what you know what kept me motivated on it when you looked at dominance here you can see it put in a lower low um including Stables right in the going into the merge but the reason I I remained sort of steadfast on The View was because when you exclude Stables which is the whole point of dominance you know we're looking at dominance to try to figure out what it's doing against you know what altcoins are doing not what stable coins are doing dominance excluding stable coins never it was a higher low right may you know or the merge was a higher low the actual low on dominance was in May of 2021 which by the way may of 2021 is exactly when the social risk topped out right so in order for dominance to go down you have to have retail coming in if you don't have retail coming in dominance just naturally goes up you know I mean I feel like I feel like to some degree you don't need a reason for dominance to go up you need a reason for it to go down and the re and the way that it goes down is you have you know you have retail coming and and we're just we're not seeing that yet but I I I think we'll probably see it but it's just it's not here yet yeah isn't it isn't it great though when when things do work out the way that that you think they're going to work out and then you can say okay great that happened now on to the next thing that's all yeah no for sure I mean especially considering there's there's plenty of things that don't you know don't go the way we think I I don't know what you're talking about everything that I've called has been gold so when so when so when something goes the way you think it's it's always it's always nice exactly I know you've been doing pretty well on your altcoin plays here for the last few months right yeah not not too bad we and then uh I'm gonna get out of here in a bit because I gotta go pick up my I have to go pick up my wife she's at the at the the the wanis concert here in Puerto Rico but um but yeah um all coins were doing pretty good but we just did a video we took we talked about time and wristbands and we took a look at what it would be like to in the last cycle to do uh dollar cost averaging from 20 January 1st 2018 to the the having on May 11 2020 and then we took a look at what it would be if you did time and wristbands from January all the way up to uh the all-time highs in April and November and then we took a look at what it would be like if you would have done time and risk spends dollar cost averaging I should say $10 a day from uh the having of May 11 20120 into November 2021 and we took a look at it it was just it was interesting because like if you do just dollar cost averaging the best you actually would do would be just to stop as soon as you get to the having and just kind of let let let things flow as far as percentage it goes but if you would have done Dynamic DCA you would have actually like double or tripled uh your your Roi so yeah that was my big Spiel today if you can load it if you can load up your your dcas at lower wristbands then it helps right it certainly helps um I just think I think the reason why I've been so skeptical about alts is because I I just look at them as as still bleeding against Bitcoin you know um but you know there are some that have done really well I mean there's some there's no doubt about it they outperform Bitcoin um a lot but at least the larger market cap alts they just put in a new low last week you know know yeah like that's why I go back to these ideas of like you know it really hasn't made sense to DCA eth over Bitcoin or Ada over Bitcoin or dot over Bitcoin right because they all just keep on putting in new lows um but Bitcoin continues to St to to kind of take that liquidity but I mean I get it there there definitely are some altcoins that I know you've talked about that have outperform Bitcoin um by but those tend to be smaller market cap coins right they are and that and that's why like as we go into to this next this next Evolution this is this is why Ben I can't wait to talk to you about runes and layer 2 Solutions and wizard tokens I feel like you're trying to speak to me I just know it well thisen everybody I just want to pop in and say congratulations doing what you're doing Ben congratulations on your 800k I see Tom Crown is in is in the comment section you're a good com Company ladies and gentlemen congratulations we are right at the right place the right time Ben I'm taking off all right I'll see you next time see you guys all right guys um well I don't know I don't really know if I have any more any more things to add other than that um Tom says he's scheduling a stream now for 2028 I guess you can just schedule it April 17th and hope hope that it doesn't change between now and then that probably will let's see bitcoin's at 63k how did Rob dis appear wild Rob appeared oh yeah thoughts on the stock to flow model my my my my sort of thoughts on it are that it's it's it's generally going to be more optimistic than what actually happens um but it's still a decent model remember to subscribe guys if you have not yet subscribed I don't really know what else to talk about guys uh we've been going for about an hour here um and I don't know bitcoin's not really doing a whole lot right now it might I mean we might have to wait until until Monday um for uh for any of theity start I don't know it might not but wow we have 6,000 people viewing I didn't realize that how low can dominance go once it tops out um I don't know I'd probably look at this trend line and carry it all the way out till like I don't know maybe like  43% you could see something like this um it could do something like this maybe it'll do something like that you know I I I don't really know but it is possible for it to to play out like that all right guys we'll go ahead and wrap it up there I do appreciate apprciate everyone uh tuning in uh make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and also there is ITC premium uh the sale is ending this weekend I I think they're GNA take the sale down uh tomorrow uh just after the having so if you still want to get in you still have a little bit of time to lock in the low rate if you want to otherwise I will I will see you guys on the next video uh sometime theoretically probably tomorrow night but until then I will uh hope you guys have a good a good weekend and I will see you guys again next time bye",Youtube video,2024-04-19 00:00:00,"The video discusses the upcoming 2024 Bitcoin halving event, providing technical analysis and predictions on the potential market impact. The speaker believes Bitcoin dominance will continue to rise, reaching around 60% as altcoins on their Bitcoin pairs bleed further. He expects Bitcoin to chop around above its 20-week moving average, while altcoins get pinned below their support levels, before Bitcoin eventually breaks below its 20-week and the market reassesses the damage from the Fed's rate hikes.The overall sentiment is cautiously bearish in the near-term, with the speaker anticipating a boring summer for the crypto markets as Bitcoin pairs bottom out, before a potential recovery later in the year as the Fed shifts towards rate cuts. The speaker believes the current crypto market cycle is following a similar pattern to 2019, with Bitcoin dominance set to increase further before the next altcoin season.The speaker also discusses his previous predictions on the Fed's interest rate hikes, noting that he accurately forecasted the terminal rate reaching 5.5%, contrary to market expectations. He believes the Fed will pivot and cut rates sooner than expected, potentially as early as June or July, if the labor market shows signs of weakness. The speaker emphasizes that the pricing out and subsequent repricing of rate cuts can cause volatility in the markets.Additionally, the speaker provides insights on altcoin trading strategies, suggesting that investors should look for altcoins that can set a low against Bitcoin and hold that level for 3-6 months, as these are more likely to perform well in the future. He also discusses the potential trajectory of Nvidia and Tesla, drawing comparisons to past market cycles.The additional context provided does not offer any significant new information to expand the

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin the having approaches if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe crypto.com links in the description below make sure you guys check that out we're going to end the sale after the having sometime this weekend I don't know exactly when but I would go ahead and get it now if you want the subscription at the lower rate before we jump in I I would like to say thank you to everyone who is a subscriber here I like to kind of take a step back when I hit these major milestones and just say you know I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing it means the world to be at 800,000 subscribers you know when I started the channel I had no idea that it it would grow to be this big uh but here we are and I I really do appreciate everyone subscribing to the channel and I know I don't get everything right and I I do get things wrong um but I do appre appreciate you guys sticking with me uh either way so I just wanted to to acknowledge that and to say thank you to everyone for being a subscriber also the the having is is almost here and in fact by the time you watch this video the having's probably already happened um I'll try to get the video out here uh in a in a in you know 30 minutes or so um if we take a look when it's going to occur at least from when I'm recording this video it's going to be about 5 hours um but by the time you're watching this video it's probably going to be a lot less and it could already be behind us if you go look at the um at the the how many blocks it looks like we only have about 30 blocks to go so it is coming up really really soon and I I just think it's such a big event I'm going to try to live stream it that's my goal is to try to live stream the event uh it is in about again 5 hours it's going to be a little tricky cuz that's going to sort of correspond with some uh bedtime routines for my kids uh but I will try to to to live stream it if I can uh so do look out for that here in the next four or I guess by the time you're watching this video it'll be a different time but ideally I'm going to try to get get on here live by 8:30 Eastern um is my goal but again no promises so Bitcoin is is currently at at 64k we're going to keep this pretty short um because I mean you guys know my thoughts on the market but I do just want to say you know there there's a couple of different scenarios that could play out and I'm sure you've seen me talk about him a thousand times you've probably seen everyone else talk about him a thousand times the the sort of the two main short-term things so sort of the most likely outcomes in the short term are either you go straight to the 20we SMA following the habing or you get a bounce first to go just north of the 8 week moving average and then you resolve to a a lower low in May um off of off of whatever low this is you know so those are the sort of the two most likely shortterm outcomes to me again I I don't know which one will play out I I could certainly find evidence for both I will say you know with the S&P 500 at its own bull market support ban I I really do Wonder like well if if the S&P can go to it 20we SMA why can't Bitcoin you know I mean it's been a long time and with the S&P it had been really since November since it had been at its 20we SMA and now it's there once again and I wonder like you know with Bitcoin what's to keep it from going to its own 20we SMA it hasn't seen it since really mid October so if the S&P 500 can go there why can't Bitcoin in fact it's not even just the S&P if you were to look at at eth you can see it's been wicking down to its 20we moving average already you can see the riskier assets are already hitting it um if you look at at total three you can see that it's already been wicking down to its bull market support band so as you go you know further up the risk curve it's easier for those assets to hit that 20we SMA because when Bitcoin sneezes the the the altcoin market gets annihilated and you can see that I mean Bitcoin is still well above its 20we moving average in fact I mean in fact for it to go to its 20we SMA it would require about another 15 % drop from the current prices the problem with that for things like eth and and alts is that if Bitcoin were to do that then they likely go below their bull market support bands and this is exactly what we saw in 2019 right we saw eth go below its bull market support band after that local top just after eth Bitcoin broke down before Bitcoin did so that when Bitcoin bounced off of its 20we ese in the short term even didn't hold it as support eventually it bounced off of it ethusd basically just held resistance at the bull market support band so I I do think there there's some some reason to think it could play out like that you know as much as there there very well could be sort of a relief into late April early May um just keep an eye on on the 20we SME because you know the hard part with it is that you know you can look at at at prior local tops right you can look at things like 2021 and and 2019 and see that they had these rallies back up to the 8-week moving average on their first weekly close below the 8we moving average right so the first weekly close below the 8we right here in 2019 we rallied right back above the 8we and then formed a lower high in 2021 right same type of thing right go below the 8 we and then rally on back up the thing is is like we could see a weekly close below the 8we but we haven't necessarily even seen it yet also note that in 2019 after you had that rally back above the 8we it was after a 34% drop you know at this time Bitcoin has really only dropped about the same amount that it has been about 20% right I mean you know as much as it might feel like it's it's been more brutal this time that's only because the altcoin market is getting hammered but that's what alts do best in you know when Bitcoin sneezes alts get annihilated so you can see that so far this is a pretty standard drop for Bitcoin right 20% nothing too different from what we've seen um but do note that while it is 20% the the rally back to the 8we SMA in 2019 occurred after it had gone down you know closer to 30% which would actually get you near that 20we moving average so it's really hard to say and and while it is convenient of course to compare to 2019 and early 21 because you know I'm sure everyone would like that rally back up to the8 week SMA there's also other examples uh like like 20 late 2021 where you get something like this where you you know you're putting in these weekly closes where the Wicks are lower right you can see that right the Wicks are lower there as well just like they were over here um but you ended up just getting a capitulation down right so there's no guarantee right there's no guarantee with the market and I think like I I think honestly we're not going to you know next week will be sort of the decision point on on if you're going to bounce off of it or not um this week I imagine it's not going to you know we're not going to fully know I mean this you know it's already Friday anyways but yeah I I think it's just I mean it's certainly interesting because you're not only looking at at Bitcoin sort of slowly fading back in uh but you can see that a lot of other markets are as well right like the S&P is down to its bull market support band eth is down to its bull market support band or at least it has been wicking there it's not there at the current moment but it has been for the last couple of days off and on and then you have some altcoins that are below their 20we SMA already right I mean um I'm sure a lot of them are right I don't know if link is yeah link is Ada is Litecoin is not surprisingly madic is um dot is I mean a lot of them are already below their Market sport band so you can see that like the stronger assets are still above it Bitcoin is still above it right now but you know I I look at these other markets you know even the Russell the Russell is below it right so this is a great example of how the S&P is at the 20 we but the Russell is below it so you could see something happen very very similar in crypto where Bitcoin goes to its 20 we and when it does if and when it does then maybe alts go below it right that could could very well play out sometime after the having whether you get a rally to the 8we SMA or not right and again I don't know um if we're going to go to the 8 week ese next week or if it's going to be like you know a month later I could easily come up with a reason for either scenario easily easily it it's going to depend on what your bias is um so I I really I really can confidently say I don't know which one's going to play out but I will say that regardless of whether you get a relief to the 8we or not my expectation is that Bitcoin will go to the 20we moving average within the next few weeks right you know within probably either this month or next month is my guess I mean it's been a long time right I mean it seems like we're due for it in 2019 you know it it took about 25 weeks you know something like that in you know 2020 or so all the way through 2021 we fell back into it in in May in fact and that was about 32 weeks we're currently at what 26 weeks right so my guess is you know sometime in the next 6 weeks we're going to find ourselves at the bull market support band and then we'll see what's up again my guess is that if if Bitcoin sort of chops around in this range for a few months that's what should send the Bitcoin dominance to 60% right so if it goes down to the 20e Ese and then it bounces back up for a little bit to the 8we ese or vice versa goes to the a week first and then goes to the 20 week it's that chopping process that should break the altcoin market down and I mean you can see it already happening you know with eth Bitcoin which is something we've been following you know for a long time you know it's now at 0482 now it is you know talking about this sort of stuff on the the sort of the cusp of a major Bitcoin event you know there could be counter Trend rallies for this stuff but again you know my guess is that eth Bitcoin is is just sort of doing something like this after breaking down where it it sort of TR to hold on for a week but inevitably it keeps on bleeding into into the summer months where maybe it finally can potentially bottom so that is my view here going into into the having remember if there is a larger drop in the crypto verse uh following the having whether it's immediately after or whether it's delayed by a few weeks one thing to remember right one thing that I I I think you should remember is that when you measure things from the peak and you go Peak to Peak Bitcoin is ahead of schedule by a lot right it really is it can afford to give back a lot of that and still be in line with prior Cycles we've said that forever this is why I've said Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio because it's going to outperform the altcoin marketing till QE Returns the problem for alts you know I'll tell you the problem for alts is that if Bitcoin just drops back down here to get back in line with the prior Cycles just like last cycle it dropped back in line to get to get back in line with its prior cycle if Bitcoin drops here to get back in line with the last two cycles guess what alts can go back down to their lows or they can put in new lows because they're not that far off of their lows to begin with whereas Bitcoin is right you know Bitcoin is already well off its low whereas the alts a lot of them are not now some of them are but a lot of most of them are not really that far off of their low so I mean you know if you see a situation where Bitcoin just simply goes back to where it you know where it was in the last two cycles at this point that's how the altcoin market can put in you know a lot of alts can put in new lows even in the having year and we saw that happen last cycle as well and and I know there's always going to be some type of reason for it or justification or rationalization but that is just what I've seen you know cycle after cycle after cycle is that alts can get that bounce in the prehab year but inevitably as you get later on in the business cycle and we get you know as the Market is really starting to digest all those rate hikes and and the FED refusing to Pivot sufficiently that's where alts you know the order books are thin and that's where they just continue to slowly bleed uh not only on their USD pairs but also their Bitcoin Pairs and then my guess is that once you start getting multiple weekly closes by Bitcoin below its 20we moving average I think there's a good chance that at that point Bitcoin dominance has topped but between now and then I think that you're going to see it you're going to see Bitcoin USD sort of chop around in this range for a couple of months um and during that time I I think the Bitcoin dominance will go uh to 60% as eth Bitcoin goes to 003 to 04 and and all Bitcoin pairs go all the way back down from 0 42 to where they currently are down to about .25 best case scenario and that's if you want to say that they're oscillators right so back down to 0.25 or so so that is is really my view right now on the market um there are also sort of other views that you could look at that sort of revolve around if it wants to follow some of the prior you know the prior Trends with some major geopolitical events we did see Bitcoin over here you know put in some scary Wicks back in early 2022 um and then they still swept the local high after that so there is always a chance that something like that happens as well um so be ready for anything uh but I I do think that the market would greatly benefit from a a summer lull where it just kind of gets boring for a little while and all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out that's what I think would be the best case for the cryptoverse is a a summer where all Bitcoin pairs are finally allowed to bottom out because no one cares anymore you know all the hype is behind us and then then you start to see them find their true lows on their Bitcoin pairs you know for everyone who is who's laughed at the idea of the devaluation of all Bitcoin pairs they just put in a new low last week right they just put in a new new low last week so don't laugh at it I mean this is just what happened last cycle you know it's just exactly what happened and and if they do come back down here like over here then I I think there's no debating anymore that it it really is following sort of what 2019 was it's just that the reason why it was delayed until the having year was because rate Cuts occur potentially now in the having year as opposed to the preh having year like last cycle so to me it all looks like it's playing out in a very similar manner where all Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows just before rate Cuts arrive the onset of rate Cuts potentially as early as this summer should allow a Bitcoin pairs to bottom out and then a USD pairs can find whatever low they're going to find um based on how how low Bitcoin goes and then perhaps by the last rate cut uh then you start to see it go the other way the biggest Counterpoint to all these views is if it's a um you know if we just get some manic blowoff top or something this summer uh following some type of left translated cycle I mean you could have a left translated cycle where the top is is March right I mean that's what happened in the dot crash right I mean that the top was in March of the election year that's not really my base case though um but I I would say I would say that if you are to get a left translated cycle where Bitcoin just goes parabolic into all the um into all the bad news and everything then you know then that would sort of invalidate the views that I'm expressing um my base case though is that we are just simply repeating what we saw uh back over here and all Bitcoin pairs should come down as we get into this summer and and by you know maybe by June July something like that I I could see all Bitcoin pairs finally bottoming out not withstanding Maybe some future Bitcoin parabolic rally which we saw over here but that is is you know really my view on the market right now and we will see if it if it continues to pan out or not in the meantime bitcoin's at 64k um and we'll see if it if it goes to the 20we estimate in the next couple of weeks or if instead it first rallies back up to just above or just around its 8we moving average um uh first but either way I do think we are due for a test of the bullmark sport band here in the next you know month month and a half if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the crypts premium at intothe crypto.com we have tons of charts thousands of different charts for a lot of different cryptocurrencies if there's a lot of cryptocurrencies that you have that you wish I spoke about or you wish you could see the charts for those cryptocurrencies we have a lot of them on the website you know a lot of people call me a Bitcoin Maxi how many Bitcoin Maxis have website a website with thousands of charts for altcoins right so I I'm not I just I I'm I I put my maxi hat on when Bitcoin dominance is in a macro uptrend and I I don't really think you should blame me for that um but do check it out links in the description below that sale will end uh this weekend after the having so make sure you lock in the low rate between now and then and I will see you guys uh hopefully tonight for the uh for the live stream of the having which is only a few hours from now but I can't make any promises that I'll be there it's going to depend on on how some uh some of the family stuff goes but I will do my best to be there to live stream the having anyways I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-04-19 00:00:00,"The video discusses the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which is expected to occur within the next few hours. The host acknowledges reaching a major milestone of 800,000 subscribers and expresses gratitude. Regarding the market outlook, the host presents two potential short-term scenarios - either Bitcoin goes straight to the 20-week simple moving average (SMA) following the halving, or it sees a bounce to the 8-week moving average before resolving to a lower low in May. The host notes that if the S&P 500 can reach its 20-week SMA, there is no reason why Bitcoin cannot do the same, as riskier assets like Ethereum and the total crypto market index have already been testing their bull market support bands. The host suggests that a period of Bitcoin consolidation and altcoin underperformance could lead to Bitcoin dominance reaching 60%. The host believes that regardless of the short-term outcome, Bitcoin is likely to test its 20-week SMA within the next 6 weeks, which could trigger a further altcoin sell-off, as alts may put in new lows even during the halving year. The overall sentiment is cautiously bearish, with the host anticipating a period of Bitcoin consolidation and altcoin underperformance in the coming months.Summary: The video presents a cautiously bearish outlook on the crypto market, with the host expecting Bitcoin to test its 20-week SMA in the next 6 weeks, potentially leading to further altcoin sell-off and Bitcoin dominance reaching 60%.",297,"[0.012237549, 0.022064209, -0.027633667, -0.050048828, 0.012786865, -0.006187439, -0.03262329, -0.016418457, -0.02293396, 0.016921997, -0.020812988, 0.0073127747, 0.023086548, -0.028411865,

Hi, I thought you know the having is is just under a day way um so why not why not do a live stream and and then talk about it trying to post this all right um so let me see if I can pull up a having countdown here's one so 23 hours 2 minutes uh looks like it'll be on April 20th uh just after um the turn of the day right so I mean if you're on eastern time in the states then it'll obviously be on April 19th if you are you know in Europe or something it'll be or Asia it'll be April 20th so I mean it really depends on on where you are uh as opposed to the date so I guess for some of us it'll be on April 19th for other people it'll be on April 20th I tend to just measure all these things by Bitcoin by UTC time you know weekly closes by the UTC time like we're looking at it Eastern right um so I mean I think it you know just saying April 20th is probably um the way to go but I'm sure some people will say April 19th especially because that's where it will happen in the um in the in the states so let's go over to to bitcoin it's currently just below 61k um I don't really have an agenda tonight to be completely honest I just thought hey why not throw in a live stream talk a little B about crypto uh you guys know my thoughts on the market obviously I've made those very clear um you know and I I do think that that gold breaking out and eth Bitcoin breaking down does have ramifications on the market and and if you look at at what has happened to altcoins ever since eth Bitcoin broke down they just can't they can't really catch a bit against Bitcoin and they just keep keep on bleeding right they just keep on bleeding uh bitcoin's kind of staying the same so far but the altcoins kind of just keep on going lower and and this is exactly what we saw just before rate Cuts last cycle as well um and so what you would look for when you do get volatile moves by Bitcoin whether to the upside or the downside it should be fairly detrimental to the altcoin market so if Bitcoin were to you know to Rally back up to the 8we SM then I imagine it would break alts down on their Bitcoin pairs if it were to drop to the bull Mark support band and then bounce or something I imagine it would break all Bitcoin pairs down as well and so that's kind of the you know sort of the The Dilemma that that altcoins find their find themselves in at the moment um but I I also think it's important to remind ourselves that even when you're in larger Trends um there can of course be counter Trend rallies right so you know even though I'm bullish on on bitcoin dominance like I have been for like two and a half years it doesn't mean you're not going to occasionally get pullbacks along the way we did see a pretty big pullback by dominance right after the spot ETF um I'm not really convinced that we have to have a big pullback by Bitcoin dominance after the having but if it does happen just know that the trend is likely still intact uh and it's so far Bitcoin dominance has been doing a really great job of just holding 55% I mean I've actually been pleasantly surprised that it's been able to it and um I I I assume it will continue to go higher as the months um continue to sort of pass Us by but let's go through if you guys have any questions we will um talk about them and Ivan says how are you doing fine at the moment um we got a lot of comments up here yeah 24 hours to go uh no I'm not going to be doing a 24-hour stream dream uh no I I won't be able to do that um I will have uh other duties to attend to I do have four young kids um so I'm not gonna I'm not going to do a 24-hour stream but maybe if I were in college I would have so hopefully there's someone out there uh that's doing the 24hour stream but it's not GNA be me um someone says Emily says hello from Central California uh hello I was actually looking at um uh the YouTube stats recently and I was looking at let me see if I can pull this up analytics audience where is it right here it is okay so here is the let me actually go to Lifetime so if you look at my lifetime and analytics uh based on age and gender you can see that 94.4% are male only 5.5% female um and statistically most of you are between the ages of 25 to 44 so if you're a male between the ages of 25 to 44 then there's you're not alone there's a lot of other other people that are that same demographic as well but it does you know it does really make you wonder like how do you actually get more uh women in crypto right I mean I have to imagine that that one thing that would be helpful would be for all the uh the the Relentless meme coin Shilling if I think that is probably not the way to to reach a lot of a lot of people but um we'll we'll see I have received some messages about that you know I think a lot of people would just prefer like you know not the whole crazy open mouth thumbnails and all that kind of stuff but but something a little bit more um realistic but yeah I mean it's interesting um and and of course most of you are at least I guess the third of Year from the United States and about 9.5 from the UK five and a half from Australia 5.4 from Canada and 4.3% from the uh Netherlands so Netherlands is representing some there um let's go back over to bitcoin we're we're currently around 61k um someone says uh why are we dumping you know I've talked a lot about how you know I mean look guys you there could always be a a bounce after the having or something but you know there is a lot to be said in terms of um you know just kind of being ahead of where we normally are at this point in the cycle and I again I know it's not cool to point that stuff out but know we saw the same thing happened last cycle we got really far ahead and then we we basically spent 9 months cooling off to get back in l so I don't know if that's going to happen again um it probably depends on on you know monetary policy as well but just something to keep in mind right something to just like kind of keep in the back of your head that that could play out and it wouldn't necessarily mean anything um same thing happened last cycle I think that you know when you get into a period where it's essentially up only for a while um any type of move to the downside just seems like unbearable but I mean you can see where we are um at this point in the last two cycles we were still 50 to 60% below the all-time highs so um it's it's not I mean it's not that crazy diminishing returns I do think we'll have diminishing returns again this cycle um you know whether it's a left translated cycle Peak or not uh whether you get a peak in 2025 or 2024 um yeah I mean just depends on on a lot of different things and how how everything uh plays out check markets gold oil pumping hard on the war news um yeah I mean Gold's now at 2400 but I I would say I mean you know there gold has has been building up to this for a long time and and now it's broken out so yeah yes of course we're going to find reasons I mean you know back in 2022 when you had the whole like you know Russia Ukraine situation we saw gold go up and and we that's still ongoing by the way and it still came back down right um so you know I mean you have to think about that too right like that is is something to consider because um yeah I mean like if it if if we were just going down here we'd find a narrative to support it so yes I mean you can we can always say there's a reason for it but there's also been um stuff like that in the past and you know but I think you know we saw gold building up here it made sense for it to break out I've said for a long time it's going to break out and when it does it's a risk-off signal for the cryptoverse and you know that was met with a lot of uh criticism of course but here we are and gold broke out e Bitcoin broke down and the cryptoverse is is stuck in traffic on struggle Street right now uh thanks for all the content knowled J sure um someone says green candle in today April 20th my my guess there's GNA be a lot of volatility tomorrow which probably means we're not going to do anything but if I had to guess I would say there's going to be a lot of volatility tomorrow um as the having I I guess the issue is that really it would be on Saturday if it's UTC time so technically it wouldn't even be tomorrow because you know it' be on Saturday UTC but I I suspect that you know going into the having and just after the having there's going to be a lot of volatility um and you know you could make a case either way um you know you know if you look at the first if you look at other local tops and you kind of see like what happened going into them um and and by the way I mean it could be more significant than just a local top I mean I I don't want to imply that it can't be it it very well could be and I I've said before that it could very well be something like that um but you know in a lot of these times like kind of we've seen the market just sort of slowly bleed back down at these tops you got these rallies back up to the 8we SMA after getting a few week moov to the downside but in 2020 late 2021 we basically just went back down um you know pretty far in fact kind of back down to this level here which is where this base would be and that's that's pretty that's pretty far down so I really don't know I mean I really don't know which way it's going to break but um I I hopefully hopefully you have a plan you know hopefully you have a plan uh to navigate it um my my guess is whatever happens all Bitcoin pairs are going to are going to go down a lot is is what I would suspect over the next couple of months can I talk a little bit about Bitcoin duts um I mean you guys know my my thoughts I'm guessing you're being sarcastic but I I I just suspect it's going to go to 60% this summer that's my view I just think 60% is likely going to happen this summer and and I I just hope people are prepared for it um I I feel like I've done the best I can to try to prepare people I think too like at this point I've either sold you on the idea or I haven't and so it almost seems like like kind of useless to make you know keep making one hour long dominance videos it's like you either buy it or you don't right you either buy the idea or you don't and at this point you know with it being at 55% 55 and a half percent and already went to 57% you know I I do think it could top out right in the 60s not too far from here and so you have to be I have to be careful because I don't want everyone to you know finally believe it R when it actually finally hits the top I mean I this is why I've been bullish on dominance since 38% um I do think you know a good part of the move is behind us for dominance but I I still think there's a little bit more to go in it so yeah I mean we'll see we'll see what happens um in the next couple of weeks for Bitcoin uh whether it gets the move back to the 8-week estimate or not again example here where you go back up to it example here um in 2019 where where you go back up to it you above it right above it in those two cases and then an example here where you you went back up to it but it it took it a little bit longer right I mean like you know we we had a little bit of pullback and then the third candle here which is the one we're currently in was a pretty big move to the downside where it actually you know went down to that Wick right there right it went down pretty far so you know whatever happens my guess is sometime in May um you you know you or maybe June but you would get back up and it could even be like the next couple of weeks if it if it resolves like this right here but even that could still end up being May um that you go back up to the8 week but again you know if it if you get a larger move down first that move back up to the 8 week might not be as impressive because in the eight-week estimate would have come down quite a bit yeah I I know I'm not really looking at the news but I I don't really talk about the news on here but um yeah I don't know I mean I I will leave the news to you guys what's a good question to ask I don't know someone says once the Bitcoin race becomes the space race of the sah alts will a blip in the history in the history books I do think that like you can make money on alts because there is alt season like once every four years or so but I I think it is true that most alts will just bleed back to bitcoin over the longer Hall and so you are better off just kind of if you are in the altcoin market occasionally taking profits back to bitcoin just so you lock those profits in um if you're if bitcoin's sort of your unit of account right so you know if you don't really want to use the US dollar as your unit of account and you just want to treat one Bitcoin as one Bitcoin and say I don't really care what USD valuation is worth because even if it goes down it'll probably recover eventually then yeah I mean like I I I do think it makes sense to to value your portfolio in SATs and not US Dollars and I know like when you're going through your first cycle that seems insane right I mean like it seems insane but by your second cycle and your third cycle you really start to understand like why you you value your portfolio and Satoshi over over you know US dollars because it's all about preserving the Satoshi valuation of your portfolio and a lot of those all just go to zero um again like some of them won't I mean some of them will will likely you know survive obviously I think ethereum Will Will Survive but you really have to be careful I mean you do and I I know like people are like well whatever but you know you find yourself again where a lot of the alts are are not even really that far off of I mean they're just putting in new lows against Bitcoin right I mean a lot of these alts are putting in new lows against Bitcoin and so um there really wasn't a great time to be in that altcoin over the last three years right I mean like look at eth Bitcoin it's been in a downtrend since December of 2021 right I mean there hasn't really been a great period to buy eth over Bitcoin and hold it for a year you know I mean or for a couple years maybe if you cherry pick this low here you could find an instance but I mean for the most part it's just been bleeding um the same goes with with a lot of with a lot of all coins so you have to be I mean you certainly have to be careful with them someone says hello from Singapore can you talk about alt season in 2017 and monetary policy at the time well in 2017 the FED had been raising rates for a little while but the main difference is that rates were relatively low right so it's not like it was a super aggressive rate hiking cycle like we've seen this time um I mean a lot of these bull markets are basically just the market kind of like adjusting to higher interest rates and seeing if it can handle it and when it does the market goes higher and then eventually it can't and then and then the market caves but yeah I mean you had an altseason um you know over here I mean rates were really low they were only like one and a half percent so technically they were going up but they weren't really that High I mean you know the cost of capital was still relatively cheap and so that's why I mean I I I don't think it it it was as bad but once you got you know to to one and a half 2% then you can see what what ultimately happened to the crypto Market it's more like the rate of change I think than anything else this is a pretty big rate of change but um please talk about a scenario where the FED doesn't cut rates until 2025 so I do think they will cut to be clear but the market is saying only one cut in 2024 and then one cut all the way out till April of 2025 that's what the market thinks right now my suspicion as I've said is that the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in um because once and the reason if you think about it like why that would be the case if you if you see rate Cuts get priced out then businesses are starting to actually going to believe that the FED means what they say and they're going to go higher for longer if businesses believe it then they're going to change their spending you know they the type of spending they're going to cut costs they're going to lay people off right if they just think that rate cuts are just not really ever going to come anytime soon and so just the market believing that rate cuts are not coming will probably cause them to to actually come quicker um on a day like today obviously a lot of people think there's only going to be one cut this year I suspect you could get multiple Cuts this year and I think it's possible to get a cut this summer you know um so yeah I do think that it is possible even though I know the market is not really calling for a cut until um September at the current time someone says hello from Tasmania wow they going from uh California do I think salana will overtake eth uh no I don't um if you look at the sole eth valuation I mean it it it sort of looks like it's you know at the top of the range here right if it's an oscillator um so so these are these are sort of natural questions that come up about altcoins when they've rallied against eth or Bitcoin for a while is you know do you think you're going to overtake them a lot of times those questions come up at range highs right so um just the fact that you're asking that you know and I know I know I've looked at the soulle E valuation for a while here um but you have to be careful with that sort of stuff because a lot of people will think that especially when you're near the range Heights and then and then it just ends up being no different than than before someone says TLT spiked um yeah so so so bonds are a way to hedge uh certainly if you if you want to be um if you want to hedge it is in fact dubious speculation can I talk about plan B's prediction um yeah I mean I I really don't think bitcoin's going to go to 300K um I I do think eventually it will but I don't I don't think it's going to go there this cycle um I mean we we we basically had the same disagreement last cycle too I mean like I I was um more conservative he was more optimistic um but with that said you know I I also would argue that he's had a lot of great predictions a lot of things have worked out so just because I don't agree with it doesn't mean it's not going to happen I just think that you're you're you're probably not going to go to 300K that would be basically like a 5x from Peak to Peak and last cycle we only did like a three you know a three and a half X from Peak to Peak so I just I I don't think you're going to see that happen this cycle but I do think it is I think it's attainable in future Cycles um but I I don't think it's going to happen this cycle someone says they're female I got into crypto because I wanted to learn about it now as compared to when I made you with diena no I think it's great to learn about I mean I think it's great to learn about oh we got someone from Brazil someone says I think that women are by Nature more risk averse yeah I feel like a lot of times yeah like the um you'll see more guys take on a lot more risk and and you know like sometimes it works and then sometimes it really doesn't work trying to find more questions but you guys are all just saying the same thing you're talking about geopolitical stuff which I don't really want to get into um and I think the issue is that you know we always find a reason you know we always find a reason but um I mean remember I mean like eth eth saw a top before the merge a month before the merge and the reason why I've said before that we have to be careful with this one was because it was a month before the having and also um you know this FIB retracement kind of shows that would be an area that would be potentially difficult to get through and it it is proving difficult to get through right and if you look at this you know we're sort of falling below the below the 3618 the 2618 is all the way down to like 47k right I mean that that would actually be below the bull market support band um so if you were to go there it would basically be sort of a crash below the 20we SMA um I I don't know if that's going to happen or not I mean I I do suspect that Bitcoin will go below the 20we ese this year but I don't know if it's going to happen like immediately or if it's going to be like a 2019 style thing where we chop around for a few months and then go below it someone says diminished interest it's really interesting because think about this guys we are a day away from the having and the social risk is 0.1 no one cares like like no one cares and that's why I I think we're more similar to this phase before rate Cuts than we are to sort of this uptrend over here where we're putting in higher lows the social risk just put in a lower low which is more similar to what we saw back over here in kind of the 2019 phase so I think that is ultimately where we are right now in the cycle is just before those rate Cuts arrive and and people are losing interest not because they don't like crypto but it's just that they're struggling right they're struggling with uh with with with finances maybe they're worried about their job you know inflation is brutal and this is why if you look at prior Market Cycles with you know traditional markets this is why inflationary periods are just so brutal in the markets because because you know the consumer struggles with all these higher prices for everything they have less disposable income but you know I kind of just think we're in this phase right here where social interest is just really really low um and could stay that way I mean honestly it could stay that way for you know the rest of the year frankly at least through the summer but yeah I wouldn't be surprised to see it the social risk you know stay in the in this lower area for a few months maybe bounce back and forth a little bit but um I wouldn't be surprised to see that but you're right I mean the social interest is is really has really Fallen um even though the having is only one day away if you look at YouTube views for a lot of these different crypto YouTube channels um you know they were basically at two million just a month ago month and a half ago and now they're down to one million across all these different crypto YouTube channels so definitely a lot of interest has been lost in the crypto verus recently which again is why as social interest goes down Bitcoin dominance goes up right we've talked about that a lot um and you can see it right I mean here's Bitcoin dominance without Stables as social interest goes down Bitcoin dominance goes up because if if you need if you want to see altseason you need a lot of new retail investors coming into the space to frankly buy your bags right but if they're not coming into the space and there's just not a lot of interest then the altcoin market keeps on bleeding against Bitcoin when Bitcoin dominance tops out what do you chart your alts against I think it still makes sense to chart them against Bitcoin if you want to chart them against eth as well I think that makes sense I wouldn't Char them against really anything else uh not like you know not Ono I mean I think Bitcoin and E make the most amount of sense if you want to compare altcoin valuations to other altcoin valuations you can do that but I I don't think it's as relevant gold running at this particular time versus Bitcoin is undeniably about look I I think it really is what we saw like last cycle it's you know gold broke out and and when it breaks out risk assets falter was the same thing you know it's the same it's legitimately the same thing we saw last cycle and I just feel like so many people don't want to believe it because of the having but what about the merge with eth I mean everyone told me after the merge eth Bitcoin was going to go up and look it it has only gone down as we said it was likely going to do um you have to be careful you have to be careful with the narratives it's more so what are the charts saying and what the charts are saying is that gold is broken out and that eth Bitcoin is broken down and I said for years that when e Bitcoin breaks down that's when the cryptoverse will struggle because it will represent a source of liquidity drying up right and now now that you got your first weekly close below the the the range low there you can kind of see just how how much the altcoin market has struggled on their on their Bitcoin pairs someone says the Head and Shoulder Target on gold as likely is 2500 I don't know anything think about the uh the whole inverse head and should I've said before I think we should leave The Head and Shoulder stuff to shampoo companies but I think that you know 2500 is is definitely a realistic Target I wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback from there but it's one of those things where like you know you spend three years waiting for it to break out and then it breaks out and then everyone's waiting for the pullback and you just don't get one right so I I do think if there is a pullback by gold then it probably would just be a um you know an opportunity do you think it's going to go higher for several years like it's not you know when gold breaks out it doesn't just break out um and then in the move immediately it usually breaks out and and has a a pretty impressive move that that lasts for a while so my guess this is going to last for a while um you can still get pullbacks like this like happened after it broke out in 2008 um where it broke out and then it actually had a pretty massive pullback but even in that situation it was a lot quicker to recover than you know than than risk ass that's it was a hedge right it's a hedge someone says when is a good time to accumulate alts um I I I I I mean look it's up to you it's really up to you I I don't think alts Mak sense because I just think dominance of bitcoin's going to go up you know so if you want exposure to crypto I think you're better off with Bitcoin uh with that said Bitcoin risk is still relatively high right now um as I mentioned I try to be as transparent as possible uh with with Bitcoin and what I'm doing um maybe not as possible because I mean I do Focus some of that on ITC premium but if you look at the risk levels you know as you go up the risk levels I I think the idea is as I've said to dynamically DCA out because you never really know um where the Top's going to be the local top you don't know if you're going to go to the highest risk band or if you're going to top out somewhere in between so by taking some profits along the way it it tends to work out um that way you know you take some off the table in case the market nukes uh but you still have some in case you know in case the market keeps going up so far we've seen a lot of like 20 to 22% Corrections over the last year and a half or so so far this is about 18 and a half percent so a 20% correction would put it around 59k a 22% correction we put around 57k so that would be an important level to watch the reaction from because if it reacts like it normally does from that level then you would expect at least some type of relief if you don't get a reaction from that level then it might mean the market is changing remember remember it was actually when all Bitcoin pairs broke down and E Bitcoin broke down over here that Bitcoin finally got a larger correction um right now while eth Bitcoin broke down alt Bitcoin pairs haven't broken down but they can also break down very quickly we saw how much they Wicked in just a single day not too long ago so I mean you know you could find yourself tomorrow where all Bitcoin pairs are are below 04 um so it certainly is possible and I I really do hope my my my goal my focus has been to help people realize that alts are incredibly risky and and and you know Bitcoin exposure can give you exposure to the upside but if if Bitcoin drops 30 40% the altcoin market gets annihilated um and if the altcoin market doesn't get annihilated it's only because Bitcoin went up right so if you just I mean bitcoin's kind of gives you that exposure um I also think having some cash can make some sense here as I've noted especially if you dynamically DCA sold in the point 7 a point8 wristband um but you know you know I'm not asking you to like go sell everything or anything like that I just think that you know you want to make sure you manage your risk um you want to make sure you're preserving the Satoshi valuation of your portfolio and the way that you do that is by not being needy in the altcoin market when you're on the verge of rate Cuts because when the verge of rate Cuts happened last cycle we saw after eth Bitcoin broke down I put about a tweet about this and I did a whole video on it right I said last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down the altcoin market dropped like 70% now maybe this time is different but I'm just telling you that was my experience last cycle right my experience last cycle was eth Bitcoin broke down and then alts basically just slowly bled for like nine months six to nine months right if you exclude the pandemic six months right it was brutal right it was just brutal because it was like there was no end in sight it felt like it was never going to end um I mean you can see a lot of these alts are are are you know just sort of slowly leading back to bitcoin so that was kind of the sort of the purpose of all these dominance videos to help people recognize that that Bitcoin uh does provide relative safety over altcoins um and that even you know if Bitcoin were to get a big drop from here it's still well off the lows whereas the altcoin market really isn't that far off the lows you know I mean like it's really not you know in fact most of them didn't even put in new all-time highs even salana which rallied a lot didn't put in new all-time highs card is nowhere close xrp do I mean a lot of these coins are nowhere close to their all-time high so if Bitcoin gets a correction where do you think the altcoin goes right I mean it potentially goes to a lower low that's what happened last cycle I know people just blame it on on everything but we always find an excuse every cycle for why it happened um and so I I think that just kind of sticking you know with a certain strategy for me it's just been Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio and then have some cash and fixed income accounts earning interest and then use that to navigate crypto right so if you get dips you can use um you know if you get big drops back to below 04 risk or whatever your risk tolerance is my risk tolerance is 04 but if you get big drops to your risk levels that you're comfortable buying at then you have some cash you have some cash flow to take advantage of that uh but you also have Bitcoin to give you exposure to the upside I mean even even here bitcoin's up 4X off the lows how did I get the conviction for your calls in the face of haters I I think it was I mean with with with all it was just like I've seen it before like I I remember last cycle dcing altcoins like from Q3 of the bare Market year through the H through the early part of the having year and then most altcoins put in new lows in the having year and I was just like hell I could have just stuck with Bitcoin that whole time and been so much better better off you know so I was like next cycle I'm going to do it differently after the top is in I'm just going to preach the good talk about Bitcoin dominance and get people to realize that altcoins are really you know alt season only comes after we go back to you know a lot looser monetary policy and QE right that's when alt season comes back and ALT season comes back when the haters give up right that's when it comes back know you can you call It All season all you want to I don't really care what you call it but you know as far as I'm concerned you know look at the chart you know show me where alt season was over the last three years you know and in the Bitcoin dominance St show me where all season was I don't see it I mean is this is this your all season right I mean is that is that your All Season no these are all seasons right that's what you're looking for we're not there right we're not there the only way you get to all season is for dominance to go higher first right and then once it's higher and all the Deens give up then you get all season but as long as the Deens don't give up guess what they keep on spending you know like crazy and inflation is still an issue and the FED has to go higher for longer right once you break the animal spirits inflation finally comes back down the FED pivots and then Bitcoin dominance goes down but I just I don't think we're there yet right I don't I I think that Bitcoin dominance is going to go to 60% where is the 8we I think it's at like 67 um but I mean it's going to move down quickly because the the price is going down quickly so I mean like you know it's at like 66.8k right now but you know I mean because that the price of Bitcoin has moved down so much in a very short period of time you will see it sort of roll over in the coming weeks and start to back down unless we go right back up someone says they need a Bitcoin only portfolio tracker you know there there's a lot of the portfolio trackers if you look will have a little button that you can click that'll convert it from usdt or USD to to bitcoin right so there are a lot of trackers that do that you just have to maybe hit the toggle the button that has your USD valuation of your portfolio if you click it um some of them have the option to view it on on your Bitcoin valuation and some even have it so you can view it as your eth valuation um so maybe maybe the portfolio tracker that you use already has that feature and you're just not aware of it because plenty of them have the feature if you're using one that doesn't have the feature then uh I don't know what that portfolio tracker is doing but they need to start implementing it after the having what is the narrative I think the narrative after the having is just win rate Cuts is I think that's the H I think that's the narrative it's just the market screaming at the FED to give us rate Cuts is is what I would guess the next narrative is going to be fed said no maybe no rate Heights until 2025 yeah again I I I think the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in so because because the consumer gives up the you know the the businesses give up I think them saying that and the market finally believ leing higher for longer means that it's started it's it's probably time to start fading higher for longer I've been a big proponent of higher for longer forever you know I was in 2022 I said we're likely going to go five and a half percent for the terminal rate and most people were saying we weren't going to go past three and a half percent but now that we're at five and a half percent and we've been here for you know nine months or so remember the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and we're already beyond that I think that in the same way the market underestimated how High the terminal rate was going to be I think they're underestimating the number of rate Cuts we're going to get over the next year they're currently only pricing in two rate Cuts over the next year that's an issue right that's an issue and you can see what's happening markets are are rolling over and it's not just crypto you know you can see a lot of uh a lot of um equities rolling over too so you know I think it's a problem when all these rate cuts a lot of these rate Cuts get priced out and it's because they're getting priced out which my guess in not too long from now we're going to see a lot of them get priced back in so I would fade this honestly I would fade this I mean it could mean a lot of different things it could mean locking in you know certain uh fixed income type stuff it could mean getting some Hedges as I've said before like gold and and and and bonds um but I mean you know with with things like bonds I mean they can still go down if if um if we keep getting in you know hot inflation prints it's not like they have to have bottomed already it's possible they have but it's not it's not like they have to um and and also my guess is that this summer if Bitcoin dominance is at 60% I I think a lot of people will start to call for it to go much higher but if if we're getting rate Cuts uh this summer then you know might not go much higher after that right I mean what would be the that would be the perfect narrative for people to say oh well you know you're never gonna have an allseason again because of of um you know everything's just going to go into the spot ETF but I I do think what we first 60% then we talk that's kind of where I am 60% dominance then we talk someone says that's a nice white T-shirt uh this is the uh the dubious speculation t-shirt we have them in the store stored out into the cryptoverse decom I have no clue in hell why you would buy one uh but if you need a shirt you can go buy one is the cryptoverse still on discount yeah just for the next day after the having we're going to raise the prices of ITC premium so you can lock in the price between now and then if you want lower price they're going to go up quite a bit if e Bitcoin continues to fall into June as you predict well you didn't start buying alts or stay Bitcoin heavy until Qi so here's the issue with it is that alt Bitcoin pairs bottom before alt USD pairs if you have a problem with that statement look at what happened last cycle okay alt Bitcoin pairs bottom before alt USD pairs so in order to figure out when all USD pairs bottom first all all Bitcoin pairs generally have to bottom now that doesn't mean that all altcoins have to put in new lows but you know in terms of building off of a low that can then start durly outperforming Bitcoin first all Bitcoin pairs bottom then alt USD pairs bottom so I think after all Bitcoin pairs find their low then you have to wait a while after that for all USD pairs to find their low um so you know I don't you know if you convert Bitcoin to altcoins you know when Bitcoin dominance tops you might be preserving the satos valuation of your portfolio if Bitcoin dominance is topping out but then the issue could be that your USD valuation of your portfolio is going down because while all Bitcoin pairs might be going up they might be going down on their USD pairs because bitcoin's going down right so the altcoin market is really a slave to bitcoin during this phase of the cycle and that's why I've said forever right just have Bitcoin if you want exposure to crypto because you know I mean you know if Bitcoin goes up it's going to go up more than Al and if it goes down it's going to go down less than alts generally speaking some are going to break that rule but generally speaking um and as far as eth I I've said before I do think it's going to fall back through this wedge because that's exactly what it did last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down right we had this wedge and and it fell back through it as eth Bitcoin broke down and we just saw eth Bitcoin break down last week and it seems to me like you know it's falling it's potentially falling through this wedge right you can see right here it fell through the wedge after eth Bitcoin broke down here and then eth Bitcoin just broke down and it looks like ethusd is falling back through back to that wedge which is around 2200 or so um but you know my guess is that is that eus will you know will go go there this summer is my guess I mean if not sooner but I I do think that if you just look at last cycle I know everyone wants to compare this year to other having years but I'm telling you monetary policy plays a role and if you didn't believe me last year you should believe me this year because Bitcoin dominance kept going up you know most of the people that refuted the idea of monetary policy playing a big role thought the Bitcoin dominance had topped out they should go back to the drawing board now that Bitcoin dominance put in a higher high right it means they were wrong it means they were wrong so I I think it it makes sense to compare it to mon you know use monetary policy to guide the view of the uh of the cryptoverse someone says the S&P futures are under 5,000 um yeah looks like you're right it looks like we are at a that's a pretty big drop this week 40 uh 4970 how will Bitcoin cycle correspond to the S&P cycle if it is left translated um I mean I imagine if Bitcoin cycle is left translated then it probably means that the S&P is also uh topping out sooner as well um there's also a scenario where the tops already in I mean it's not necessarily you know something that I'm saying has to be the base case I think there's you know compelling reason to believe that if if the FED pivots later this year and they start printing again then we could go back up in 2025 but if they don't if they really don't cut rates until 2025 like you know one of the one of one of them said uh then you know there does exist that scenario that you have to that you have to consider right I mean you know I mean we've seen we've seen markets find local tops in election years in in in March of 2000 actually uh the S&P found a local top or a macro top for a while and um in the 70s it was in December and then in in the first in the first big inflationary cycle and then in the 1940s the uh the election near top occurred in the summer so there's a lot of different periods of high inflation um where the markets are just Manic and and inflation is running rampant where you do see some tops in in election years but also note that there is actually seasonal weakness in the S&P 500 around this time in election years right so it's not even it's not even clearcut uh if you were to look at say you know the S&P 500 um and you compare say 2024 with the average of election years I mean you can kind of see that it's actually still well above the average of where it normally is in election years right so I mean there's there's some seasonality you can see here a lot of times the S&P kind of goes below its yearly open on the average as you get out into the May time frame um or you know may to June time frame so that's pretty standard um I mean you can see just how more volatile this one has been than sort of the average if you look at 2020 obviously that was a crazy one to compare to um and I'm not asking you to you know put a lot of faith in that one but you know you can look at 2016 and see that this is this one is currently outperforming that one you can look at 2012 actually 2012 at this point was actually doing better than this year has been but you can also see that this is kind of the phase where it it it you know sort of fell back down until maybe like May June time frame uh you can look at 2008 obviously 2008 wasn't really a great year uh 2004 here's 2000 and so on and so forth do I think the Bitcoin having will slowly Drive price up I think we are really far ahead of schedule this cycle and I think we really need the market to cool off I think that would actually be really healthy if it could if it doesn't if if all the animal spirits continue to run wild then we probably um you know then you get a blowoff top that is you know uh left translated and can be really bad for the longer term um I I hope I hope the market cools off uh if like kind of like last cycle where all Bitcoin pairs have an opportunity to bottom out um but I just I don't I don't think they bottomed out yet I do think all Bitcoin pairs are going to go down do you think the Bitcoin will hit the middle or high into of the logiic aggression rainbow chart well we've already gone down two and a half log lines right I mean we already done it um so we've kind of already hit it I think we could hit it again maybe later the cycle kind of like we hit it a couple times last cycle but the two and a half log line rule has already been hit here can I explain what Bitcoin dominance is basically it's just the uh the you know the the market share of Bitcoin with respect to the entire asset class right so like if Bitcoin dominance is at 50% it means that bitcoin's market cap is half of the total market cap of the entire asset space of the entire asset class what all coins do I I haven't been buying alts I mean I I've said for a long time I I think uh you know Bitcoin makes more sense at this phase of the cycle if rate Cuts does Bitcoin go up or down it depends on why rate Cuts if you look at history there's examples where rate Cuts cause Asset Risk assets to go up and examples where risk assets go down and it's because it's why they're cutting if they're cutting to kind of get a head of any potential bad stuff then risk assets can go up in 2019 while Bitcoin went up when they cut rates um or sorry Bitcoin went down when they cut rates the S&P went up um but there are times in history where the S&P goes down when they cut rates if they're cutting rates because they get some type of really bad labor market print or something then they cut rates for the wrong you know because they waited too long and then the market goes down so it depends on why they cut there's not like a an answer that that is going to be fitting for you it's not like I can just unilaterally say that risk assets do X or Y when rate Cuts arrive it really depends on the specific situation because you can find examples of both if e Bitcoin falls into lower regression ban then ALS will fall um yeah someone says greetings from Mexico City someone from Brazil too if eth Bitcoin pair plays out as you were saying well all season come at all or it'll be a very shortlived all cycle so if it plays out like last cycle right which is a big F but if it does it means that the alt season that you're wanting is not coming this year if that if it plays out like last cycle if it doesn't play out like last cycle then maybe all maybe the alt season does come this year but if it plays out like last cycle where once rate Cuts arrive the market bleeds for like six to n months then it it means that um the market gets really boring you know and and then in 2025 maybe when everyone's given up then you get alt season um but yeah I mean I I I think it's possible that you still get alt season in terms of like Bitcoin dominance crashing but I don't think Bitcoin dominance is going to crash until you get until you see it at least at 60% and even then it's probably gota kind of move around you know from 60 to 61 or to 58 right it's got to bounce around for some months there before you see it come back down anyways oh I got someone from Africa how many to reach 800,000 subscribers that's a good question um let me go check I'm at 799,000 1857 subscribers so if 143 of you could hit that subscribe button I will be at 800,000 subscribers I would very much appreciate it uh if you could subscribe if you're not already Subs got someone from Argentina um so glad you finally can to out of Al in 2023 I was a late yeah no I mean look some alts did okay it's not like all alts have been terrible but most of them have just bled to bitcoin right and you know I think that the the the collapse of eth Bitcoin is a really bad element for the altcoin market and I know it's easy to make fun of me for it and say you know you don't know what you're talking about but it's just what happened last cycle I I don't have to be right about it I could be wrong but it's just sort of a fair warning last cycle when e Bitcoin broke alts dropped 70% right that's what happened I didn't control it right that's just what happened um so I don't know like I don't know if they're going to do the same thing but I'm not putting my money I'm not risking my money on alts if you know during during during a do during a Bitcoin dominance rally uh you're free to risk your money on alts if you want to but I'm not going to risk my money on them um I've also missed out on some pretty cool gains in the altcoin market that's a fact too you know there's definitely some altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin um let's be real right I'm not trying to pretend like you know you know it was the perfect idea not to have any alls but I mean I'm just saying for me real relatively risk averse if you see a Bitcoin dominance rally coming from a mile away which is what I thought I saw and I was right like why would I go put a lot of money in alts if I just think Bitcoin dominance is going to go up right um just ride that Bitcoin dominance wave you know let the altcoin market bleed to bitcoin and then your purchasing power to buy Alt with Bitcoin goes up right even if Bitcoin goes back down like think about it like think about it like this today let's go maybe this is a great a good way to explain it so today if you look at one over eth Bitcoin one Bitcoin will get you about 21 eth right in in MA in in um December 2021 when Bitcoin got you about 11 e right if you had if you bought Bitcoin at the top in 2021 and R and rode through the highs and the lows the your USD valuation is essentially the same but guess what you can now buy twice as much eth with the Bitcoin that you have that's why Bitcoin dominance matters is because you took on less risk to hold a safer asset Bitcoin and now you can buy an altcoin for a lot cheaper and if Bitcoin were to go down to 50K or 40K even you know even if it goes lower right 30k in 2019 it first went to the 100 we SMA when rate Cuts arrived right I mean so I mean if it if it does that it could it could take a long time for us to get there but that's where it ultimately went you know I mean it went to the 100 we moving average um right now that 100 we SMA it happens to actually correspond to that breakout point right I mean it's kind of uh coincidental but that's actually what it corresponds to so you know if you get a situation where Bitcoin crashes Bitcoin dominance likely still goes up and so then like you might be upset that your Bitcoin USD valuation is down but then maybe your Bitcoin will then fetch you 30 e right you see what I'm saying it it really depend it comes back to whether you believe in the future of the cryptoverse right if you believe in the future your of the cryptoverse then you know for satoshi's sake value your portfolio in satoshi's if you don't believe in the future of the cryptoverse then fine value your portfolio in USD but don't come crying to me if your altcoin bleeds 90% against Bitcoin over the next 10 years or probably more the satos evaluation is what is important and you know it is you can laugh we but it is that that is what matters is sat valuation it shows you just how easy it is and it's not just you know look at look at Ada Bitcoin you know look at look at one over Ada Bitcoin in 2021 one Bitcoin would get you about 15,000 Ada today it gets you 141,000 Ada all you had to do was stick with Bitcoin once the FED made it clear they were going to be raising rates and going to quantitative tightening you didn't have to have any clue where the USD valuation is going to go by the way none of us have a clue you didn't have to have any clue where the USD valuation of Bitcoin is going to go all you had to say was look we're going into a high interest trade environment the fed's going to be reducing the size of their balance sheet Bitcoin is a safer asset there's going to be a hell of a lot of Regulation risk coming for the altcoin market so I'm just going to ride that Bitcoin dominance wave convert all to bitcoin and wait until the FED pivots that's all you had to do and then one Bitcoin over here got you 16 you know 14,000 or sorry 16,000 Ada today it gets you 141,000 Ada and I don't know I mean I don't know which alt coins are going to become relics but guess what if you held Ada all the way down then you're sure as hell invested and you hope it goes back to a new alltime high if you just converted your altcoins to Bitcoin in early 2022 when I said was the time to do it you have the luxury to just kind of come in at some point in the future and just kind of scoop up whatever altcoins you want at much cheaper Bitcoin valuations right that's why I say don't marry an altcoin right don't marry an altcoin there's only one year of the cycle where it really makes sense to to to to be heavier really heavy into alts there's really like one year of the cycle where that that makes sense you you spend one year Watching Bitcoin dominance go down and then then you spend like three years watching it go up right it's not that complicated guys it's really not in fact look at this chart if this chart I was looking at this earlier it should convince you well maybe not it's dubious but look at this chart six-month East Bitcoin candle right look at this and tell me tell me everyone on here is not just over complicating the Everlasting you know what out of it green red green red red red green red green red red red you know I mean what's so hard about that right this is what happened last cycle I don't know why people thought this time was different it's possible that eth Bitcoin Bottoms in Q2 or Q3 I said before it might bottom in June that's kind of like my base case right now is that it Bottoms in June but that's going to be predicated on the idea that the FED pivots this summer If the Fed doesn't pivot this summer I think they're making a bad a really bad mistake honestly and you know I do think there's a good chance we get a hard Landing but if they don't pivot this summer I I think a hard Landing is probably locked in um because the the consumer is is starting to falter here um just because you have some residual inflation based on lagging data uh it doesn't mean I mean it doesn't mean that the consumer is healthy right but I mean look at that look at the E Bitcoin six-month candles red green red or green red green red red red same thing green red green red red red I mean it's the same exact thing for anyone who cared to look at the damn chart you know but instead I spent the last two and a half years listening to the eth Maxis tell me how it was holding up well every step of the way down and now some of them are starting to capitulate and I'm telling you I'm telling you some of them I think are going to be capitulating into that 0.3 to 0.4 range and that could be the bottom right when they say all right Ben you were right like all right well now that you believe me it's time to go back the other way so you have to you have to be careful with this stuff it's playing out like like it played out last cycle for anyone who actually cares to look at the chart and and and they don't come on here here and tell me that you know I'm ignoring all these higher lows on the E Bitcoin pair because I'm not you know I'm not I I recognize there's higher lows on here but you know what else I recognize I recognize lower highs you know so don't don't just look at at at one of the charts look at all of them right I mean you can see that like however you want to draw this out there e Bitcoin is breaking down you know um and you have to be careful when that stuff happens and I mean you know I think it I think it's going to accelerate the breakdown into the summer months and then hopefully bottom out this summer just like it did on the similar time frame in the last cycle when you looked at those six-month candles someone says chain link early M last cycle the issue with chain link you know I I with the Bitcoin valuation look to see what it does here you know I drew this potentially out um a while back you know when it was back up here look to see if it holds here at um at 17700 STS that prior low sort of that back testing that that trend line if it can hold there then maybe you have something right if it can't then you're just it's a falling knife right see if it holds support I don't know if it's going to hold support a lot of these Els aren't holding support like Ada Bitcoin sure is H holding support dot Bitcoin I mean what is there to say right Litecoin Bitcoin as I said before what it does best is bleed against Bitcoin or Litecoin bleeds against it link Bitcoin just said madic Bitcoin I I think I think there's a good chance that madic Bitcoin will will bottom before eth Bitcoin um so if you see madic Bitcoin bottoming then it might mean eth is gonna bottom against Bitcoin but I don't there's not really a clear evidence yet that it's bottomed um I've said forever that once madic gets below a thousand stats you got to be on the lookout for it and it's already gone below a thousand so as it continues to bleed here look to see if it can form a low right that doesn't mean the USD valuation is done bleeding even when the madic Bitcoin low is in the madic USD valuation can go down after madic Bitcoin bottoms same thing for eth Bitcoin and ethusd and Ada Bitcoin and Ada USD and Bitcoin and USD right it's the same thing but either way I mean look you have two scenarios here right I mean the markets don't tend to go sideways for very long so it's either going to go up or it's going to go down my contention my contention is that if it goes up all Bitcoin Get Wrecked if it goes down all Bitcoin pairs Get Wrecked so Bitcoin dominance goes up no matter what right so that's why I've said you know rinse your hands of the altcoin market until lose for monetary policy AR that's been my view um admittedly whenever I whenever I get super vocal about it uh you know inevitably someone does it and then and then we get a bounce and they hate me for three months but um it's been my V for two and a half years you know if if it took you until now to to get on board with dominance train that's not my fault what's my long-term stance on E Bitcoin I don't really know I'd like to see if it can bottom at 03 to 04 someone says interesting that dominance isn't spiking as hard as a few days ago as when we hit 60k there's an interesting dominance chart and that's like dominance excluding Stables um and it's actually kind of doing what it did LA I mean it it it did something similar last cycle where it sort of swept the high and then cooled off for a little bit and then kept moving up I think it's going to move up it might it might cool off for a week or two but I I do think you know in May and June you should see the dominance a lot higher um especially you know especially as we get further out into the summer right like May June maybe even out to July I don't know I think the hard part is the dominance rally has taken a lot longer than I thought it was going to so I don't really want to limit it to May or June like it could rally until August or September for all I know um but I mean it it it really depends on on just how quickly it it takes things to you know to to to play out you know and I I don't know um if if if for instance right I mean like like like let's suppose if e Bitcoin bounces after the having like it bounced after the spot ETF right you see after the spot ETF e Bitcoin got a bounce if it gets another bounce then I mean it essentially delays everything by like a month or two you know um so it kind of depends like I don't know if it's going to get that bounce after after the having um you can see that last cycle we we did get sort of a similar type of Bounce but eth Bitcoin hadn't actually broken the range lows on a weekly close whereas here it already has so you know I don't know you got s your one two three um one two three you can kind of see it's already breaking so I don't know if it's going to get that bounce at all anyways and the last time it didn't get a bounce um it didn't get that final bounce right it just broke through so there's definitely like evidence to suggest that it could go it could get a bounce but my base case is that is that um e Bitcoin bleeds you know my base case is I don't I'm not going to bother trying to predict every single low or high by the E Bitcoin pair I'm just going to say look I think it's going to go down if it goes up in a twoe time frame or something so what that doesn't change anything for me it doesn't move the needle um just like all these other lower highs didn't move the needle for me someone says you all expect a balance from 58 I don't know where did it go um how low did it go I mean it just went to 59 six um so I mean that so what is that what is that measured from the top so that's about a 19 so we've now gone 19% down a lot of those pullbacks before were about 20 to 22% so it's getting pretty close to that typical pullback if it's more than a 22% drop if it's like a 25 or 30% drop then you could still get a sizable rally off of that like 2019 but it it probably is even more definitive evidence that the local top is in right because that's what happened in 2019 is after e Bitcoin broke down um you finally had a 30% drop as opposed to just like a 10 to 15% drop um so if you get a larger drop then it you could still get a balance off of that level but it probably is kind of some evidence that whatever comes after is a lower high if you bounce it 20 to 22% down there's still a chance right there's still a chance that you know you could see another move up but even in that case you still have to watch that 8we moving average because that 8we SMA is is potentially we're potentially going to get a weekly close below it um and we've we've I mean I shouldn't have to explain why that's important we've talked about it for the last year uh but you know when that happens it can certainly mean the market is cooling off and and you can see that it really cooled off over here last summer as well as it went below the eight-week moving average same thing in 2021 both Peaks same thing in 2019 right once you get that Weekly close below the eight-week estima it doesn't mean you can't get another face ripping rally back up to a lower high but it does tend to mean that the party's going to be over um for at least a little while for someone who has a higher risk tolerance you think D saying Al now a bad play I think it makes sense to do what you're comfortable with I mean like I I don't think that like what I'm doing makes sense for everyone um I think it kind of depends on where you are in your own Journey you know I mean if you want to take on more risk who am I to tell you not to do it you know I mean there's been plenty of people that took on risk and made a lot of money so I I think you have to remember like what's right for me is not what's right for you do I see Bitcoin hitting higher highs before a summer slump um that's a good question I don't really know I mean you know with the spot ETF we you know the market wasn't really looking that great and then it it just spiked up and put in a new high right so like you know and then and then it and then it real you know radically sold off after it now of course we ended up going up a lot higher but um it it's really hard to say I mean I think that we're probably going to get to the point where you know everyone's gonna think at least that it's going to go to a new High um especially if you get some type of like rally like that off back up above the 8we estim like we saw in 2019 and 2021 I don't know I mean I I do think there is a case to be made the closer you get to May and stuff that um you're GNA see that summer lle come into play I'm not going to say it can't go put in a new High I mean I mean look at the wick into the spot ETF right look at that Wick right I mean if we replicate that then you know it's essentially a new high but I mean it's risky right it's risky to sort of bet stuff on that again I don't I don't base my investment strategy on whether I think Bitcoin is going to Wick back up to the highs or not like that's not something that I even care about um I don't really know I mean I I do think there there is some reasons to think that with eth Bitcoin breaking down and gold breaking out that it could turn into into something more but um that something more could still be one or two months away right where it you know like over here it after it fell below the 8 week and then still rallied back up for a few weeks and then it fell um in 2019 after it fell below the 8 week you know it still it still rallied back up for a few weeks and then it it still and then it finally fell it took a while right I mean it took a while and and you might get something like that right where it just takes a while if it plays out like late 2021 that would probably be the most brutal way uh to you know to potentially put in a local top is to just not even really get a relief rally and just kind of go straight back down um right after the Bitcoin having that would probably the most brutal way if that happens look to see what happens to all coin pairs under such an environment you can see that Bitcoin is is going down today it's down about three and a half% and dominance is up right I mean this is what I we've talked about forever right you know you get into the phase of the cycle where Bitcoin goes down and Bitcoin dominance goes up Jessica ask is it having the 19th or the 20th it depends on where you live um you know in the uh in the states it looks like it's going to be the 19th but if you're in Europe or something you know like UTC time you can see it's potentially going to be the 20th so if like you're in Europe or Asia or something it's going to be the 19th if you're in the states it's going to be the uh or sorry if you're in Europe or Asia it's going to be the 20th if you're in the states uh it's going to be or you know just on North America South America right it's going to be um uh April April 19th so it depends on where you live again guys make sure you subscribe if you're not subscribed uh we have I'm trying to get to 800,000 subscribers so it would in fact be nice to get there if you would not mind subscribing we actually just gained some so we are now at 799,000 so I just need 96 more people um so yeah um if you could subscribe that'd be great and also we do have the sale on ITC premium links in the description below that's going to end after the having so just fair warning um any other things should we wrap it up What If the Fed raises rates this year I don't really think they're going to raise rates I mean if they do I think that would be a really bad mistake I I don't think they're going too um but yeah if they raise rates it probably just makes Bitcoin dominance go even higher you know frankly um I don't think they're going to raise rates but yeah that's what it would mean could a rising alt pair on its total three valuation or could alt total three pairs on dayl an indication of future strength yeah if you if you're seeing an altcoin kind of like outperforming most other altcoins then it's probably an indication of future strength there's a good chance it is not necessarily but I mean like not set in stone but like I've seen that happen a lot of times where if an altcoin is showing relative strength in a dump then whenever you know whatever there's the next relief rally then it can it can outperform a lot of other alts in a in a pump huh how do I keep my ego in check after being right for so long guys the reality is that I have I mean I haven't been right about everything there's been so many things I get wrong and that's how I keep my ego in check is because the markets humble everyone um you know yes some some things I've been right about but also a lot of things I've been wrong about and and you know when you get things wrong it humbles you and um and the market humbles us all someone says they unsubbed and subbed again just for me I I appreciate that looking back should fed of raise rates a few I don't think so I think they're doing what they need to do I don't know if I'm going to go live in 20 hours I don't know I don't know I do think there's going to be a lot of volatility though I think it's going to be uh kind of crazy it might not be tomorrow because technically UTC time it's the it'll be the next day but you're probably going to see a lot of volatility going into the having so just be aware of that um yeah what does the extension from the 20we look like it's kind of funny I uh I put out a video about it um and it ended up doing the same thing that it always does and everyone over complicated it once again um which is kind of fascinating right it really is fascinating how like every single time it just does the same thing it always does you know um and every time no one wants to believe it right again the trend this trend line will eventually Break um because otherwise it just implies that Bitcoin will only ever go below its 20 week SMA and never get back above it um if it if you carry it out far enough So eventually this trend line will break but it hasn't broken yet and um I mean I do think it will break but not yet it hasn't broken yet is it just a coincidence that ta allines with macros current War scare I I think we find reasons for things um I think we we like to blame we like to like rationalize why things are happening that's my guess because like if imagine this like imagine if you had this like War thing you know like the whatever you know the current scare going on right now and if the markets were up 10% then everyone would just say oh they're up because it means that it means that we're going to start printing money to fight the war you know but if we're down then people are like oh it's down because you know everyone's scared because of the war right I mean whatever happen s you can find a narrative to to support that view right so like if tomorrow the price is up then people will say oh price is up on fears that the war is happening therefore the money you know people are the the central banks are going to start printing again um if the markets are down it'll just be markets tumble on you know worries about tensions across seats you know so I mean it it it it really does feel like we look for the reason to explain the price but really price leads the narrative The Narrative doesn't lead the price whatever the price does we'll figure out the narrative to go along with it um not the other way around um also the other thing too is once you hear about the news it's already been priced in because you know I know we all think we're special but you know there's there's going to be other people that get the news before we do and algorithms that can you know price that stuff in way before we can so by the time you see it it's already been priced in theoretically you know it's not like it's not like you're going to go read the news on some news outlet and then be able to like get an edge generally speaking right because if if you're reading it on a news Outlet then s have millions of other people so what Edge would you have actually after some of the last tensions and didn't we get a bounce where we swept the high in um in 2022 I think we did I mean it wasn't like we didn't sweep the the actual top but we swept that local high I think um because the uh Iran invaded Ukraine like right here right and you had a a long Wick down and and then the market rallied back up and it actually swept the highs so yeah I mean like it's certainly possible that something like that could happen I I'm not going to say it can't happen um I mean I don't know if this is exactly the same pattern or not yeah like if you take this and you just sort of overlay it to this one right I mean you can kind of see that the market ch around in this range and then It ultimately it kind of looks like it's deviating some though because it was like following it it bounced up it was following it and then and then the market rallied but then this time the market has kept going down but maybe because it's the whole retaliation stuff that hadn't been priced in yet um but I mean you can see that it it did go back up sweep the high right it swept the high and then it got a a a big pullback so imagine how hard that would be for Market participants if you go up and and you sweep the high and then you drop into the summer right and that's why I think it makes sense to just have a strategy either way I mean like try not to stress so much about it um just have a strategy and and and I I wouldn't like try to over complicate it I mean because you also might not get that I mean you might not see that same type of move and it could also be dependent on other things I mean like you know if if in May the unemployment rate comes in at 4% or something then you know maybe the markets go down right because they're like oh crap the labor market sucks now um but if you get a Lower Print at like 3.7 or something then maybe the market rallies back um and people use that as the reason someone says they're 90% down on their mcoins back I am sad to hear that uh if you're if you're telling the truth and hopefully you can maybe stay away from the mcoin market and focus on other things someone says if you're chasing new Cycles you will always lose I would agree with that I I think that yeah like the news isn't going to give you an edge on in the markets oh did I say Iran I meant um I me Russia yeah I'm thinking about the uh the current conflict and and and um and the and the one that's you know happened that sort of kicked off in 2022 so yeah I meant I meant um me Russia see I don't know we'll see we'll see if it uh what happens here if it sweeps the low and then if it if it moves back up up into the having or or what is the bmark support B8 WEA valid for total market cap chart I I imagine it would be something similar um I think it would be something similar so the 8we for total Market is at 2.43 trillion so for us to get a rally back up there it would from this level it would be about a 12% rally to get back up to the 8we estimate for total Market am I up to dat on the candidates tournament yeah there's a tie for first place with like what two games to go all right guys I think we're going to wrap it up uh thank you guys for tuning

several key topics related to the cryptocurrency market. The speaker expresses a bearish sentiment, noting that the altcoin market has struggled significantly against Bitcoin. They highlight the potential for Bitcoin dominance to continue increasing, potentially reaching 60% or higher, at the expense of altcoins.The speaker discusses the potential impact of rising interest rates and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy on the crypto market. They suggest that the narrative after the Bitcoin halving event may shift towards the market screaming at the Fed to give us rate cuts. The speaker believes that if the Fed maintains a higher-for-longer stance on interest rates, it could lead to a pricing back in of rate cuts, which could be a positive catalyst for the market.Regarding altcoins, the speaker cautions that the altcoin market is heavily reliant on Bitcoin's performance and that altcoin pairs often bottom before their USD pairs. They suggest that investors should be cautious about converting Bitcoin to altcoins, as the altcoin market may continue to bleed against Bitcoin during this phase of the cycle. The speaker provides historical examples, such as the performance of ADA/BTC and LINK/BTC, to illustrate the potential risks of holding altcoins during periods of Bitcoin dominance.The speaker also touches on the potential for a cooling-off period in the crypto market, similar to the previous cycle, and the importance of managing risk and preserving the Satoshi valuation of one's portfolio. They recommend a Bitcoin-heavy strategy with some cash and fixed-income exposure to navigate the current market conditions.Overall, the main message is that the crypto market may face challenges in the near future, with Bitcoin dominance likely to continue increasing at the expense of altcoins, and the potential for a more prolonged cooling-off period before the next altcoin season. The speaker emphasizes the importance of focusing on Satoshi valuation rather than USD valuation, as this can help investors better navigate the market dynamics.",388,"[0.004085541, 0.01939392,

Hi, this is NFA live this should be a relatively exciting show for two reasons first of all we have the Bitcoin having coming up in just about a day and we also have a new guest with us today Max from because Bitcoin uh how you doing great thanks so much for having me Ben yeah and you started you started doing this a year or two ago is that right yeah probably about 18 months ago officially yep all right yeah so max is um I've known him basically since probably before he even started the YouTube channel or right around the time that he started it uh so make sure you guys go subscribe to him and Rob as well uh links to that are in the description below so make sure you guys check that out and we're just going to go through a lot of the different questions that I think would probably be on people's minds as we go into the having uh so let's just go ahead and jump in Rob we'll start with you on this one the having is tomorrow it's tomorrow we've been waiting forever here it is fourth having um and I'm guessing it's going to garnish some attention should be making some headlines different places I'm curious what what effects do you think the having will have on the larger crypto space um do you think it'll bring new eyes to the scene or are we still kind of just uh you know the same old same old people just kind of hanging out um do you think it'll it'll actually bring new new people to the space uh we saw a lot of new people come to the space last cycle sometime after the having um or do you think it'll be quiet for a while and do you see any narrative shifts after the Havoc that's a pretty loaded question first of all I would just like to say that Max has a great background I'm sure he got to the same place I did which is fivr and uh hopefully he didn't get ripped off but it looks great and uh I gotta tell you one of these days max we're gonna have to put that into an nft just me and you so yeah yes that is my old green screen but I'll be jumping in that green screen as soon as the uh as the Bitcoin hits 100K But to answer Ben's question which I think is is what uh everybody wants to really try to figure out is this Bitcoin having and I know like there's a lot of first of all that I still believe in the fouryear cycle some people say that it doesn't really register I still and some people will talk like Bob Lucas will say well it's just left translated and we're going to see a big blowoff top in 2024 which could very well happen but I still think that the narrative around it and there's still a lot of people say well there's Mass adoption coming and it's already here I still think it's I mean I don't think that we're at the same level like we should be and what we could be in like 2028 or 2032 or you know time comes up but Ben if you get to show my my screen real quick because everyone wants to know like well the Bitcoin having and you did a great I I watched your your video Ben about uh uh the ethereum evaluation ethereum ethereum valuation of Bitcoin about how you know Bitcoin dominance is going up and how it's wreaking havoc and it's true it is right now I know people will will also talk about you know like hey well you know these things happen leading up to the having but if we take a look back this is from Smart Valor it's a good website and if we take a look they did all the work for him which is great this is how Bitcoin behav in the year leading up to each having because we had one of course in 2012 2016 then 2020 and I know people will say well there's always a dip there's always this massive dip before the having and there could be I mean we saw one pretty massive one in 2020 but of course there's a reason for that and and we could either say like it's because of the of the almighty Corona virus or it was something else but yeah there was a dip in 2016 but again just take a look at this so with having with the having one in 2012 the year leading up to the having it went up to 385 per. and the year after of course because we always see alltime highs the year after so far it went up 5,000% having two in 2016 leading up to it 142% now there's dips along the way and we're seeing that right now but then a year after that in 2017 2 84% in 2020 even though there was a turbulent year like we talked about it was still up 17% for the year getting into that having in May I think it was May 12 2020 and then it went up almost five almost 600% the year after that and we can see here that that yeah same thing happened the year leading up to to the having on November 208th 2012 this is what Bitcoin was 250 and then of course we come up and then you can see right here that yes there is a a drop before that and then it comes up and there's a drop before but it's like the same thing as like a bull market so we're seeing the same thing kind of Replay I know it's a funny thing because like Ben you'll say like uh you say hey I I I told you that the Bitcoin ethereum evaluation was going to start to start to lose momentum or actually bleed away to ethereum and then people were going to blame a Black Swan event and they never would have saw it coming but here we are and again same thing happens here 2015 a year going into it yes it's not a straight line but we kind of I mean really rallied into it there's you know dips along the way but I mean it's going in that right direction and then of course 2019 to 2020 we started at 7325 we had it kind of flat and then we saw the almighty Corona virus right here but then we rallied into it so I still feel like the same thing's gonna Happ happen that's just how I see things and I'm I'm feeling pretty good about this having so far but the big question is and and we we'll talk about this later is what's the macro is there going to be quantitative easing or more quantitative Tiding are they actually going to cut rates are we going to have the liquidity that we absolutely need which we had beforehand even though we're in quantitative uh tightening right now I mean we still rallied pretty well but can we get that liquidity back in the market and that's I think that's the big question on top of the fact of are we going to see World War II so yeah that's where I got yeah it's interesting because you know at some point you would think we would need to make the shift from quantitative tightening to quantity to quantitative easing but what needs to trigger that shift is the is the is the thing that I I think we're kind of wrestling with um someone asked where a guy was I I should have mentioned that he's he's in Dubai and I mean there's obviously a lot of stuff going on right there going on right now there with the conference and um everything so he wasn't able to make it this week um so um Max I I'll put the same question to you I mean like what are your thoughts here on the Bitcoin having um is this just kind of the same old thing that we've seen before and everyone's trying to over complicate it uh do you see any kind of shifts coming after after the having what are your thoughts yeah I I would agree with the with the last part I think that a majority of people and it's very easy to do this I I tend to do it all the time is to sort of chronically over complicate something that has for over a decade now been a pretty reliable uh we'll just we'll call it a risk on event and in the simplest of terms all you need to do is you know pull up your trading view chart and Mark out every single Bitcoin having right you need at this point you know you need to draw four vertical lines whenever a Bitcoin having has occurred look at the the price action that has basically come almost immediately following so um you know I I try to look at this thing from Every Which angle you know I look at it from the side I look at it up side down I you know I try to include the macro and and fed policy in all of my decisionmaking but um you know the truth of the matter is this is a very unique time to be in the markets right Bitcoin is now on the global stage in my opinion for the first time um there is you know new on-ramps into crypto you know specifically being these you know nine ETFs um and it is you know there's more regulatory Clarity the accounting standards have shift did in a positive light and are working to you know become more friendly for corporations and big money to actually onboard into this digital commodity if they choose to do so um but again like Rob had mentioned and Ben like you commented on there also are some macro headwinds which can only be ignored for so long unfortunately I am of the belief that we do still have some time I believe we're maybe on borrowed time some people probably don't like to hear that but but I do believe that there is this this unique pocket of time where it's all coming together and we can really see risk perform um positively of course I don't have to tell you guys this and I probably don't have to tell the audience this but historically during a Fed pause until something has quote unquote kind of broken and we see Unemployment uh you know trending above 4% and the FED actually has to step in and begin easing through you know interest rate cuts and other measures um we can actually see risk you know being stocks and now crypto performed tremendously well and you know going back to you know to the last cycle you know we actually kind of went through a little mini fed cycle here and you know 2018 2019 and 2020 um you know where Bitcoin actually the floor kind of gave out we dropped to about 3K and then we had that famous rally into June of 2019 when we topped um you know there was actually hikes going into that and then of course right as Bitcoin basically topped in June of 2019 the FED began to actually cut rates um more or less right after that and it did dramatically affect Bitcoin some will say you know it was a reflexivity and you know we had to you know we we sprung hard off of that local floor so you know of course the market corrects to the downside some will say it's covid some will say it was in the charts the whole time some will say it's not I don't know you know nobody knows whether it would have happened with Co or or without um but again I don't think that this time really is that much different I think that every cycle has some distinct differences from from a previous one I mean for example last cycle we had a double top we haven't had a true double top before we have had a cycle like the 2013 one where we had you know two pronounced Peaks but a true double top had never happened before and additionally in the bare Market we had never spent as much time below the 200 WEA as we just did coming out of this most recent bear so there are you know of course Very recognizable and notable differences of every cycle but you to answer the question Point Blank I don't think that this time is much different and I I'm trying my best to not overthink it um and say you know what there is no reason for the FED to intervene at this point we're trending in that direction and we are on borrowed time there is a Day of Reckoning coming but I do believe at the earliest it's probably sometime in Q4 we have the having you know in less than two days and I do believe that there's plenty of room for risk to run in the short to Middle term maybe going out six months okay yeah no I mean it's great to get you guys opinions um and the market has been on an absolute tear I mean essentially after since October right I mean it was pretty boring summer last year but then since October uh the market has basically just been up only up until the last few weeks but um you know the next thing I'd like to talk about is of course Rob's absolutely favorite topic and it's of course Bitcoin dominance um and you know I you know you guys know My Views but I always like to get other other views because you know I'm I it's it's a good idea not to live in an echo chamber so Bitcoin dominance has once again broken a new highs I I we saw 57% actually it came really really quickly really quickly you know that that move to 57% it's kind of cooled off back you know it's back down to like the 55 like 55 and a half or so so it has cooled off quite a bit since that rally up to 57% uh so uh Max I'll start with you first on this one do you think it's going to keep going up after the having um you know it was it it was going up into the spot ETF and then it kind of waned a little bit following the spot ETF but then it just kind of picked right back up so what do you think is gonna happen this time and and this kind of goes to the whole like the last question as well like will there be a narrative shift and what people are focused on will they will they start focusing on more things besides you know sticking with Bitcoin um do you see you know what are your thoughts on that Max well first I have to give you a compliment Ben because you were one of the few people that with a big following publicly called Bitcoin dominance rallying to this point I didn't expect it to get up to I think it topped at what 57 recently or wherever did you you deserve a lot of credit for that well I'm known for riding Trends too long see well we'll see right nobody knows besides the market right like you know we we all have our our inclinations but uh you deserve a lot of credit because I remember months and months AG I don't it was probably six months ago plus we did a space together or you came on on my my channel because Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance was significantly lower and eth BTC was significantly higher and much has changed since then so kudos to you where do I think it goes from here so I think that Bitcoin dominance is in the process of we'll call it distribution okay I believe believe that the meat of the move is over um but that does not preclude it from going a little bit higher than here maybe maybe 60% that's not my base case but you know let's let's look left on the chart and you know use that to you know maybe forecast what could happen next so ignoring the you know whether this is a left translated cycle or an expedited cycle let's look at it contextually for where Bitcoin is at um you know from from a a p perspective right so Bitcoin actually has gone on to get above the previous cycle all-time high of 69k so most comparably again ignoring everything else but just pure levels on the chart pure you know where was the cycle High where was the cycle low you could probably compare Bitcoin right now to like December of 2020 okay if we just ignore everything else and say okay Bitcoin in December of 2020 went on to sweep the previous cycle all-time high of 197 it paused there for what maybe a month or or something like that it was chopping around altcoins got destroyed during that time right Bitcoin uncertainty like you always preach Ben uh when Bitcoin is uncertain alts get absolutely eviscerated and we are seeing that once again right so um again comparing this period of time to December of 2020 there is turbulence under the previous cycle all-time high which is not uncommon we saw that again last cycle and then also two cycles ago it seems to be sort of the same thing happening again what did we see in December of 2020 well what we saw was Bitcoin dominance basically put in a deviation or bull trap High where on when Bitcoin finally decided it was time to push through with conviction above the previous cycle all-time high of 197 you saw Bitcoin dominance put in an explosive move which ultimately ended up being sort of a bull trap you know for for the Bitcoin Maxis um so I I think it's possible we are seeing that Devi that deviation high right now only time will tell um I do have hedges in place you know like I'm I'm holding some Bitcoin l2s like STX and some Bitcoin ordinals and things like that that I think would be beneficiaries of you know Bitcoin dominance continued rally maybe above 60% um but of course you know I I really I am of the belief that contextually with Bitcoin chopping under the previous cycle all-time high seeing similar signs of Bitcoin dominance putting in you know this this last explosive push I do believe that over the next six months or so it would probably makes sense to see Bitcoin dominance Trend down dramatically and additionally and and I don't mean to you know bring this up because I don't know if this is on the agenda today exactly I imagine that that would translate to eth BTC finding a bottom sooner rather than later but that doesn't again preclude it from going down a little bit more and only time will tell yeah no I mean it's great and I mean I I I think it's always worthwhile to hear these other views because um you know no one really knows right I mean you know no one really knows and you know one thing that I've wrestled with a lot before and I've seen other people do this too is like you know just because someone gets something right doesn't mean they're going to be right they're going to keep being right right and also just because someone gets something wrong doesn't mean they're GNA be keep being wrong I mean you know markets change no one knows what's going to happen and I I I could see eth Bitcoin carving out a bottom this summer um that's kind of my base case I could see that actually happening so we'll see if that happens Rob what are your thoughts I mean I know you're you're more of a you're more of a Bitcoin Maxi yourself right Bitcoin dominance to 100% I yes exactly go ahead Ben what was your question I'm just kidding I'm just kidding what what are your thoughts here on on on dominance do you think it's uh you think we're getting pretty close to the uh to the top well first of all let me just say that I I I was like listening to to Max especially on like the Twitter spaces and things like that he's very smooth in his delivery and very smart and and what he talks about so I gotta tell you it's good to hear like different sets of opinions it's great to have a Max here so to talk about I mean Bitcoin dominance I got to tell you like when you were talking the 60% I'm like yeah you know I can kind of see it you know I was I was I was under the assumption like well you know it always kind of comes back that way right something happens there's something that happens in the market a Black Swan event or you know something that's just that kind of has disruption and then people get scared and they're they're like okay I'm risk on but not that risk on to go into like you know Pepe coin I'm gonna go into the safest asset in the most volatile industry which would be Bitcoin and I I could see that for sure but then like there's a narrative that that people are always talking about especially in in in the crypto space being the Bitcoin maxos are going to say Bitcoin only right but there are narratives that are out there one of those is dpin Right centralized physical infrastructure Network the other one are dexes because we see what's going on with the centralized exchanges getting sued getting their pants sued off by the SEC and then leaving of course so we have to have dexes and then of course there's another big one which is web 3 so we talk about that but there's one that I feel is on an undertone and Max alluded to it when he was talking about it when he talked about runes and he talked about ordinals and he talked about things like stacks and l2s and I think what's gonna really push Bitcoin dominance up I know Ben loves this part too is uh the the l2s or even l1s that are going to be built on bitcoin Ben if you just throw this this chart up I always talk about this website it's l2. watch so imagine this and I and and and even like Adam back has talked about this how he's talked about he hates the fact that everybody's building off of Bitcoin people should just build on bitcoin because he says it's like it's it's like the tcpip layer for for the internet so why can't they just build on the most the safest most secured Network or computerized Network ever built in the entire world and he was right so when I take a look at these these l2s that are coming out and they're all new so you I to understand like this some most of these are trash let's just let's just call it SP Spade but like when we talk about things that are coming out that are actually doing pretty good like a Stax who's been around for quite some time I can really see things actually happening for sure and then like I just dropped a a video on my second Channel where I talked about core core is a top uh 50 well it's 56 now but it's essentially an L1 L2 type of uh uh token which is built right on top of Bitcoin using delegated proof of work and delegated proof of stake together to actually make dexes nfts and a whole host of things you can only do with smart contracts so when I see stuff like this happening I'm like why can't we take away the nonsense that's going on over in ethereum world and they're massive gas fees like just like with with core and stacks right now if you use it or the things that are being built on top of it they're just going through their Satoshi initiative it's super cheap and it's super fast so for me to see that Bitcoin dominance could go up why couldn't it especially with the different institutions that are here and how they've been drilled into it now they can say oh there's something else I can do and also smart I see it could actually go above 60% but again I'm not always right no I mean I I've it's possible it's certainly possible um I think the answer is going to probably come in the next few weeks because you know there's two prior examples where we had these kind of these like closes below the 8we ese 2021 and 2019 and in 2021 after it happened Bitcoin got a rally eth Bitcoin went up but in 2019 when Bitcoin got that rally eth Bitcoin went down so I think if we see Bitcoin get some type of relief I don't know maybe sometime after the having into may I I don't know exactly when it would be but whenever that comes whatever happens to eth bitcoin should be very telling about where we are in the cycle so I I'm going to be focused a lot on that um over the next few weeks but we will see um next question Rob I'm GNA start with you on this one to rotate and you know I remember last year you saying something like this um and and you ended up being correct it was basically you know sell and man go away um like I mean no one's D Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear since October I mean you know I mean it was basically like 25 to 30k not even that long ago um and I I think sometimes we forget just how quickly it has moved so I'm curious like do you think it's going to be similar to last summer where we just get the market gets boring before maybe moving up again like later in the year or something you think it's just going to get boring for a few months um do you think or on the other hand do you think everyone's gonna get think it's boring and then we just get another you know face what's it called like a face melting Rally or something that's exactly face yeah I mean like so so what are your thoughts going into the summer because I mean again I know last summer you you thought it was going to be boring do you think it's going to be boring again this summer or you think it's going to be different Matt well first of all I I hope so I I really do because everybody who's in the chat right now answer a question for me uh tell me if you think that you've accumulated enough where you're like you know what I've bought plenty of Bitcoin and I just cannot handle any more bags I just I don't want to buy anymore especially if it goes down and gets cheaper just let me know in the comment section because it seems like when these types of things Ben when you say things are boring this is great because this is when people who like the dollar cost average is fantastic or if you're Dynamic DCA is things go down which I think where we at the risk levels now 0.6 0.59 somewhere around there a little yeah I think a little above 0 six so like if we're in this place we're like well I mean for me this is a good time to just accumulate a little bit but as we start to like if it goes sideways well great I have more time to bring things in but then if you if you want to talk about selling May and go away there's this great chart on this website that I steal from constantly and if you just take a look because it's it's yeah it's a nice website it's very nice I think there's a sale going on until like tomorrow and then it goes away so but if if you say sell in May and go away it it actually works out pretty well I mean historically speaking but then if you really want to break it down because people say but Rob you don't get it because this is the having year so it's all it doesn't really it count well if you take a look at it I mean if you sold at the end of May of 2020 I mean you had a 30% increase on January a couple of drops there 34 and 10% and then you're down here and you just kind of stay away until October and then you buy in and then October rallies November rallies and December rallies that's not bad I mean I'll take that year right and if we go back to 2016 I mean it's the same type of thing if I want to sell in May okay well June's gonna go up but I have red red I take I stay away September as well and I I buy back in October November December I'm doing pretty good so I still think it can work out all right the thing that you have to understand though and one more thing is is this there's a presidential election I think this is going to be pretty tumultuous as we get into it so there was this piece from hbk's wealth and it talked about the presidential election years versus the non-election as far as returns and this is just taking a look at the S&P 500 you can see that in the presidential election years which this is that year it sends to like kind of peek off around March April and then just kind of fall away until we get into junisha may go away October is here you buy back in and then we have a nice little rally of course drop here and then off we go but 10% for that year is not too bad now does that mean that I'm going to sell everything no no I'm just telling you these are just the data points that we can say take a look at me personally I'm just here to accumulate and uh get into some early round type of cryptos that could either make a lot of money or go to zero one of those two will always happen yeah I was looking at this um this is uh this is the S&P 500 in 2024 compared to the average of all election years right I mean so you can see like it has come down a lot recently but it also went up a lot too like way more than it does on average so there's just been a lot more volatility this cycle than I think we've seen in a lot of Prior Cycles um but yeah I I thought that was interesting and that chart sort of reminded me of that uh Max what are your thoughts here I mean I know earlier you said you expected uh risk to do pretty well um over the next six months but you know even with that do you think that the market could cool off before that phase or do you think it's not going to really get much of a breather or do you think the Breather is almost over yeah that's it's a it's a great question of course we're all from relatively familiar with the uh maybe cliche but overused but also kind of accurate saying of sell and may go away um one thing that I've been preaching for a while going back to I mean even I would say Q4 of last year is that I was seeing signs early on of a maybe expedited cycle for crypto um and it's probably off of of you know the back of this this fed paw and there isn't quite as much in my opinion economic deterioration as a lot had thought myself included and we're in this you know kind of Goldilocks window where risk can rally really unencumbered um you know so so do I think that selling may go away will come to fruition I I would think that worst case in my opinion from what I'm seeing right now and again of course subject to change it's just one man on the internet's opinion I think that similarly to how this cycle for crypto is being a little bit front Rand and we've actually seen for the first time a Bitcoin all-time high before a having which of course had never happened before um I also think it's possible that selling may go away is being front ran a little bit and we're seeing that right now with this April correction so similarly to Rob I am not I am not in the camp of you know drisking or selling spot because again like I mentioned in you know during our first question here if you just draw four vertical lines on your trading View and Mark out every Bitcoin having look what typically happens in the six to nine months following Additionally you know for a lot of us that have been slowly you know and thoroughly meticulously dcing into our digital digital assets and our unregistered Securities over the past year you know a lot of us have tax consequences for selling right now and I'm I'm not really interested in incurring any uh you know tax consequences trying to reposition because May perhaps is a little bit choppy so in my opinion you know and again going back you know the past 18 months for Bitcoin we haven't seen more than a 22% correction on bitcoin so from our local high recently take it down 22 to 25% maybe you get 57 56 worst case that's not enough for me to incur you know a taxable event to try to reposition so uh maybe it happens maybe it doesn't but for me ultimately it doesn't make a big difference because the having is in a couple days um and typically what happens after a having is months and months of prosperity and hopefully price discovery yeah no it's a fair point I mean I think like all the corrections that we've had by Bitcoin for the entire bull market have only been about 20 to 22% yeah we've already seen it go down about what 18% or so um so that I think that'll be the the area I mean if we get down there see if it turns around and if it does maybe the time's not different you know but yeah what do you think Ben do you think selling May and go away will come to ahead um I think now I mean so I so we went into the 7 to point8 risb in March so that I think was the time to to drisk some kind of like during the spot ETF um at this point it's kind of like when we went back to 39K after the spot ETF um we then it was it was a 22% drop and then we just rallied after it right and and so I was like you know this could be our preh having year dip and then the rally just continued and so now it's kind of the same thing it's like you know the the area to do it if you were convinced about it would have been in in March you know um when gold broke out because that's actually in 2019 when Bitcoin topped was when gold broke out um so I think that would have been the time to do it now I do think there is a risk of if you've waited if you've waited till this point and now bitcoin's down 20% we did see both in after the 20209 or the 2019 top and the 2021 top the first weekly close bow of the 8we SMA we then had a rally back up you know to the we right which is around 67k we actually went slightly above it in both cases so I think what what's more important is not exactly what happens here at the range lows but it's what happens whenever we get a relief move does it sustain or does it just put in a lower high I think that is kind of the thing to look for because back in after the spot ETF it wasn't a lower high we just you know had another face ripping rally fire um the the reason why I am more cautious on this one than than the last one is because eth Bitcoin has now broken down and gold is broken out which both of those events marked the 2019 local top and it wasn't the market cycle top and this kind of goes back to what Rob was saying you know there is this idea of a left translated peak in 2024 and I can sort of like I'm like 30% maybe 40% aware of that like you know thinking hey this is this could actually happen you know if if we were to Rally into the summer to higher prices without cooling off then I would be very more so convinced of a left translated Peak but what if what if if you think about what happened after the 2019 top after gold broke out and after e Bitcoin broke down Bitcoin went into a six to n month bare Market in fact now imagine you get that after the having and everyone thinks the cycle is over by the end of 2024 because it just hasn't done anything since the having and then we just get another move in 2025 and then the cycle Peaks when it always does and once again everyone over complicated it you know like there is a chance that that that happens um so I would I think I would just watch to see what happens whenever we get any type of relief does it form into a lower high or does it lead to a higher high and then you probably have your answer to whether it's a left translit cycle or not at that point I can see absolutely yeah and again even in 2019 it was it was just a local top we bled for a while we actually bled back to the 100 we SMA um and then and then we started to go back back up and then we had the we had the pandemic crash but if you ignore that it was just sort of a bleed after all Bitcoin pairs broke down and then and then once we got that back you know we start to go back up those are my and and by the way I mean you've always said this going back when you know before I started my business and I was watching all of your videos you know years ago Ben you used to always say something kind of along the lines of you know the longer it takes you know the higher will ultimately go something along those lines and you know I think a uh this idea of a prolonged sort of midcycle Correction freaks a lot of people out because everybody wants to be rich overnight myself included right of course i' I'd love for us to just go straight up in a straight line and I hope that we do but ultimately I don't think it would be a death sentence for Bitcoin to kind of reestablish value between 55 and 75k for even a full quarter um you know I think ultimately would probably lead to more constructive uh price action to the upside in the long run but people you know their patients will be tested no question yeah yeah I mean I think the the the thing to look for in the cycle I think is is the Bitcoin dominance I I really do think it's the key for the cryptoverse and I think I think that dominance will Top before Bitcoin Falls below the 20we SMA that's my guess is that it's going to top before Bitcoin Falls below it and I think between now and then Bitcoin gets occasional rallies that just take off Bitcoin pairs even lower is my guess um so that's why I just say like you know if you want exposure to crypto Bitcoin I mean you know Bitcoin is is a relatively safe bet if you want to take on more risk there's obviously the altcoin market there's the full DJ mcoin Market um but you have to be careful with those and I I I think the winning strategy with the altcoin market and and even if you are in the riskier memec coin stuff is just to remember like in five years that Meme coin is probably not going to exist No One's Gonna care about it because they're going to be worried about the next stage of mean points right so the way the way to navigate it is it's okay to have exposure to various parts if you want to take more risk but just occasionally convert it back to bitcoin if you make a lot of money right because at least you know you then know hey Bitcoin is still going to be around in 10 years I don't know if this random meme coin is Ben how could you say that how dare you my a meme coins oh my I think I've converted most of my audience to bitcoin Maxis at this point but I will say by the time I convince the last person to be a Bitcoin Maxi that's when the dominance tops out and we go back the other way I don't think we're that far away I think maybe this summer dominance tops out we'll see though but you are correct like what anybody out there like if we're being completely honest Would You Bet Your Life that Your Meme coin or your altcoin is going to be around in 50 years would You Bet Your Life on it I probably would not would I bet my life I mean it's an extreme example right would I bet my life or something valuable that Bitcoin will be around bet your would you bet all your money on it or something right that's much more friendly right so and I would for Bitcoin I have a high degree of confidence and that's why your strategy ultimately it's conservative you know relative to a lot of other people that you know talk about crypto publicly but it is ultimately a long-term winning strategy and people need to recognize that profits from altcoins ultimately do have to flow back into Bitcoin that is the sustainable strategy for sure yeah I mean I think Rob I think Rob was talking about this what last week on NFA live we were talking about like what do you do when you get an airdrop and I think what was your strategy like just 50% you take profits on it right away 50% back to bitcoin or USD and then you let there oh no no it was you let let it go up 2X or something or if it goes up 2x then you sell 50% was that what you said yeah I I call it well two things I call it the half and half method so you get into meme coins or something crazy and then let's say you put it you know 100 bucks in and then it goes $200 so then you sell half immediately and you put the other hundred bucks let it ride because that's house money then when it doubles or triples or or quadruples then you take half again or you take two or three or 4X what do you want to do and then you let the ride and you do that until there's no more riding and it just goes away and then you're like well okay I I did 8X but it went to zero so I don't feel so bad because a lot of people just let it go all the way up and all the way down but if you just play with house money there's a reason why like like I I can see people in the in the chats going well this sucks because you know now we're gonna sideways and you know this isn't what I want to be there's a reason why all three of us are pretty much just like on all of our videos on all of our Twitter spaces we're pretty much the same person whether it goes massively up or way way down me's a little bit of excitement but it's because we der risked enough to like well if this happens then we do this if this happens we do that and I think that's where people should would want to be as opposed to just going okay I sold my kidney I hope this memec coin goes up it's one of those things have a plan no matter what and then enjoy your life don't stress about it right I mean have a plan like you know if Bitcoin goes to 50K or even lower so what have a plan if it goes up have a plan I mean it I I think you know I used to navigate crypto without without thinking about like what do I do if this happens I only would navigate it based on one particular outcome I never hedge myself but once I started hedging My Views then it makes things easier you know you're like all right well this is what I think but if I'm wrong I don't want to be you know completely left out of whatever that next trend is um and when I when I get air drops um well I don't I don't really get air drops anymore because I'm not really that active in in the space but when I did when I used to get air drops my strategy was immediately convert half of it to bitcoin at least half to bitcoin and then let whatever else ride because like half the time they would just go to zero anyways um so at least you get some of that value out in inss um why don't we goe and move on because we do have two more questions and then I'd also like to get to audience questions at the end if you post your question now I probably won't see it so maybe wait like 10 minutes and then post it um this is an interesting question and I to be completely honest most people aren't going to care but gold is is one of these things where like it doesn't do anything for like 10 years you know and like if you think about this entire bitcoin's like like it's entire history essentially since 2009 gold has essentially gone nowhere in that in that entire phase but we just saw gold break to new all-time highs and it seems to be a somewhat explosive rally so I'm curious about what your thoughts are on gold um I I often think that people who like gold are are more alike to people who like Bitcoin than they would care to admit I think the main difference is the generation that we are right so if I were born one or two generations ago I probably would have been really into gold you know but because I'm born into more of the digital age I'm more into Bitcoin so I think we're more alike than different um so I'm curious like what your thoughts are on gold here it is now 2300 2400 um max where do you you know do you think that uh this is going to continue I me Silver is also not too far behind it in its own move um and I guess the other question is like why do you think gold is rallying so that's probably the bigger question is is why do you think it's rallying rather than like what do you think it's going to go to sure yeah the gold strength is um pronounced it's very impressive um and and I would say I mean why do people buy gold historically right it's sound money it was sound money before Bitcoin it was a store of value when you know our our parents generation was nervous about the state of the world they would you know convert their into gold and uh you know a lot of it is more of a um it's a mental thing it's a it's a mental insulation it's not like if your country was invaded you're going to put you know 500 pounds of gold on your back and somehow travel to another country right but it's a it's a peace of mind thing you know and you know again historically it is you know a sound currency uh there is a scarcity aspect to it there's a lot of commonality and overlap between gold and Bitcoin and I think everything you mentioned Ben is correct um I would say that my bias on gold um really stems more on my perspective and my my forecast on where I think dxy is headed and similarly where I think Bitcoin is headed I've already shared my opinion on where I think Bitcoin is going we have the Bitcoin having just around the corner um I expect Bitcoin to you Trend upwards aggressively over the next six to nine months subsequently I do believe that dxy is forming a sort of distribute you know a distribution here I do anticipate dxy topping very soon and again if you just overlay gold with dxy on a weekly chart you can see that there is a pretty prominent negative correlation between dxy and gold so I don't think we're I'm not of the opinion that we're going to see a decoupling where there's suddenly a a prolonged period of a positive correlation where gold rallies and dxy rallies I think that one of them is lying so either gold is lying or dxy is lying I think that gold is leading and going to see dxy of course sort of reclaim that negative correlation and begin to take a dive over the next quarter so um I do expect gold to continue upwards and I think it's probably off the back of the you know dxy weakening okay yeah fair enough um it has it has been really strong you know and I I can't help but look at it I'm like wow you have like a 10-year base I the bigger the base the more explosive the rally and for I mean for I know like all the crypto you know Deens are like you know it's up what like 10% or something and like people are like you know like 10% is like a minute candle on a meme coin right but for gold you know for an asset that's that high market cap like that is a big move in a really short period of time and so like that's why it it it means something Rob what are your thoughts here um are you are you are you watching this gold move I'm not watch I mean but I own it I own gold and silver and I I think and I don't I never UND and we talk about this many times I never understood why the old maximalists and this and the precious metal maximalists hate Bitcoin so much because like you said we're trying to all do the same thing we're trying to get out of the Matrix which is relying on paper Fiat and it just seems like I there's there's that one gold bug guy that is what we all talk about for some god- awful reason but in reality I think for the majority of people that are into precious metals I think they can see the value behind it and of of of Bitcoin itself and like I I like I never understood with this guy like why don't we have a debate between that guy and like Mike Maloney Mike Maloney is huge into gold he's put out a great series on precious medals and he's he likes Bitcoin as well so like when I take a look at this I I think you know why why not own why not old gold why not diversify like you know uh we've got I diversify not just in the crypto but the stocks precious metals and and real estate and I think everybody should do the you know kind of do the same thing but to talk about why gold went up so much let me I I don't know but how did gold do in 2022 was there any kind of rally during that time I mean it it it it still mostly stayed below the high I don't really think it did that well um it's only recently really started to show strength I mean I can I can pull it up and see but 2022 was kind of split it rallied in the first half of the year and then didn't really do too much and actually corrected a little bit looks like yeah I mean it looks like it topped in March of 2022 and then basically just went down yeah till November and then it rallied again into December kind of there there's a theory going around about why Gold's rallying so much it's because the Nations that are going to war they are trying they're fearful of us sanctions so how do how do you get away get around those sanctions well you stockpile Alternatives and one of those would be of course gold so people are talking about how Iran could be could have stockpiled after the Damascus situation and the and the bombing and the reason why I ask about 2022 is because for the Ukraine Invasion I think was February 2022 and the same type of thing was being said about Russia stockpiling gold at the same time so I can see I can kind of see that that valuation I don't know why they don't just use Bitcoin it's a heck of a lot easier to transfer and zip around value but that's where we're at yeah I always like I always think those posts by the gold bugs are so disingenuous because I mean like I I own both like I own Bitcoin and gold but like if you go to trading View and you look at the Bitcoin or you look at the Gold valuation against Bitcoin it's down so much since Bitcoin launched that it rounds it to negative 100% like like that's how far the valuation of gold has fallen against Bitcoin since Bitcoin has been around so again like it's not it's just look I mean the the Bitcoin valuation as far exceeded gold for a long time um I mean my guess is over the next 20 years Bitcoin will still outperform gold you know maybe in the short term gold could outperform uh Bitcoin but and I I mean I guess it has been since March right ever since gold broke out Gold's been doing better than even the S&P 500 even the NASDAQ um it's been having my view is that I I I think that gold is breaking out because it senses that um rate cuts are coming sooner than the market is potentially thinking and so that's kind of why I think I I think it's sort of sniffing something out just like it did in 2019 and and um but we'll see I mean you know we'll see if it if it plays out in the same way last question and I mean I you know this is more so geared towards Max um because I mean Rob is I mean you know you've been around here forever we' probably even asked this question you before yeah but I mean if you want to take it if you want to answer you can Max Max yeah so since you're new here um why did you start your YouTube channel I mean like what what was your motivation what are you helping to accomplish with it uh what brings you here well Ben you you actually played a big role in in bringing me here I was a very early follower of yours actually before you even had your website I bought your Google sheet way back in the day and I'm still locked into my original price thank you very much because I got in early pays to get in early um you know I I learned a lot from you in the very beginning and I went through last cycle and you know Ben and and Rob also this you know this is a compliment to both of you guys amongst a sea of grifters and thieves and people looking to prey on unsuspecting retail you know guys like yourselves you you conducted yourselves in a manner that you know I mean I can't even imagine how many millions of dollars you guys turn down from shill deals and you know crap like that and you know I I wanted to in the beginning play my you know play my part in that I felt as though I had opinions that you know um I could share something to offer I have you know I have an ability to lead I have you know an ability to organize a team um and I wanted to play my my part my equal share in the sort of collective hive mind of you know CT and and YouTube and help educate that's sort of the underpinning of of what I'm doing is I like to teach I like to collaborate and you know making money certainly feels nice right but there's a certain there's a certain sense of fulfillment that I personally get out of somebody messaging me saying hey because of what you said it made a difference in my life and something clicked for me and that feels really good and you know I I started because Bitcoin and it was it's a small Channel still um we're growing quickly certainly which of course if you go to Ben's beautiful website and you overlay social media growth with uh you know the price of Bitcoin you can see why I'm starting to grow quicker it's it's I'm doing the same thing I was doing all bare Market it's just suddenly more people care about crypto so um you know I am a i a result of good times and I pray that they continue on because of course it's you know a nice Tailwind for for my young business but yeah I mean really to answer the question Point Blank I love to teach I love to to collaborate and I love to debate you know like I have a differing opinion than you know you guys for some things and there's some overlap but that's what makes a market beautiful is that you can think one thing I can think another and we can come together and just talk about it politely and nobody knows what's going to happen right like we can't I have my hunch I have conviction just like you guys do but Bitcoin dominance could go to 90% And you know even over flip it and put that on on Twitter don't do that don't do that or or it could literally nuke down to 10% we could have like the crypto equivalent of the NASDAQ bubble between 1995 and 2000 where altcoins bubble like people you know can't imagine everybody's thrown money at altcoins speculating anything that's crypto and then 99 out of 100 of them don't exist in a couple years you know so who who knows what's going to happen but yeah I love to to collaborate and teach and debate and uh generally it's it's just a passion of mine how many subscribers are you guys at now like 13 14k or something yes on YouTube somewhere in between there yeah well there's 3,600 people watching so if everyone here goes and clicks the link in the description below and goes over to Max's Channel and subscribes then uh I I'm sure he would appreciate that and I think he deserves that he's been they've been putting out they it's not just Max by the way I mean it's a team of people um so go check that out you guys do like daily live streams right we Yeah we actually have a show coming up at uh 10:00 a.m. eastern time we do a Daily Show we've got a panel of Five Guys we're all just Traders wrap this one up then if you got it coming up in 10 minutes that's okay I got a big team they got it all right well before we before we end it here I I did want to take at least a couple of questions um and one of the questions I saw was um what is the best way to learn about crypto and to do your own research so I mean I don't know if they're talking about like from a fundamental perspective but I if someone were getting into crypto like like what do you guys use to do your research and I mean and maybe talk about like all the different tool or some at least some of the bigger tools that you guys have been using especially for all the different things that are happening in the cryptoverse there seems like there's a thousand different narratives that you could you know that you could follow and whoever wants to take that one is fine go ahead Max yeah um I would start on uh one of our three channels I think that's a really good place not to not to spew the obvious but um I would say I would say learn to do very basic ta right and understand Cycles like there's some very awesome free indicators out there like I mean you can even just look at like you know Ben has a a you he's kind of coined a very famous one he's combined a 20 week SMA and a 21 we EMA which has been sort of uh marketed as the bull market band for good reason right so you can determine when you know Bitcoin is trending upwards High time frame or trending down by just a simple you moving average band there's also things like the P Cycle top which I think people should keep an eye on which is again a free trading view indicator someone someone made it it's also on Ben's website there's also some some good onchain stuff like you know Bitcoin terminal price hoddle waves things like that I would as a beginner I would stay off the hourly time frame like literally just go daily time frame and above um and whenever you see Bitcoin down you know 50% from its its all-time high that's time to start paying attention to maybe consider entering the market but you know learn very very basic ta and and some of the more popular onchain indicators can really help you just DCA at the right time you know but stay off of the hourly time frames mainly the py cycle top just to give credit is uh was developed by Philip Swift um a while back and I the the idea was to predict the top with within 3 days and it did a really great job of doing that in the first uh the first 2021 Peak um and it actually happened I remember it happening and like no one really believed it you know um but I think it was retrofit right it was fit after yeah it was created in 2019 it was created in 2019 okay but it did it did get the first top in 2021 I feel like a lot of these like metrics that everyone created in 2019 uh it they called the first top but then most of them like didn't really call the second top because it was just sort of like a it was like a dead cat bounce that just somehow made it to New highs you know yeah um so yeah that was kind of an interesting one um Rob did you have anything to add just yeah just one thing Max makes all great points the thing I would say is that if you really knew you really really knew you have to understand that it's not how much you make it's how much you keep and the big thing is that you have to watch out for scams and things to watch out for and if you're gonna get into like hot storage wallets stuff like that there's a there's a video in the in the link of in the description of all my videos and it says you know things you the the big mistakes in crypto and it has like 20,000 views and of course it's the most important video I probably have ever put out because that's what people get screwed out and they get scammed out and if they watch that video they wouldn't happen to them another video I did when I'm gonna sell on my crypto has over 100,000 views so it just goes to show you like where the priorities are the priorities are make money but really the priority should be keep money someone's asking a um this the Market's not pricing it in right now but I did see like last night there's been a couple of times here where like there's at least some in investors like thinking about a rate hike um that is not like my base case at all like I think they're done I I think five and a half percent is the terminal rate for this cycle they might go higher next cycle uh but I I think five and a half percent at the top I'm not going to ask you if you think they're gonna hike again because I don't really think any of us think they're going to um if you do think that let me know but I guess my main question is what do you think would happen if they did hike again um because that be I mean that would talk about markets not pricing it in right I mean like I guess the the implication would be like if if the economy just accelerates into you know again and and there's not a cool down and we just keep on moving up uh what would a rate what would another rate hike do well what was real quick what was what is what has Jerome Powell said about fighting inflation do they say that they're on the right track or do they say like there's it's more more stubborn what he they've kind of like the progress has slowed a lot and I I think they've kind of specul that it it might influence their the number of rate Cuts this year because previously they had said three rate Cuts this year and I'm I'm wondering if they're starting to walk I mean now the market is pricing in only two rate cuts through April of 2025 so I my view is that you know I thought higher for longer but now that everyone else believes it I think I think it's going to go back the other way because once the market fully prices in no rate Cuts that's when people give up and you need to start having some rate cuts um but yeah I don't know I mean pal Po's basically said the same thing he said for the last three years if you know they're they're going to keep rates higher for longer until inflation's durably going back to 2% yeah I I think that 3% is is the new 2% truthfully I I I appreciate their narrative and their consistency and and how they haven't wavered on that and I think it's a great goal um but it seems like three is kind of a magnet actually a little above three um like you mentioned they are currently pricing in now it looks like you know our first 25 basis point cut on the uh September 18th meeting and then through April 2025 and and these percentages change all the time right uh you know we'll see what happens um you know potentially taking us down 50 basis points off of where we're currently at um let me answer your question what would happen if we got another 25 basis point hike because you know inflation decides it's going to rear its ugly head again and and start trending up above you know headline four 5% God forbid it's over I mean like we are going to absolutely nuke if we get another rate I'm gonna be as as clear as I can be if we get another rate hike markets are going to capitulate like that will be awful horrible for risk like sell all of your assets honestly like if that happens I'm not joking I think it'd be terrible I don't know if you guys agree with me but that would be horrible for markets but I don't think that's going to happen to be clear I think you could have the same thing happen if they just refuse to cut soon enough too because like it it you know like a tightening cycle is not just raising rates but it's also keeping rates too high for too long and the median number of months that the FED pauses is eight and eight would have been in March um so we've already gone nine I think there's still you know there's still a window where talks about a soft Landing right it's so hard to thread that needle to a soft Landing because you have to stay high enough to make sure inflation doesn't come back in a second wave because if you don't and you get an inflation a secondary wave like the 70s you get a hard Landing but if you stay high for too long like let's say they stay at five and a half percent for another six months then you start to run the risk of of a deflationary crash right so that's why everyone sort of rolls their eyes about a soft Landing is because it's so difficult to thread that needle and I don't I do not envy their job I I do not envy their job because it's not and and they're also operating with long and variable lags like how can they know all the effects of prior monetary policy um so yeah it's it's a tough place for them to be and and we are oh sorry Rob go ahead no no go ahead Max I was going to say you know we are seeing some smaller economies in my opinion forecasting when our rate cuts are coming like we have seen the Czech Republic actually start to cut we've seen Poland cut um so it you know historically it's not perfect right but you are starting to see some of these smaller countries actually they they LED through the hik so they began to hike first they paused first and they've actually started to cut so I I do anticipate that you know in similar fashion to what has happened historically we will see the US begin to I guess cut rates hopefully uh later this year um but I do agree with you Ben like if they held rates where they're currently at through you know all of 2024 that would also put some pressure um on our economy and our markets but with that said like I don't know what you you guys think but I mean really the the final you know real dagger or Domino to fall is going to be of course unemployment creeping up above four four and a half percent do you guys think that if they just held rates where they're currently at all through 2024 um but we didn't see the labor market really deteriorate could financial markets hold up in that instance I mean if if the labor market doesn't deteriorate sure I just think that um I mean it seems like the unemployment rate is trending up um and the the problem with with that is that it doesn't tend to move in a linear fashion right it it goes slow and then it starts to accelerate at some point and we haven't reached the acceleration phase right so there's still a chance that we can avoid it but the longer they wait the the the riskier that's going to be I think I think there's a higher probability of a rate cut this summer than the market is giving credit for I don't think it has to happen this summer but I think the right thing to do is to cut at least 25 basis points uh this summer 50 basis points something like that just uh provide something you know are you thinking in the June meeting or July meeting I mean look last cycle I know that that the altcoin market was a lens into the consumer and I know that that when alts broke down against Bitcoin and when eth broke down against Bitcoin the FED basically cut one month later um and we we have seen eth fall against Bitcoin it had a weekly close below the June low we saw madic Bitcoin uh crash below it's June 2022 low we've seen adaa Bitcoin and Dot bit coin we've seen Litecoin Bitcoin and a Bitcoin I mean so many of these altcoins are are falling off their Bitcoin support levels and you can see it with the Bitcoin dominance so I think that the pricing out of all these rate Cuts is going to cause them to get priced in because the FED does not base their decisions on what our altcoins are doing right un they don't care what I what I what I find unfortunate is that a lot of the small like companies like Mom and Pop shops a lot of them are going out of business business right now because you know rates are going up and and and times are getting harder like inflation is so high so people just can't afford as much and but the FED has to do it because all of us Deens in the in the space can't help ourselves from bidding up jpegs you know and and and leading inflation uh to to where it was so I think that it's it's kind of a tough spot to be and the FED has to stay long enough to kind of break the animal spirits but if they do it too long then you then then you run the other issue of of a deflationary um unwind and that's not really fun either I know like people are like oh I'd love to go to the store and not spend as much money but if you if prices go down that's probably not good for risk assets terrible just yeah so everybody everybody who's watching the videos remember this when when you think like okay the Bitcoin Market or the crypto Market has to do this thing it has to do this thing because it's it's been the cycle that's always done this doesn't actually work like what we just talked about just how fragile the markets actually are and just to think how things have to really go in line before you realize that oh maybe I should have taken some profits when there was uh everything was overheated just it's just something to think about because I hate people who roundtrip and uh they really should again take some profits when everything gets too hot and and one thing just to mention about rate cuts and I mean you guys probably know this rate Cuts inherently are not bearish right it's it's the underpinning as to why they are cutting rates and you know if you actually on a granular level you go and you overlay the effective federal funds rate with you know the NASDAQ or S&P 500 markets actually tend to rally for like 30 to 60 days give or take following the First Rate cut until they wake up and they realize oh crap there's economic deterioration under the surface which is why they're cutting rates and then we see these major Corrections so I think whether the first 25 basis point comes in June or the end of July meeting or I guess hopefully September um that's probably your 30 to 60-day warning truthfully whenever it comes and I don't know when it will and what about no go ahead I was going to say you're right I mean like the rate Cuts inherently are are are bullish for risk assets if they're cutting for the right reasons in 2019 while Bitcoin topped out when rate Cuts arrived the S&P 500 kept going up and you know because the mark like the the economy was not in a recession right it wasn't going into a recession they were sort of like preliminary rate Cuts You could argue that Bitcoin is more tied to financial markets today traditional markets today than it was back then because of the spot ETF so maybe it would track the S&P 500 a bit closer than it did last cycle once rate Cuts arrive but the issue is why the FED is cutting are they cutting because they're trying to get ahead of something bad that's coming or are they cutting as a reactionary thing because they just saw a really bad labor market prance and that is is when they're not bullish like that's when rate cuts are be so it all depends on Max is right it all depends on why they're cutting and and I think that it's also risky to I I I do believe that there's just as much risk to the UPS side truthfully where you know assuming that they're going to cut because there is severe economic deterioration can also be you know a very harmful strategy long term because like you mentioned the first batch of rate cuts that we saw in 2019 um you know the S&P 500 rallied out of those cuts like 15% and then of course we had our Co nuke in March which took us below you know where that that first uh cut occurred right but you know again it's like you have to be very careful you kind of threading your own needle per se because just because they're cutting doesn't mean sell everything right because they could cut you know the labor market could be more resilient than anybody's expecting the S&P 500 could go up 50% over the next year and then something bad happens and you get a correction but that correction doesn't take you down to as low as the point in which the first cut happens so you just have to be a little bit careful truthfully you know you have to really understand why they're cutting and and it's a tough thing to do it's very tough I me with the S&P you know there there's been all sorts of like crises throughout all the decades but if you just pull up a chart over a 100 years I mean you know the the the overall trend is clear you know um the markets generally go up because the money supply yeah yeah you know why did prices of houses go up 40% because the supply of money went up 40 per. you know it's not it's not I it's not really that complicated so yeah no I mean I think like as always right like time in the market often beats time the market um because it's impossible to to actually time the market for under most circumstances and I think sometimes people get lucky with it and then assume that they're like a genius and can do it again and again and again um but the reality is that the market will humble us all at some point why don't we go ahead and wrap it up there um we we'll have NFA live back I guess next week next week I think it'll be on Rob's Channel um so we'll see you guys over there next week and again if you're not subscribed uh to to Max or Rob links for their channels are in the description below and uh we will see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-04-18 00:00:00,"The discussion covers several key topics related to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and the broader cryptocurrency market. The speakers provide technical analysis and share their views on the potential impact of the halving, as well as the influence of macroeconomic factors and the Federal Reserve's policies.The speakers acknowledge the historical pattern of Bitcoin price rallying in the year following a halving event, but also caution that the current market conditions and macroeconomic environment could introduce some uncertainty and volatility. They discuss the concept of sell in May and go away, analyzing past market cycles and the potential for a similar pattern this year, while also noting that the halving year may disrupt this traditional seasonal trend.The discussion also touches on the importance of Bitcoin dominance as a key indicator for the overall crypto market, with the speakers suggesting that Bitcoin dominance may peak before Bitcoin itself falls below its 20-week moving average. This leads to a broader conversation about the risks and opportunities in the altcoin and meme coin markets, with the speakers emphasizing the importance of having a diversified strategy and regularly converting gains back into Bitcoin as a more stable and long-term investment.Additionally, the speakers explore the recent strength in the gold market, discussing the potential reasons behind the rally and the relationship between gold, the US dollar, and Bitcoin. They note the similarities between gold and Bitcoin as stores of value and the potential for gold to continue its upward trend as the US dollar weakens.The speakers also provide insights on the importance of understanding basic technical analysis and on-chain indicators to help identify the right times to enter the market, emphasizing the need to focus on higher timeframes and avoid getting caught up in the volatility of the hourly charts. They highlight the value of educational resources, such as their own YouTube channels, in helping newcomers to the crypto space navigate the market and avoid common pitfalls like scams and mistakes in managing their funds.Finally, one of the speakers, Max, shares his motivation for starting a YouTube channel, highlighting the desire to contribute to the crypto community in a positive and educational way, drawing inspiration from the approach taken by the other speakers.Overall, the discussion provides a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the current state of the cryptocurrency market, the potential impact of the Bitcoin halving, and the broader macroeconomic factors that may influence the market's performance in the coming months.",470,"[0.012069702, 0.032226562,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin dubious speculation if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom link is in the description below the prices will be going up after the having so make sure to lock in the lower rate between now and then we have a website full of thousands of charts for different cryptocurrency um and I also put out three uh videos a week on on the premium side uh so a lot of stuff going on over there make sure you guys check that out links in the description below let's go and jump in so lots happening in the cryptoverse right now um I've talked a lot about sort of the mechanics behind different ways in which the cryptoverse operates and so in this video what I'd like to do is revisit a lot of those things and and kind of talk about like where we are and what we might see going into into the summer if if things play out like like they have in the past and you know it's only you know the having is is coming up really soon I mean I'm I'm recording this video Wednesday night the having is only a couple days away by the time you see this video it might only be a day away um so certainly a lot that's an exciting event in the cryptoverse but I'm more so in this video focused on what just do the charts say what's going on with the charts so let's go ahead and jump in with things like the bull market support band The 8we ese one of the interesting things to note about the 8we SMA is that there is this exception right here where we sort of got a a fake out below it and we talked about it how you know if you just get right back Above It Without Really any follow through the following week then it it is just a fake out and that happens just like you had a fake out right here above the bullmark sport B it does sometimes happen um it doesn't mean the general view is not worthwhile to follow of following the 8we ese it's just that sometimes you do get those very brief fake outs one of the things that I've mentioned many many times is that falling below the 8we SME would be a significant Milestone and this drop here at this point does seem somewhat significant be that as it may you know I don't know what's going to happen going into the having I imagine the Bulls would try uh their hardest to get it back above the 8we SMA but the 8we SMA is all the way back up at at 67k you I'm not saying it's impossible but it is quite a bit higher than where we currently are now let's go through a scenario where we close the week below the 8we moving average and I just want to go back and look at what previously happened after these manic rallies that lasted for a long time what happened after we got that first close below the 8we estimate and we're going to look at three examples we're going to look at 2019 we're going to look at at um 2021 early 2021 we're going to look at the second peak in 2021 okay so in 2021 the first peak of 2021 what you'll notice and by the way there are some there definitely are similarities right between this rally here um and and this one over here notably this we really got kicked off right here in October of 2020 and it and it sort of rallied out until March and April right we had a March Peak and then an April Peak which was slightly higher this rally also really got going in October after of it built out a base right I mean you can kind of see the same thing how Bitcoin built out a base here and then went into its Mania mode starting in October with it topping out ultimately in April kind of the same thing right I mean it it sort of built out its base again and then this move really got started in October with a potential local top at least uh in in March uh so far so what's interesting is if you zoom in to this trend it actually does look somewhat familiar um right here you can see that you know you we had a couple of red weeks uh we had a couple of red weeks right here really small red weeks just like that one then we had a couple of small green weeks that took us right back up kind of the same thing and then you had another Wick up now the main difference this time though is that in 2020 and 2021 in that rally what we ultimately saw happen was that the first Peak actually occurred in March was a lower high than the actual top in April of a higher high in this case at least what we've seen so far is that the local top in March has actually exceeded so far the top that we have seen in April but you will you will know there's you know two pretty clear Wicks there um just like there were right here and ever since then Bitcoin has been coming back down now what you will notice though is that after the first weekly close below the 8we moving average Bitcoin then actually had a relief rally back above its 8-week moving average right it have had a relief rally back above it and I know that often times you will see Bitcoin find local tops in April we saw a local top in April of 2021 and in April of 2013 even in 2023 we had a local top in April before just sweeping the highs in June so April does tend to be a significant month but also you know I talked a lot about how there is this other idea about how going into the merge eth actually topped out one month before the merge before getting a fairly substantial pullback right if you look closely here the merge was in September which was here which actually was in fact a lower high you know um and and so I I do think that's a relevant way to think about the market as well but going into this move here that first weekly close below the 8we s ma we then got a TW we relief rally following it now not all of these Trends are going to be the same there's somewhere that doesn't happen and we're going to go through each one so in the first one though you will note that there is a low here and then a higher low we ultimately saw Bitcoin bottom out a local bottom between this low in March and the low in February right so you can see we went below that low but we stayed above the one from March now if you go to today you will see something at least so far is similar right there's this low here in March that we have gone below but we yet haven't gone below that occurred a little we haven't gone below this low at least not yet that occurred a little bit before that so I would say watch that especially going into the weekend you know do we take out that low do we not if we don't take out that low um and we are still you know we get a weekly close below the 8we SMA then look to see if it does get uh that sort of a bounce if it does what happens and and this is the you know the question I've seen a lot of people debating this on on X um and and on and of course on YouTube and a lot of people are assuming right they're assuming that in such a bounce that bit coin Domin they think that they would say that Bitcoin dominance would go down right in such a balance their speculation some of them is that Bitcoin dominance would go down right I mean basically everyone on crypto X has been calling the top on bitcoin Dominus for the last two and a half years so why should this time be any different but they're essentially saying that if it does bounce here the Bitcoin dominance will go down now I'm actually going to show you there is at least some evidence to support that potential view but it's not my base case in fact now you might say why because if you look in 2021 you will notice that that is exactly where the eth tsunami occurred do you guys remember the eth tsunami right it was when eth basically goes up about 2x in two weeks and it occurred on a dead cap Bounce by Bitcoin do you see what happened with eth Bitcoin during that time it skyrocketed so you might say Ben if that were to happen why wouldn't eth Bitcoin do the same thing well again I am glad you asked and I think there is a relevant way to look at the market that would dispute that view the first way which is a bit hand wavy and I'm not asking you to take it to the bank is that leading into that move e Bitcoin was in an uptrend right so it was sort of putting in higher lows and higher highs and also the Fed was expanding their balance sheet right so we know that when the FED expands their balance sheet we see eth Bitcoin go up when the FED reduces their balance sheet we see e eth Bitcoin go down okay so pretty clear so then beyond that let's suppose other than just saying well it was going up over here therefore it was going to keep going up it's going down over here therefore it's going to keep going down other than the momentum argument what can we look towards okay and this is where when you look very closely at 2019 you should find the answer that you are looking for and that answer lies within a very similar bounce after going below the 8we SMA now look very closely at Bitcoin in 2019 a lot of people refuse to compare Bitcoin in 2024 to 2019 because they say this is the having year that was a a a preh having year so why should we make the comparison the reason why we should make the comparison is because 2019 was a p pivot year for the Federal Reserve and I suspect that 2024 will also be a pivot year for a long time there's been a lot of debate as to whether monetary policy actually affects crypto in the same way it does traditional markets and I've obviously been on the side that it does there's been a lot of people that say that it doesn't and that's why they thought that Bitcoin dominance was going to top out last year because in 2020 in 2019 it topped out in the prehab year right in the last cycle it topped out in the prehab year so they assume that it it would do that in if you don't if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about if you go over to say a year-to-date Roi of of Bitcoin dominance right we worked it in right if you go over and look at a year-to DAT Roi of Bitcoin dominance without stable coins and you look at 2024 you will see that if you compare it to 2016 2016 it basically just went down 2012 well 2012 there wer any other coins but 2020 it basically just went down right um 2024 it's just been staying mostly up and it hasn't really seen that large of move to the downside and I think that is a lot and that's evidence right there that shows you that monetary policy is having an effect in the prior cycle we were already back to QE and so Bitcoin dominance was going down but we're still in quantitative tightening right now so the answer to the question of why wouldn't eth Bitcoin see a durable rally upon a potential you know sort of relief rally back up to the 8we SME if it were to even come which there's no guarantee and we're going to get to a third example in a minute is 2019 now you see what happened in 2021 right the first weekly close below the 8we SMA we got this relief rally and eth Bitcoin shot up quite a lot right we know that and I just showed it a second ago but I I'll pull it back up eth Bitcoin will overlay it on the screen you can see pretty clearly during that move if I make make make these different colors here but during that move we saw eth Bitcoin go up so why should this time be different well if you look at 2019 and you look at the exact same pattern what you will notice is that it played out very similar to 2021 in fact it's just that the nature of what happened to the rest of the market was completely different look at 2019 we also had a weekly close below the 8we SMA the week of July 22nd right you see it pretty clearly right there right the week of July 22nd a weekly close below the 8we SMA in fact that Weekly close below the 8we SMA occurred exactly 4 weeks later after the local top right exactly 4 weeks later if you go look at it over here from this local top it might be a little bit further out but you can see it's been five weeks later potentially if we in fact get that Weekly close below the 8we SMA now what you'll notice is that just like 2021 Bitcoin had a relief rally following its first weekly close below the 8we SMA but in that case you did not see eth Bitcoin go up instead instead you saw it continue to go down right it continued to go down on that relief rally why did it continue to go down well first of all it was already turning down into that area right so momentum continued to carry it down but also you can see that the Fed was still reducing the size of their balance sheet and therefore while in 2021 the Dead the the the relief rally that came actually in May right I mean it it actually occurred um in it really materialized late April going into early May kind of a very similar setup if you think about it right late April going into early may you can see that it it it went back up to the 8we SMA and eth Bitcoin fell but the Fed was expanding the size of their balance sheet during that time today it's different in the sense that the FED is reducing the size of the balance sheet and so I think it's more tenable to compare it to what happened over here in 2019 where we got a similar type of move where eth Bitcoin actually dropped okay so that is why I think that is more likely that eth Bitcoin drops under such a circumstance that it actually goes up now there's no guarantee you even get a relief rally next week um there there's really no guarantee that that even happens at all and you know for for evidence for that you'd have to actually look no further than 2021 itself but at the second top right so in the second top after we fell below the 8we SMA um that first weekly close below it right rather than getting a relief rally the following week Bitcoin just capitulated down okay in in the week of November 29th right so it just capitulated down but I want to show you something uh on a lower time frame with eth Bitcoin because when I overlay it here you can only see a little bit of it look at the eth Bitcoin chart okay now look at Bitcoin USD and let's figure out what week this was where Bitcoin got the weekly close below the 8we ese in 2019 it was the week of July 22nd now look at eth Bitcoin the week of July 22nd where was it it was right here this was the week of July 22nd so it had just followed the breakdown of e Bitcoin delayed by one week actually delayed by one week so it's one week off here but the week that Bitcoin had its first weekly close below the 8we ES eth Bitcoin was actually a green candle and it occurred two weeks after eth Bitcoin broke down what happened the following week when Bitcoin got the relief rally back above the 8we SMA the week of July 29th and the week of August 5th you will see very clearly the week of July 29th and August 5th eth Bitcoin dropped 8 and a half% and then it dropped 75% now there could be some form of diminishing vol to the downside if you look at when eth Bitcoin has previously broken down you can see that in the first instance it actually dropped quite a lot from the range low it went down about 40 something per like 47 maybe even a little bit more um you know it went around down around 50% or so whereas in this drop over here it only dropped around 33% so it wasn't as big of a drop so perhaps if Bitcoin were to see some type of move like that um you could see e Bitcoin drop but you know getting you know as it's now below the range low which is exactly what happened right there that first move down after that was about a 20% drop that still wasn't the bottom but it was a 20% drop even if you get even if you get from here next week even if you get say a 10% drop that puts eth Bitcoin at 043 which coincidentally corresponds to this top here so my base case is that if we were to get some type of relief bounce into back up to the 8we SMA sometime in the next couple of weeks next few weeks or so then I would actually assume that eth Bitcoin continues to break down just like it did over here that would be my base assumption because we know where we are in the cycle based on on monetary policy that is my base assumption now there is something that theoretically challenges that now but before we get to that I I will say that there's no guarantee right if you're if you're over here thinking you know that means there's some type of relief rally that's going to come save your altcoin bags that might not actually be true because even if there is a relief rally that I buy Bitcoin that does not guarantee a commencer relief rally for whatever altcoin that you hold do you know over here when Bitcoin had that move back to the 8we SMA do you see that move 15% the week of July 29th 5% the week of August 5th pretty nice move right 15% followed by 5% what did eusd do right what did ethusd do those two weeks nothing I mean basically nothing the week of July 29th went up 5% so during a week where Bitcoin went up 15% eth went up 5% and then the following week when Bitcoin went up another 5% eth went was negative it dropped it dropped 3% so that was what caused the devaluation of the eth Bitcoin pair it was the fact that Bitcoin was bouncing around and it was just chopping the altcoin market up because there's a stronger bid for Bitcoin because the altcoin market just keeps on bleeding back to it so you can see pretty clearly that that's what happened right Bitcoin occasionally got relief bounces but it just I mean it ate the altcoin market up during that time and I think the same thing is happening now I think that Bitcoin is it's chopping around this range up here the same way it did in 2019 the same way right it's chopping around this range and every single week that we get any type of continued chop what's happening eth Bitcoin continues to slowly grind down Bitcoin dominance continues to slowly grind up what will likely Mark the top for Bitcoin dominance well it'll probably correspond sometime after the First Rate cut and it could correspond back to quantitative easing now what's interesting is if you look at at at Bitcoin us Bitcoin dominance topped before Bitcoin fell below the bull market support ban if you overlay Bitcoin dominance onto this chart you will see that it actually topped right here in September and then we fell below the bull market support band Bitcoin did just a couple of weeks later now I think something similar could happen again Bitcoin dominance could actually top before Bitcoin USD goes below the 20we SMA there's a good chance chance that could happen if this were to repeat itself but what needs to happen between now and then would be that Bitcoin just kind of chops around for a while and every time it gets those moves back up it breaks alts down even more remember during High rates and quantitative tightening Bitcoin rallies break the altcoin market down there is no guarantee that it has to be on a Bitcoin rally there are examples where all Bitcoin pairs break down on bitcoin dumps and you should have realized that this past week when Bitcoin dropped and altcoins dropped a lot more right we've seen it before it happened it it it also happened back over here in in May of 2022 you can see that Bitcoin dropped and during that time eth Bitcoin right as as Bitcoin dropped e Bitcoin initially went up or sorry no so this is Bitcoin dominance as this dropped Bitcoin dominance went up right and then you can see it went all it didn't top here until Bitcoin hit a local bottom so there's no guarantee you even get a relief rally back to the 8we SME if we end up following what happened over here in late 2021 so I think it would be foolish to say try to take that to the bank there's no guarantee furthermore even if you do get a relief rally it doesn't mean it has to start next week we already showed that it's off by a week when you look at eth Bitcoin so maybe maybe we just kind of sit hum drum for a week and nothing happens but imagine what that would be like if sometime after the having you know everyone is thinking oh you know that's it everything's over uh you know wo is me and then right as everyone gets up or gives up there's some type of of relief and then everyone's like oh see I told you so and then it ends up just resolving into a lower high in May right and and maybe it resolves into a lower high in May because the unemployment rate in May comes in super hot or maybe the inflation rate comes in super hot I don't know um but that could be something to sort of keep in mind I do think there's a lot of evidence supporting a a potential summer lull um and I I want to talk a little bit about that I will say you know before I get too much further into this like guys like I could be wrong right I mean you know sometimes I get things wrong I'm not asking you to take these views to the bank I'm just doing the best I can sometimes I'm right sometimes I'm wrong come up with a strategy not based on what I'm saying please uh I just this is just my view on the market and again you know if you're looking for someone that's going to be 100% right about something if you find them don't tell anyone about them right I mean keep them to yourselves um but these are just my and and you know they may play out they may not so from here I mentioned earlier you know there's some evidence to suggest that you know that there could be still some left um you know sort of like a period where Bitcoin dominance still kind of wains for a little bit and maybe the best evidence for that is to go look at at the dominance excluding stable coins you look at the dominance excluding stable coins in 2019 you'll see a very similar pattern right as a series of lower highs and lower lows before we ultimately went up and swept the highs same thing over here right lower highs and lower lows and we've G we've gone on up and we swept the highs we talked about this many many times that's likely what's going to happen and everyone was like no it's a having year you don't know what you're talking about and here we are we put in a new high we actually saw Bitcoin dominance go to 57% which means that everyone who spent the last two and a half years calling the top on bitcoin dominance was once again wrong so we swept the high look what happened last time we swept the high dominance excluding Stables we did see dominance pull back a little bit um before then going back up and it actually pulled back in June right in June now this move here though was a lot more substantial right it actually went well above the high before getting a pullback these moves over here by dominance were a lot more substantial as well so if you do see a pullback here by Bitcoin dominance which you've actually already seen I mean you can see it's already pulled back a little bit I don't think it would be as big as this one because this trend over here is sort of like a miniature version of this one right it's sort of like a miniature version of it and I've tried to think like what would cause you know you know what could potentially continue to cause something like that and you know again it could be just SL to the devaluation of Bitcoin um where where Bitcoin kind of keeps going down a little bit and the altcoin market is is sort of holding because last week the altcoin market took a huge hit and so you know there's there's sort of some recovery going on over there um I don't know if that would be the reason or not but my base case is to not really give or not really care at all about that because who cares right I mean more than likely in two months the dominance is going to be much higher than where it is today okay I don't know if it's going to go back below 55% between now and then frankly I don't care I spent the last two and a half years dealing with trolls on Twitter telling me on every single Bitcoin dominance dump why I was wrong and again it just keeps on going higher so I wouldn't worry too much if there is a pullback in Bitcoin dominance I do think that it's going to go much higher into the summer at which point I think you could make a case that eth Bitcoin could maybe bottom out this summer right I'm thinking June at the earliest is my guess but again I'm you know subject to change that opinion I don't really have like a super strong opinion on it I just think if it were to play out like prior Cycles we saw that both prior Cycles when eth Bitcoin broke down it took about eight weeks for it to bottom so you know it if it took about 8 weeks again you see there was eight weeks here was about 8 weeks or so um if it if it were to take eight weeks that would essentially put it in in early to mid June which by the way is exactly when it bottomed out in 2022 so maybe this time is not different and it just bottoms out in the summer um I'm thinking June maybe July it kind of depends on on what eth Bitcoin does after the having the reason I say that is because you know after the spot ETF eth Bitcoin had this relief bounce um and it and made a lot of people sort of fomo back in right because it had this relief balance but I said it's probably just going to be a lower high and it was um and I even said this is probably going to be a lower high and it was and I was sort of just looking at the 2019 comparison a high and a lower high right it was It was kind of the same thing in the sense that you have this low you bounce off the low you put in a high you put in a lower high and then you go back down to low again and um we're kind of seeing that here kind of seeing that right here where you have your first low your first low and then your second low and your second low right and then you even had a third low before it got another bounce right the main difference though is here it's already broken support here it actually didn't so I don't really know that it has to get this bounce if it does I would expect it to get rejected at the bull market support band on weekly closes just like you got rejected over there that would currently correspond to about 053 to 054 again not really my base case um it it has already technically broken support and if you look at the trend over here in 2016 you can see that um after it came back down it it didn't really bounce much at all it just kind of kept on going down so base cases that eth Bitcoin continues to bleed base cases that Bitcoin dominance continues to go up um it's not a monotonic I mean it's not monotonic right it's a stochastic process so please be aware of that um I just think you know whatever happens the next week or two is kind of not that important it's more important what we think about in terms of going into into the summer so you know that is kind of where I am right now as far as Bitcoin you USD and sort of going back to the 8we estimate I I do imagine that if you don't go back to the 8we estimate and you just kind of get a larger drop like that that might cause the dominance to stall out for a little bit um but if you do get a relief rally kind of like what we saw in 2019 back to the 8we SME or even if it's like early 2021 back to the 8we S may I still think that that is where the Bitcoin dominance would go up a lot and if that were to play out then my guess is that you're just going to chop around up here for a little while until the dominance is around 60% and then once the dominance of Bitcoin hits 60% then Bitcoin USD Falls below its bull market support band just like it did over there and might say why 60% uh it's also a valid question there's a lot of different reasons why I think 60% uh the the fluffiest one which is not something I put a lot of weight into and actually I came up with 60% before even seeing this but if you look at the breakdown of Bitcoin dominance over here in 20 uh in the prior cycle from 17 over here you can see it rally back up to the 618 and if you take the breakdown from right here the 618 would actually put you at 60% the other way that I I I think you can look at it is if you look at the Bitcoin dominance excluding Stables onto trading view there's a wedge pattern here and the top of the wedge you know if it were to sort of continue would put it you know at around 64% uh if we just say what about where would it be by June you know you can see it be about 63% or so um or so that's no that's currently that's April if we go to to to June about 64% now it's currently 59% so that's another 5% move well coincidentally the Bitcoin dominance is at 55% so if it moves up 5% that gets you to 60% so I do think that dominance excluding Stables is likely going to go back up to the top of this wedge at which point it might be the top okay another way that you can look at it is to actually add in usdt dominance to the Bitcoin dominance and you will see that it also swept the high uh just like it did over here in 2019 right so you can see that it had a high it swept the high it had one last pullback and then it just went up so we had a high we we swept the high it looks kind of like we're in our pullback right now because the dominance excluded or the dominance of Bitcoin plus the dominance of usdt it went all the way up to around 62% and now it's back down to 60% so I mean it kind of looks like we're we're in this pullback right here but again my guess is that it's ultimately going to find a bottom and go much higher as we get into the summer okay so again you know if you're looking for a reason for why any of these alt coins might bounce against Bitcoin I would look towards something like that but it kind of looks like we've already had a lot of the move down and and altcoins are still not I mean Bitcoin dominance is still holding above 55% so um I don't you know I I I mean it might stall out here for a little bit but I do think it will uh continue to break through through there's a lot of other things that are kind of interesting when you look at Bitcoin USD that could give you some evidence of a potential local top for a little while one of which is if you take the FIB retracement tool from 2017 Peak and over and just sort of take that to the to the to the peak today uh you can see it actually topped out right at the 4.236 if you're like well this is great it's only hindsight guys I did a video like during the week where I pointed this out and and I I pointed it out because I found it interesting not necessarily to say that it you know it it has to be here but that back in 2019 or sorry back in 2021 Bitcoin only rallied back up to the 3618 right so here it rallied up to the 3618 and then it swept the high again it didn't make it to the 4.236 now it has made it to the 4.236 but you want to know what's actually fascinating about this is if you look at at at total market cap and you look at that same retracement tool you can see that in 2021 it made it to the 4.236 when Bitcoin didn't and what's even more fascinating is that now total only made it to the 3618 how crazy is that right so in 2021 Bitcoin was weaker than the altcoin market it only made it to the 3.61 a but in 2024 Bitcoin is stronger than the altcoin market as it went to the 4.236 whereas total only went has so far has only gone to 3618 what's different between here and here what's different between you know 2021 and 2024 monetary policy has changed a lot look at Bitcoin dominance where was Bitcoin dominance over here it was at like 40% and I said I said back in late 2021 early 2022 that Bitcoin dominance is is is entering a macro uptrend and it's likely going to go to 60% um and look at this look look what happened you know 3 years later almost exactly 3 years later at after at least this top here 3 years later Bitcoin is at the same price and the dominance is up from 40% to 55% right so I think you know this would be some evidence right I mean it's at least some evidence to suggest a summer low it doesn't have to happen even last summer I said that we could get a summer lull and I would still argue that it was a summer lull a lot of you guys might not remember it as such but when you think about it when we when we talked about a summer lull in I believe April um I mean it bled until June and then it I mean it literally got a one week pump for the most part and then it just bled again until September so I mean to me that is a summer L right I mean not a lot happened the market was relatively boring I think the market could very well be boring this summer as well so that's you know some more evidence of it the main thing that I go back to is you know there's there's three things and we've talked about a lot of them we talking about them forever so unless you're new here you should already know what I'm going to say we know that in 2019 there was two things that marked the top that marked the transition from risk on to risk off one was the the breakdown of eth Bitcoin and again it was it was one of the sources of liquidity and it and it got taken away to some degree as eth Bitcoin broke down and when eth Bitcoin broke broke down it marked a local top by Bitcoin so here you're looking at a very similar thing where eth Bitcoin is breaking down and it potentially marked a local top for Bitcoin it's not just eth Bitcoin though it's also gold if you look at gold if you overlay gold onto this chart you will see basically the same thing when did Bitcoin go from risk on to risk offl back in 2019 it was actually exactly when gold broke out right you see gold right here it broke about above these prior highs that marked the the top for Bitcoin and when did gold break out it didn't break out in April it actually broke out in March precisely basically when Bitcoin is put in its local top which also is about a month before the having which is when eth topped out about a month before the merge now of course eth continued to go higher later on but it had a period where it it it cooled off quite a lot going into the next few months so that that's more evidence and then of course the other one that we've talked about is usdt dominance if you look at usdt dominance take a look at this trend line I've been pointing it out forever as well um I did a whole video on usdt dominance back over here and I said look there's a good chance it's going to go from 6% down to 4% and it did and it's was accompanied by continued Bitcoin rally but the issue is that with usdt dominance is that every time it has hit this line it has marked a larger pullback in the market it marked a larger pullback starting in December 2017 even in November 2018 it was just before Bitcoin dropped quite a bit June 2019 was the the midcycle top back in the last cycle right before rate Cuts began February 2020 I shouldn't explained that one March 2021 November 2021 March 2024 and we hit this trend line again now where we you know where you you might get potentially thrown off is in March of 2021 we hit this trend line and we kind of kept tagging it throughout April and even into May so if you were to get some type of relief bounce you you could actually see us go tag that trend line again but I you know every single time we've tagged this trend line we had to see sort of a a a reallocation of capital for a while where people took profits there was a lull in the market and then after kind of consolidating there for a while um we saw USD Dom start to go back up and there's actually a similar Trend right if you look at the bullmark sport band you'll see a lot of times there's this like there's this move where you you you sort of go down you go back up get rejected by the 20 we and then you go back down to it right here you go down you go back up get rejected by the 20we SMA and then you go down to it same thing go down go back up get rejected by the 20we SMA and then you go back down to the trend line so we've seen this happen many many times now the next question you might have is why are you only looking at usdt dominance why not look at usdt dominance as well it's a fair question and so we'll just add it in and you can see that if you add that in it gives you basically the same thing I mean it's kind of a rounding error I mean qualitatively it's the same thing so I think maybe this is the area to look at right here because it is now at the bull market support band um so I mean it depends on if it breaks through or not if you get a relief rally back up to the 8we SMA then it would be a rejection off this in the short term if you don't get a relief rally back up to 8we estim and it just plays out like November late November 2021 and you say go straight back down to the bullmark SM band or something then then it just then the USD dominance just sort of breaks through so a lot of things to consider and by the way in in um in this entire bull market all these pullbacks have only been about 20 to 22% pullbacks right so 20% pullback 20% pullback right all of these have been 20% pullbacks and so you know there's going to be some people right that are going to think that it's just going to be another 20% pullback which means that you know if you do see it at 58k 59k I'm sure people are going to bid it up because this what they been doing and they could be right right I maybe that's what leads to a relief rally in the market but note that when eth Bitcoin broke down in 2019 it finally led to a larger drop in the market to the tune of 30% and really the market had dropped before that relief rally occurred had dropped around 34% which was much more significant than any of the other drops that had currently seen about 18% um you know 14% so I mean you know what happens if it plays out like late 2021 where you don't really get a relief rally and it just goes back down to the bull market sport band I mean if you get something like that you know a a 30 a a 26% drop gets you back to the bull market sport band right the problem is that normally when you go this long without testing it you could argue that we're too far gone to hold it as support and therefore you get a summer lull right you get this period where it just sort of goes back below it it happened there it also happened back over here and you can see here it took 24 weeks to get to the back to the below the 20we estim here it took 32 weeks we are currently on week 26 so we are in between this one and this one I've said before I think this move here is a combination of this one and this one because 2019 was during quantitative tightening and high rates the secondary move over here was during QE we put in a new all-time high though so just kind of like over here we put in a new alltime high so a lot of different things right you can look at um to sort of look at this move and the the reason why I I still remain very you know pessimistic about all Bitcoin pairs is because if you look at at 2019 during this period right here that's where all Bitcoin pairs mostly put in their bottoms it was when you know Bitcoin kind of chopped around for a little bit during this phase and so if it does something like that then I think all Bitcoin pairs might bottom out somewhere in that in that range right somewhere in that zone as as Bitcoin just continues to chop the altcoin market up for a few months I think that's where you might actually see altcoins bottom against Bitcoin um at least the ones that are going to and and Bitcoin dominance top out but I think we're too early in this trend for that to be the case just yet I think that the the Bitcoin is going to continue to chop the altcoin market up for probably at least another month or two um before that is the case and you know I do think there's a lot of evidence who support that as I've been talking about quite expensively in this video if you look at individual altcoins they really mimic that 2019 move a lot more than they would the 2020 move I mean there's a lot of great examples of that if you look just at ethereum if you just look at eth and I did a whole video on this previously but you kind of have this this wedge here and it it looks like it's playing out in a very similar fashion right where you have this wedge you break above it and then after eth Bitcoin breaks down eth you USD falls back through the wedge so eth Bitcoin broke down right here after it broke down eth USD fell through the wedge eth Bitcoin just broke down here and now it looks like ethusd is potentially falling into the wedge it doesn't mean you can't get a relief rally and a lower high but I do think there's a case we made that it's going to go back into that wedge um and if you look at other altcoins that are even riskier you have things like Ada and if you look at this one I mean this move does look very similar at least at this point to this one right here right I mean if you look closely I mean it it almost looks like a a carbon copy of this sort of this double you know this double Peak move right here if you just sort of overlay it you can see it it I mean it looks really really similar and when Ada USD was falling right there it also happened to correspond to when adaa Bitcoin was breaking support right Ada Bitcoin broke support right there which is when a a USD capitulated back down to the range low right here if you look at it over here you can see that ADA Bitcoin broke support right here which is precisely when Ada USD capitulated back to the range low right there so it's all very similar right it's all very similar the main difference this time is that rate cuts are occurring basically a year later than they occurred in the prior cycle it doesn't mean that it's not playing out it just is taking a long time for us to see the whole thing play out but it's there right I mean it is there if you look for it um I I do feel like you can see it playing out and the reality is that the altcoin Reckoning was always based on all Bitcoin valuations and if and if e Bitcoin is putting in new lows which it is and if Ada Bitcoin is putting in new lows which it is this is a trend line that everyone said was going to hold my loudest critics in the cardano community told me that I was clueless for saying that adaa Bitcoin would go below 800 sets because they said this trend line was going to hold and I said many many times it's not going to hold and it's nothing against them it's nothing against cardano it's just monetary policy right I mean don't take it up with me go take it up with Jerome Powell it's just monetary policy and you can see that it has fallen below it and it's probably going to go to 400 stats um dot Bitcoin is putting in new lows right and the reality madic Bitcoin you know putting in new lows the reality if if all these altcoins are putting in new lows and the altcoin Reckoning was about the devaluation of altcoins against Bitcoin then it means the altcoin Reckoning is not over if all these alts are putting in new lows so that's where we are right and you know the the tough less than learned last cycle was that if alt Bitcoin pairs can put in new lows alt USD pairs can put in new lows I I saw that happen with many altcoins last cycle so don't tell me it can't happen it can I saw it happen last cycle if you have a problem with that just go look at what happened last cycle with a lot of altcoins Bitcoin has the luxury it is so much higher up than the altcoin market right I mean it could drop right it could drop from here could drop 65% and be at 25k which is still well above the prior low right what happens if if eth drops 65% it's still going to be above the prior low but you're not that much further above it right I mean you're you're at $1,400 right which would actually look very similar to this one right here where ethusd fell back to slightly above this higher low right so you had a low and then a higher low here you have a low and then a higher low right I mean it would it would get you sort of close to that range um where it found this low a little bit higher than that right right around $1,400 right so kind of looks really similar right it kind of looks really similar and but the issue is that in the altcoin market you can't say the same because if if if something like a were to drop 65% from these highs it's back down to the lows and the issue for Ada is that it's bleeding on his Bitcoin pair so if Bitcoin were to drop 65% then Ada is probably down 80% so that's how altcoins can put in new lows after you know once rate Cuts arrive or even you know because they they're already not even that far off their lows so if you get a more substantial correction on bitcoin whether it's 65% you know whether it's 57% or whether it's a more minor correction alt can put in new lows because they're not that far off their lows to begin with if you were to look at like madic I mean is it is it really that far off its low I mean it would only be a 55% drop just to get it back to its low there's just so many things that you can look at that that show very clearly why the altcoin market has been so risky compared to bitcoin it doesn't mean that some haven't outperformed I said that two years ago I I said it 2 and a half years ago that some out for Bitcoin even though Bitcoin dominance is going to go up and that's exactly what happened and every single day I have messages from people saying you know you said not to buy alts and this altcoin outperform Bitcoin you know they would have been some micro cap meme coin can go yeah sure it can outperform Bitcoin most of the coins from last cycle are still putting in lower highs against Bitcoin that's the fact that's the fact so I stand by it I mean I stand by it it it was not wrong to be bullish on bitcoin dominance it was not wrong to be bearish on E Bitcoin it wasn't wrong to be bearish on any Bitcoin or any of these altcoins against Bitcoin for the most part the ones that people point to are they're cherry-picking the low because most of them are still putting in lower highs against Bitcoin and the ones that are not for the most part are new altcoins that don't have the baggage from the prior cycle which by the way is what I said would happen that the ones that are likely going to go up against Bitcoin are going to be your newer altcoins that don't have that baggage now that we look back on it after all this time and you're looking at a 62 ,000 Bitcoin and everyone is scared it's only 62k I mean it could drop I mean even if it were to Rally back up to the 8we SMA or even go above it I mean it could drop all the way back down here and it's still doing pretty well all things considered I mean imagine you know if you bought Bitcoin in late 2022 which by the way on ITC premium I said I was doing despite what anyone wants to say receipts are there even if it were to drop back to 42k you're still up 164% now the people that bought it up here would be pissed off because they're down 44% but you're still doing well the issue is that was there ever a time where it would have been made more sense being in in a collective basket of altcoins over Bitcoin in that case and and I would say no because if Bitcoin were to drop back down here let's say 58% you know where's total three where would total three be I mean 58% puts you back at the lows right it just simply puts you back at the lows that's the issue for the altcoin market is that Bitcoin has the luxury of getting a larger pullback and still being pretty you know up a lot the altcoin market doesn't have that same luxury and that's how altcoins can put in new lows you might say well this time is different guys we saw the altcoin market put in new lows in the having year last cycle now it was induced by a pandemic but at the end of the day it was a recession and you can't tell me there's no risk of that I'm not saying it has to happen you could have a soft Landing but we've had an inverted yiel curve for an extremely long period of time and it could theoretically happen the unemployment rate is curling up in fact if you go look at the unemployment rate anytime it goes above the bullmark S band for the most part I mean it's just it just keeps on going up right and we're above it I mean look at all these times I have them highlighted so it could happen it doesn't have to be induced by by a pandemic but maybe it's just induced by you know 2 and a half years of of Tighter and Tighter monetary policy um so that's how it could theoretically happen and I saw it happen last cycle you know I don't care what the excuse was you know at the end of the day you're always going to come up with a reason like why doesn't matter if it was caused by a pandemic all that mattered was that I DC into altcoins throughout this entire phase and I would have just been better off with Bitcoin that was the reality of the situation I can blame it on whatever the hell I want to blame it on but the reality was that I could have just been with stuck with Bitcoin and I would have been much better off there was never a time where it made sense to be in the collective altcoin Market over Bitcoin basically throughout this entire phase but then once QE came back and the last rate cut arrived then you bet your sweet you know what it made sense to be bullish on the eth Bitcoin valuation which I was which I was and actually I turned bullish on the E Bitcoin valuation at 0.02 in 2019 which is where it ultimately carved out of bottom but that's why I say I mean it's really not that complicated if if you're bullish on bitcoin dominance three of the four years in the cycle you're probably doing something right altcoins really only durably rally against Bitcoin for like one year of the cycle look at Bitcoin dominance really I mean look at look at Bitcoin dominance and you look to see when these all seasons occur where Bitcoin dominance is crashing it it really only lasts about a year and then we spend the next three years dreaming of va season right it lasts for about a year and then you spend the next three years dreaming of va season and then by the time that I convince the last of you that the Bitcoin dominance is likely going to 60% that's when it finally tops out when the last person capitulates their alt to bitcoin when the last person stops telling me that eth is holding up well against Bitcoin because it's not and it hasn't been then every time I say that it's going lower I get trolls all over X telling me why I'm wrong and they've been bullish on it for the last 2 and 1/2 years it's easy to call the bottom on something over and over and over again because eventually you will be right and it's not cool to be bullish on bitcoin dominance when most people here only care about altcoins so what they do is they just keep on calling the bottom on it on each Bitcoin and they keep calling the top on bitcoin dominance day after day after day they laugh at anyone who disagrees with them and then when it when when Bitcoin dominance goes up they call the top on it again when e Bitcoin goes down they call the bottom on it again they'll eventually be right my guess is they're going to be right when we go to 03 to 04 for E Bitcoin my guesses are going to be right when we go to 60% Bitcoin dominance and that I think is ultimately where the top for Bitcoin dominance could be one crazy thing about this is if you add in usdt dominance you will see that we're not that far off of where we were back over here I mean back over here when we broke the Range High was at 64% here it's at like 62% ultimately what happened after that is that you know from here it would rally up all the way up to 75% right maybe it goes a little bit lower 73% this is both Bitcoin dominance and usct dominance but you can see like it's not we could get there if you were to look at Bitcoin dominance plus eth dominance look at this it's an oscillator because it doesn't matter how many tens of thousands of mem coins you print there's no more money coming into them the money is just being diverted from one meme coin to 10,000 so dominance isn't going to go down just because you print another 10,000 meme coins it just means that each meme coin is going to become a little less relevant because there's so many more of them so blue chip dominance is an oscillator where it goes basically between 58 57% up to around 79 80% and right now it's around 72% I think it's going to go all the way up here here to around 80% meaning another 8% move by Bitcoin plus eth dominance that's my guess about another 8% move or so it doesn't have to be quite that high I could see a case um where you have slightly lower highs um but I I still think it's it's going to go it's going to make a run here um so that would be something to look at as well and again if you look at like all Bitcoin pairs the only not really sure if it's going to see any more relief from here or not if they do my guess is they get rejected off of the bullmark sport pen right so you can see right here they had this sort of this relief move back up before getting rejected and going down um off the bullmark sport ban You could argue we already had that move although it did go above the 20we estimate so I'm not really that sure um again if it were to do something like this it would it would correspond to the the the Bitcoin dominance plus usdt do sort of getting getting this pull back before going up right but again this cycle we've seen things not as um you know they haven't been as spectacular in fact if you were to get a bar pattern of this it might actually be interesting to Overlay this and and you compress it right so if you kind of like compress it down it would you know it would look something like that right I might need to even compress it a little bit more um but it would look something like that where you're sort of you're in the pullback right now where maybe it goes down a little bit more but then I I think it just shoots up into into the summer you know and again trying to think about what would cause it to go down I again I I I do wonder if if a larger pullback by Bitcoin would cause it to go down um but I mean even that doesn't really make a whole lot of sense because this is usdt dominance so if Bitcoin goes down then usdt dominance is theoretically going up so it could be theoretically a Bitcoin bounce where altcoins outperform but again that's not really my base case and if they do outperform I I think it would be extremely short-lived because in 2019 during High interest rates and quantitative tightening on the relief rally Bitcoin dominance went up not down so that's my base case is that all Bitcoin pairs break down Bitcoin dominance breaks up into the summer months um potentially topping out in maybe June or July you know around the maybe around the First Rate cut I don't know exactly but um this whole process has been taking a lot longer than I thought so I'm not going to you know say for sure when I think it's going to top out but I do think it's ultimately going to go um up a little bit more um probably up to you know this is you know Bitcoin dominance plus usdt dominance probably up to you know 74 75% as a high but I I could see it not going that High I mean I could see it going only to like 70% or something this is with this is not just Bitcoin dominance this is also usdt dominance remember so if you add in if you just look at usdt dominance it's currently at you know 5% it it was at 4% not that long ago so I mean if it were to go back up to 8% or something right I mean that's a 3% that you're adding on to bitcoin dominance is 5% that gets you 8% um and that can kind of get you there so definitely lot of things to think about Bitcoin having is coming up really soon so if the Bulls are going to get above the 8we ese this week it's got to be because the they bid it up into the having they haven't been able to do that so far and so if they can't do it by the end of the week and we do get that Weekly close below the 8we ese I I think that next week is the key week to look at because you either get this rally like early 2021 or early or mid 2019 back to the 8we or you just don't get it and it just can you know just capitulates again into a pretty large a pretty large drop and if it were to get something like that then you would essentially find yourself back at the at the bull Mark support band at around 53 54k or so so that's what I'm essentially looking at right now um there's a thousand different other things we could we could think about and and I mean I could of course tie it into to the long of the yield curve um to the dollar the dollar is in a rally I said going into the I said many times going into the summer I think this is going to form a higher low and go higher into the summer the reason that's an issue for alts is because as liquidity gets sort of taken out as as the dollar goes up you get the devaluation of other currencies against the US dollar the personing power goes down all it's bleed to bitcoin highrisk assets bleed to lowrisk assets during this dxy rally over here we saw the Bitcoin dominance go up a lot and I'm guessing we're just going to see the same thing happen once again so those are my views on on bitcoin right now I I mean I I I suppose it's always worthwhile to to look at at other things like for instance uh year-to-date Roi of Bitcoin in 2024 compared to say 20121 and um and 2017 and kind of see that I mean if you look at at 29 or at um 2021 since we were making that comparison I mean you can kind of see some similarities here um and so let's see if it if it gets that sort of a lower high in May or not uh because if it does get that if it gets a lower high in May then it might sort of make people think all right we are in fact getting a a summer low the biggest case to suggest that I'm wrong would be that if we are getting a a left translated cycle um where we just kind of keep rallying on up into the summer again it's not my based case uh it really isn't but there's a lot of people that are talking about it still and um who am I to say that it can't happen if you take the ROI from the peak measured it from April instead of November you can see that we are kind of right where we were at this point last cycle so I wouldn't completely dismiss that view you might say well Ben that goes against everything you just said guess what I don't trade everything I just said I've just been Bitcoin heavy for a long time I converted my alts to Bitcoin in early 2022 I converted my e to Bitcoin in 2022 between mostly 07 to 8 and some a little above 8 and I bought Bitcoin at the lows with USD as published in ITC premium that's what I did I sold a little bit of Bitcoin in 24 that's what I I sold some Bitcoin in 2024 as I mentioned but I didn't sell any in 2023 so how do you navigate it if you get a left translated top well I mean you have some Bitcoin right I mean because guess what no matter what happens Bitcoin dominance goes up it gives you exposure to the upside it minimizes your downside risk that's the view that's been the view for like the last two and a half years it gives you exposure to the upside it minimizes your downside risk it doesn't mean that Bitcoin is not going to crash at some point it probably will in fact if you go look at the days since the last time Bitcoin had a drop um since it had a 30% drop I mean it's been 526 days I mean come on guys it's going to drop 30% at some point it's been a long time it's probably going to happen and and when it does um everyone's going to act like they could have never seen it coming you know but it's been a long time since it happened um and I mean it sort of seems like like we're getting close to one um but again that doesn't mean it has to materialize immediately you could see some relief here and there I just think that no matter what happens going into the summer the Bitcoin dominance goes up whether it means bitcoin's going down or up there's a good chance it's doing both right there's a good chance it's going up and down and sort of chopping around for a while and the altcoins get eaten alive by Bitcoin they just because they can't catch a B during such monetary policy and there's so many of them that the money gets spread out it's too thin the order books are too thin so when Bitcoin sells off the altcoin market because they broke down in their Bitcoin pairs during Bitcoin rallies they have nowhere to hide when Bitcoin dumps so you have to think about a lot of those different things um as you navigate this market for me it has always been a Bitcoin heavy portfolio make sure you keep some cash in case in case you know something really bad happens and or or if it just plays out like 2019 where it it sort of just finds a local top and we just sort of slowly Trend down for a while right I think it's worthwh to have some cash if that happens um and the way you can be hedged is you could also have some Bitcoin in case I'm wrong and and I have some Bitcoin in case I'm wrong right I mean it I I think a lot of people forget that right and I've said that for years but I put out views about what I think I have some Bitcoin in case I'm wrong wrong because you know if Bitcoin goes to 100K I'm going to be sad I didn't have more but at least I had some but again I'm going to express my views those are my views e Bitcoin broke down gold broke out the main thing that is providing me a little hesitation is that all Bitcoin pairs still haven't technically broken down and so I'm not really sure if that means there's still that more liquidity that Bitcoin can take from the altcoin market but that is something to keep an eye on they still haven't technically broken down and so that still I think theoretically needs to happen but anyways we'll go ahead and wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at inth crypt.of",Youtube video,2024-04-17 00:00:00,"The video discusses the technical analysis of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, and provides insights into potential market movements going forward. The key points are:The video examines the behavior of the 8-week exponential moving average (8WE SMA) and its significance as a support level for Bitcoin. It explores historical patterns where Bitcoin has fallen below the 8WE SMA and the subsequent market reactions, drawing comparisons to 2019 and 2021. The analysis suggests that a weekly close below the 8WE SMA could lead to a relief rally, but the behavior of the Ethereum-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair during such rallies in the past indicates that ETH/BTC may continue to decline, similar to 2019, rather than experiencing a significant rally. This is attributed to the current monetary policy environment, which is in a tightening phase, in contrast to the expansionary policies during the 2021 rally.The video also discusses the potential for Bitcoin dominance to continue its upward trend, potentially reaching new highs, before eventually topping out and pulling back, similar to the patterns observed in previous cycles. The presenter provides several technical and fundamental reasons to support this view, including the relationship between Bitcoin dominance, the Ethereum-Bitcoin pair, and the overall market conditions. The presenter cautions against relying too heavily on these predictions and advises viewers to develop their own strategies based on their own research and risk tolerance.Additionally, the video explores the potential for a summer lull in the cryptocurrency market, similar to the patterns observed in 2019 and 2021. The presenter suggests that the current monetary policy environment, characterized by tightening, could lead to a period of consolidation and a potential bottom for the Ethereum-Bitcoin pair in the June-July timeframe.The main message and conclusion of the video is that the current market conditions, particularly the monetary policy environment, suggest a potential for continued Bitcoin dominance and a challenging environment for altcoins, with the possibility of a summer lull and a potential bottom for the Ethereum-Bitcoin pair in the June-July timeframe. The presenter emphasizes the importance of developing one's own strategies based on individual research and risk tolerance, rather than relying too heavily on the specific predictions made in the video.",458,"[0.031951904, 0.013008118, -0.0025424957, -0.0062828064, 0.017501831, -0.007904053, 0.024902344, -0.02835083, -0.042877197, 0.00028777122, 0.018371582, 0.016189575, -0.027282715,

Hi, the eth Bitcoin ratio has fallen if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom links in the description below we have a website with thousands of charts for hundreds of different cryptocurrencies so make sure you guys check that out again the sale will end at after the having let's go Ahad and jump in so the eth Bitcoin ratio is something that I have been tracking about as long as my channel has been around I find the eth Bitcoin ratio really useful in terms of navigating various phases of the market cycle if you have an edge on where you think think e Bitcoin on where e Bitcoin is going to go then theoretically you have an edge on where then Bitcoin dominance is going to go and how to adjust your portfolio to maximize your risk adjusted returns we have just had a major event happen in the cryptoverse but I think it is largely gone unnoticed so far but I do think it will become more evident in the coming weeks so this video is going to first go through the eth Bitcoin ratio and my prior views on it we will then talk about the implications on you know the USD valuation of eth and then finally I will talk a little bit about a potential path for eth Bitcoin to finally bottom out so before we get too far into this you know one of the things that inevitably happens when I post these videos is you know the the Bitcoin Maxi talk comes out they just say oh he's just a Bitcoin Maxi but let me just go through you know a few of my prior thoughts in the video are on on on eth bitcoin so I actually the the first video you will find on my channel the first two in fact are primarily on the eth Bitcoin valuation here's one here's the first one this is the oldest video on my channel e ethereum timing the longterm momentum shifts we are in a very strong by region so so in the video I talk about how eth Bitcoin was significantly undervalued at 02 and that it was a strong by region and that we were likely going to spend the next sever several years seeing the eth Bitcoin valuation go up I Then followed it up in my next video where I said it I just made the title eth Bitcoin is severely undervalued you can see that right before ethereum takes off you know at least in the last cycle it likes to hug this 20we moving average for a bit and that's what we're so we were making all the same comparisons for the prior cycle and talking about how it was likely going to enter into a major uptrend so it's important for me to say this because inevitably whenever I post a video on the eth Bitcoin valuation what people will say is that zoom out you know and and look at the chart and and they sort of point out these higher lows and my only point you know is that it's a market right and yes I was I was bullish on it over here but just like anything in the market nothing ever goes straight up straight up nothing goes straight down it's okay to Pivot your view if the market changes and so then I pivoted my view when we started to notice that ethereum's Bitcoin valuation was looking awfully similar similar to the Bitcoin USD woff distribution so why are we talking about this well the problem is that you could argue the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is so is showing some similarities right these so we talk about how the eth Bitcoin valuation was showing similarities to the Bitcoin USD wof distribution woff distribution and this was when it was at 073 now after that we saw it collapse all the way down 2.05 this collapse is actually a very common collapse that happens between two major Peaks so if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about look at the eth Bitcoin valuations weekly candles and you will see a very familiar pattern that has happened now a third time and is in the process of of still happening and that pattern namely is that you get a Peak you then set a low you then get a slightly lower high you then come back down to the low spend some months trying to hold it as support but ultimately you fail and then we go into final capitulation that lasts for two or three months you will see the same thing happened over here you set a peak you set a low then you set a secondary Peak where it is a lower high you come back down to the low you try to hold it for a few months but you fail to and then you capitulate for two to three months before setting the bottom the same thing has happened once again where you have a peak you set a low you then set a secondary Peak that's a lower high you then bleed back down to the low and you try to hold it for a few months but you fail and then you bleed below that that low and then you capitulate for a few months this is the general Trend the general path that the eth Bitcoin valuation takes and so in this video when we talked about this this distribution phase what ended up happening is we did go back down we went down we set a low then we went right back up to set a secondary distribution phase we can see similarities in these two charts for instance you not only do you have the wof distribution phase but you also have this this potential double top that's occurr so we talked about how the E Bitcoin valuation back then was essentially mimicking the Bitcoin USD secondary distribution phase where it had a double top in late 2021 right so you can see that it had these four tops and then a double top over here sort of your one two p and then it bled back down to the range lows tried to hold it and then once it failed to hold it it capitulated and we said back then that it looks like the same thing is happening where eth Bitcoin had a secondary distribution phase right you had your first distribution phase here and then a secondary distribution phase up here where you have your little one2 top bleed back down to the range lows and then finally capitulate just like Bitcoin USD capitulated here in June of 2022 so this whole process that we've been talking about has been playing out but it's been playing out over a very long period of time so we started off with saying timing this long-term momentum shift at at at 0.02 saying it's severely undervalued at 0.0019 or whatever it was at here then acknowledging look it looks like a distribution phase up at Point 73 and then at the merge when it was at 0083 saying look this looks to be like a secondary distribution phase do you guys remember what it was like at the merge all the eth Maxis were calling for the flipping some of them were calling for it to double up bitcoin's market cap it was absolutely delusional right and every step of the way I mean every throughout this entire process we've seen nothing but lower high after lower high and every time that it happens it draws more people back in it leads to a lot of like taunting and mocking but they've all just been lower highs right they've all just been lower highs and now after watching eth Bitcoin bleed for two and a half years from this high it has finally broken support this is a major milestone in the crypto verse for those who care to pay attention to it I wish I had paid closer attention to it in Prior Cycles now there's something we have to talk about here okay and that is what are the implications of it going forward and what are the implications of it on its USD valuation because while I have tried to spend hours and hours and hours convincing people that the Bitcoin valuation of these cryptocurrencies is the only thing that matters I've failed at convincing everyone and so a lot of people still do care about its USD evaluation and I'm not going to necessarily I mean I will provide my opinion but I'm just going to show you what happened the last two times that e Bitcoin closed below this major support level it's happened twice before okay it happened here in November of October of 2016 October November of 2016 and then it happened over here in June July of 2019 so it's happened two times before what did ethusd do during that time so if you were to Overlay ethusd onto this chart what we're going to do is just say what did it do after the breakdown occurred okay So Below when it when it went first below the range low from this Wick right here so you can see that it went below the range low in October of 2016 if we zoom in we can maybe see it a little bit closer so you can see it right right here it went below the range low in October of 2016 when it went below the range low in October of 2016 you can see that October was down 18% November it was down 21.5% and then December it went down 5. 6% by the week by the monthly close however the whole move here from October through December Sal ethusd dropped 54% 54% all right that's one example now following that drop we know what happened next right this is one example by the way in this example when ethusd dropped Bitcoin actually went up if you were to Overlay Bitcoin USD onto this chart you'll see that Bitcoin didn't really care about what eth was doing during that time it just went up okay now look at the second time this happened where eth Bitcoin fell below support it happened in July of 2019 now what happened to ethusd starting then well you can see that on this USD pair at dropped out 1 month before and then it bled down 75% now I know what you're thinking that was a pandemic drop that caused it to drop 75% I would say it gives you insight into what could happen if a recession occurs right regardless of what triggers it whether it's a Black Swan or whether it's just a slow long progression of the yield curve and all that stuff if we ignore that let's just suppose we get a landing and there's no recession right which is a big assumption but let's just for a minute suppose that that's true even in that case even before the pandemic was a thing eth still dropped 68% from the highs when eth Bitcoin broke down so you have two examples of eth breaking down and really measured from this top here in September it actually dropped around 60% so you have two examples where when eth Bitcoin broke down as measured from the previous local top on ethusd eth dropped 60% if you actually take it from this top over here you can see it was closer to a 72% drop and this one remember was about a 75% drop so what do you notice when eth Bitcoin breaks down it has never been good for ethusd even when Bitcoin went up now in the second case over here Bitcoin actually went down right so so in this case Bitcoin went down in 2019 in 2016 Bitcoin went up so what does that show you it shows you that no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD Bitcoin dominance went up during those times and eth Bitcoin went down e Bitcoin went down and so the question is is what does that mean this time because so many people out there right and I I it's almost scary how how how many people are saying it right so many people out there are Shilling memes and and outright scams and they're being paid to do it and they do it over and over and over again and their followers follow them and they get wrecked and then they just keep on doing it because there's always some other 100x gem that they're going to recommend that they were paid to recommend okay now for a while people just assume it's okay and that nothing is nothing bad is happening but this is a major event that eth Bitcoin has fallen it's a major event and I think not enough people are are paying attention to it they're focused on other things they're focused on the the latest meme coin craze they're rationalizing why their altcoins are down 30 to 40% over the last couple of weeks this is a major event I know it's a meme guy I me get it I get it but if you look at the logarithmic regression trend line for eth fit to to non-bubble data you will see that after eth Bitcoin broke down here and here eusd went to the lower logarithmic regression trend line or home if you will that's what happened and I can't help but wonder why should this time be any different because as we saw over here eth USD dropped from the local high 72% over here even if you don't worry about the pandemic it still dropped about 66 67% if you include the recession 73 or 72% or so if you take this from here from 4K a 70% drop puts you exactly at the fair value logarithmic aggression trend line that's where it would put ethereum and I don't know why we should assume this time is any different one thing to consider is that you know I know a lot of people are talking about a left translated cycle and so as I've said before I'm not completely unsympathetic to that view I'm not but I don't for for me I still think if you want exposure to crypto I I think Bitcoin makes more sense than ethereum right now now that doesn't mean that Bitcoin can't collapse I think it probably will get a pretty big drop um at at some point especially as as the yield curve un inverts but I don't know exactly when that's going to be um we do know that last cycle Bitcoin topped out about a month before the First Rate cut I know the First Rate cut is getting priced further and further out but I think that the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to get priced back in I've explained what I mean by that before I really want to spend a ton of time explaining that again so ethusd potentially is starting to turn the corner here and what's actually fascinating about ethusd when you look at it on its USD pair when it broke down against Bitcoin last time the pattern is almost identical we have this wedge that ethusd broke out of right we have this wedge ethusd broke out of it topped eth Bitcoin broke down right there eth USD then fell back through the wedge right it fell back through the wedge now look at it over here it's the same thing you have a wedge that ethusd was in for a long time and now eth Bitcoin has broken down ethusd is starting to correct and it looks like it's potentially going to correct right through the wedge just like it did over here which by the way occurred as those rate Cuts finally arrived so I don't really care what the CME Market tool thing is is showing for when rate cuts are going to occur I look at this and say if this keeps on dropping like this it represents a consumer that is starting to falter and therefore it will likely not take until November or September for a rate cut I could see a rate cut coming this Summer Okay so this pattern to me looks like it's playing out once again I have said forever that after eth Bitcoin breaks down we will likely see ethusd fall back through this wedge to me it looks like it is finally happening so I think that it makes a lot of sense to view the market view ethusd through the lens of eth Bitcoin and the reason for that is over the last two and a half years if you wanted exposure to crypto then you have to figure out what you're going to buy and of course if you're if you're a full Deen and you're you're buying micro cap stuff you're probably not really interested in what I have to say anyways but if you're not as risky if you don't want to take on as much risk um if you're dealing with say a significant amount of money um a large percentage of your of your funds are going into high you know some of these risky assets and you don't want to speculate too much out of the top you know top cup two or three maybe the top 10 then understanding these patterns are I think very important to navigate the cryptoverse in a successful way and so over the last two and a half years if you wanted exposure to crypto and you decided what do you want to buy do you want to buy Bitcoin or eth my view for the last two and a half years is that Bitcoin is the better play because it will likely hit new all-time highs first which it did it will likely not be subject to as much regulation risk as ethereum and also guess what during quantitative tightening e Bitcoin bleeds and it's as simple as that and you know I've seen all sorts of narratives out there that are saying that well proof of stake has failed or that you know there's all these other things there's no evidence of that yet actually there really isn't this is all just monetary policy stuff there's no evidence of any of that yet I think Bitcoin has stood the test of time well and I hope that ethereum does but everything that you've seen happen since November 202 1 is an artifact of monetary policy nothing more so it might lead people to believe that proof of stake is failing when in reality it's just an artifact of tighter monetary policy which is exactly what we saw last cycle in fact during quantitative tightening last cycle we saw the eth Bitcoin valuation bleed in fact if you were to Overlay Bitcoin USD onto this chart you will find that we had a bull market in 2019 and during that bull market Bitcoin did not put in a new high but eth Bitcoin went down because the Fed was still doing quantitative tightening what marked the bottom for eth Bitcoin what marked the bottom it was precisely when the fed pivoted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing that was the bottom it wasn't any more complicated than that it wasn't the narratives that you could have come up with back then it had nothing to do with what some YouTuber was saying about whether it was going to just go to zero or something all it had to do was was was the FED printing money or not was the FED reducing the size of the balance sheet or were they increasing the size of the balance sheet that's what it came down to and once again everyone's trying to over complicate it and come up with a thous different narratives for why it's happening and I said a long time ago that this was what's going to happen when it breaks down people will find a reason and of course the reason that people are looking at is regulation risk which is what we said a long time ago some of the reg regulation news that we've seen recently and also the potential rejection of the spot ETF for ethereum none of that stuff matters none of it matters ethereum has been fine without a spot ETF forever it's not going to die if it if it's rejected I think ethereum's valuation against the US dollar is going down but not because of the spot ETF eth went to $4,800 without a spot ETF I think eth USD is going to go down because eth Bitcoin has broken support it is broken below the June 2022 low and that is the important thing to consider you know if you if you don't follow it too closely we can look very closely at it here the low in June of 2022 for eth Bitcoin was 0.409 so if you draw a line across the page at 0409 so we're going to get a line here 040 well let me get it exact right here there you have it 0049 that was the low and what I said was that we will get a weekly close below the range low and when we do that is when ethereum finally starts to go down on its USD valuation and you can see eth Bitcoin is capitulating below the range low ethusd is starting to capitulate as well last cycle the first month that ethusd fell after e Bitcoin topped a 25% drop by the monthly close a 25% drop by the monthly close for eth this time would put it at around 2700 give or take a 100 or so you know because I didn't really get that accurate there about 27 let's just say 27 2800 something like that 26 2800 because it's not going to be exact anyways just because it was 25 here doesn't mean it has to be 25 here but then where it became brutal was while a lot of people assumed that it would be a buy the dip opportunity the following month after eth Bitcoin broke down it dropped another 21% right so imagine if ethusd first drops that 25% to get it down to 2700 and then drops another 21% from there where does that put e coincidentally it puts it at $2,000 right at 2K and what you'll notice is after it had this drop it then tried to hold that as support for a little while right and that support level that it tried to hold was also the the resistance level back over here it was the resistance level this resistance level was 2K right so my guess is that this summer and probably as maybe even as soon as May in fact May or June I think we will see there's a there's a high likelihood we will see eth at 2K if I'm wrong it's because Bitcoin is getting some type of left translated cycle and it's just dragging eth up with it right and in that case case while technically I would be wrong about about ethusd you would still be better off with Bitcoin than ethereum okay I wish I had known this stuff in Prior Cycles it's not like anyone told me I learned the hard way and I was hoping to help other people not go through that and that's why I've been talking about the Bitcoin dominance forever and all Bitcoin pairs forever so 2K is the level that I think eth is going to correct down to after the Bitcoin having from there it will probably try to hold it as support is my guess but I also think that it will fail to hold it as support and I do think it will eventually go to the lower logarithmic regression trend line if you look at a lot of these bottoming processes for ethereum what you'll notice notice is that it doesn't just tend to put in one low and then never revisit it right you can see over here it put in a low and then it got pretty close to testing it a while later if you just look at monthly closes you can see that these monthly closes we eventually Wicked below the monthly closes you can see over here these monthly closes we eventually went below them right so once again I think eth will eventually go back below these levels and and go back to the lower logarithmic regression trend line especially now that eth Bitcoin has fallen so just as everyone is getting hyped up for the Bitcoin having and and all the things that come with it what happens if this plays out and instead of getting a left translated Peak like everyone's talking about what happens if we just bleed after it for 6 months and we just see ethusd go back to the lower logarithmic aggression trend line we had a we had a 9month bare Market over here after eth Bitcoin broke down if you ignore the pandemic we had a six-month bare market after eth Bitcoin broke down why can't that happen again Bitcoin when Bitcoin sneezes the rest of the market gets extremely sick take a look at where Bitcoin is this cycle okay as measured Peak to Peak as measured Peak to Peak you can see how far ahead of schedule we are I mean we are so far ahead of schedule right now Bitcoin has never been this heat of going into the having it's always been the last two cycles Bitcoin was 60% below its high when we went into the having if Bitcoin falls back into line with the last couple of Cycles what happens to eth you know I mean you can see that eth Bitcoin is going down right so if Bitcoin USD goes back to where it was previously let's say Bitcoin goes back to where it was just say like I don't know half a year ago but instead of eth Bitcoin being up here it's all the way down here then ethusd gets hit a lot harder right that's the reason why the Bitcoin valuations are important if you take the inverse of one over if you take the inverse of e Bitcoin so you're looking at the Bitcoin eth valuation what do you notice over here one Bitcoin would have gotten you about 11 to 12 eth now it gets you 20 eth I think it's going to go out pretty high here and potentially get you know 32 E when it's all said and done now when you look at eth Bitcoin there's a case to be made that it's either on a logarithmic regression path or it's an oscillator okay so the logarithmic regression path would be viewed like this something like that meaning even if you're a long-term Bull on the eth Bitcoin valuation which I've said many many times like I can understand why you might be I mean these are technically higher lows but even if you are it's still likely is going to go down to the 03 to 04 range before you figure out if the higher lows are important or if the lower Highs are more important because everyone on X whenever I post anything about the eth Bitcoin valuation they will tell me well you're ignoring the higher low I'm not ignoring anything you know I've pointed them out a million times but the reality is that you have higher lows here but eth Bitcoin has also not seen a new high since 2017 that's a long time you know imagine if like Bitcoin hadn't seen a new all-time high since 2017 you know how people give uh the gold bugs a hard time because gold took like 10 years to put on a new all-time high I mean who are you talking to if you're an eth maxi you have no room to stand really here because it's been bleeding against Bitcoin since 2017 yes eusd has gone to new Highs but so what you still you know it still was lower highs against Bitcoin sure as measured from the bottom e outperforms Bitcoin in a QE bull market how many people have said over the last two and a half years that you know just you wait e outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market it outperforms Bitcoin in a QE bull market but in a qt bull market e Bitcoin gets annihilated in fact if you look at quarterly returns for eth Bitcoin the last if you include this quarter which is just started the last six quarters have been red you know that's not the definition of holding up well that's the definition of a slow and painful bleed where retail investors keep capitulating because they they're changing their mind about it and I think that eth Bitcoin has entered into the final capitulation phase so I don't know exactly how long it's going to take to find a bottom I can tell you that the last couple of times it took about two to three months okay so here you can see we broke down in like October it bottomed out about two months later here it broke down in Ju July it bottomed out about 2 months later about 8 weeks in fact so there is a case to be made that it could bottom in June right there's a case to be made that it could um again it's probably going to be dependent on when the FED pivots If the Fed doesn't pivot until later then it could take longer for it to bottom in fact while it did bottom in June it still or sorry over here while it bottomed in August and then basically put in a double bottom in December now a lot of people will say that I've seen on on X when I post about this they'll say oh so you're just telling me in two more months eth is you know they'll say that they'll their interpretation of me saying that eth Bitcoin might find a bottom this summer their interpretation of that is to then immediately assume that that means eth is going to Skyrocket following that the reality is that even after eth Bitcoin bottomed in August of 2019 eth us D even after eth Bitcoin bottomed ethusd still dropped 47% after that and if you ignore the pandemic it dropped about 30% okay that is going to be the next phase of the market cycle which I think is going to be a difficult phase because do you know how over the last two and a half years I've said that that eth Bitcoin will go down no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD the next phase of the cycle as we get into rate cuts is especially when the FED pivots from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing and E Bitcoin finally finds a bottom probably between 03 to 04 the next phase is me saying that eth Bitcoin goes up no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD the reason why that's going to be challenging is because a lot of people are going to assume that if eth Bitcoin is going up they're going to assume that ethusd is going up but in reality that's not what happened last cycle eth Bitcoin started to go up and put in higher lows and I mean this was a higher low here but ethusd was still going down that's why the last year has been frustrating because Bitcoin dominance has gone up and I said many times that e Bitcoin will bleed no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD and it has but ethusd has gone up so people feel like they missed out my only point was if you want crypto bitcoin's better play than eth so yes maybe you feel like you missed out on eth you still just would have been better off with Bitcoin so you didn't really miss out on anything in fact if you were to go look at a DCA strategy if you had bought Bitcoin $100 of it even since the beginning of 2022 through today you're currently up about 125% had you done the same thing for ethereum you're only up 68% right and if you actually take it from say November of 2022 right if we actually take it from the the the capitulation region or whatever you can see that with eth you'd be up about 69% but with Bitcoin you'd be up 120% so this is why I mean I've learned my lesson you know I've tried really hard to sort of preach the the the talk about Bitcoin dominance and all Bitcoin Pairs and and thinking that I could get to through to some people and I think I have reached some people but I can assure you the next cycle this will not be my goal okay it will not be my goal anymore because I've learned the hard way that people do not care about Bitcoin valuations for the most part they mostly focus on USD valuations and they don't see that eth Bitcoin has dropped 40% from the highs all they care about or 45% from the highs all they care about is the fact that it's gone up recently but I think people are about to find out why the Bitcoin valuation matters it's been fun in games up until this point but eth Bitcoin had not broken support it has broken support now the last two times this happened ethusd had a considerable drop and it lasted for at least a few months over here and then the last cycle it lasted for about half a year so please understand that this is not you know do you think I I mean look guys I really enjoyed talking about e Bitcoin back over here when I was bullish on it in 2019 I really enjoyed it and and everyone liked you know everyone liked me and then I became the bad guy in you know in in 2022 when I pointed out the fact that eth Bitcoin was in a distribution phase and it was very hard for me mentally because I had a lot of friends back then in the ethereum community that essentially turned their back on me and and started you know they they were once people that I communicated with in a good way and in a positive way and because I Chang my view they you know essentially completely changed their opinion about me and it's been very hard dealing with that um and and you know even this video over here I talked about the coming collapse you know talking about it coming back down here and and and continuing to to sort of break down um you know looking at at these various Trends and I you know Market the market is a difficult thing you know because if you're bullish on something and I mean this is maybe some advice for for any of you guys that search your own YouTube channel um it's hard because I I I feel like as as and this is maybe just some Reflections but think as a as a influencer for back lack of better word in the crypto space naturally you're going to be if you're making videos about something you're going to be bullish on it more for for a lot of people right if you're going to start a YouTube channel on an asset class it's not like you're going to start it just to say you know say bad things about it right when you start it you're naturally bullish on it right I started mine in mid 2019 I was bullish on eth bitcoin I saw the opportunity there but as an influencer you either stop making videos as the hero or you do it long enough to become the villain and it's not a fun place to be um it's really not and I I'm I'm happy that this process is is likely almost over but I still think it needs at least a couple more months okay June at the earliest is my guess that eth Bitcoin bottoms out June at the earliest about mid June could be when it finally bottoms out which would be interesting because that's when it bottomed out in 2022 in fact so if you look at it from that perspective what if it just bottoms eight weeks after breaking support just like it did here and just like it did here and if it bottoms eight weeks later after breaking support that puts the bottom in mid June basically maybe early June early let me get this exact because I don't I don't want to tell you guys something this wrong um from the low so we broke it last week so eight weeks later would be the week of June 3 right so I mean if it if it happened by the end of the week right it would be you know June 10th right June 9th June 10th so I could see a compelling case for it essentially bottoming out as early as June but it's also going to be dependent on monetary policy right if we get to June and the FED is still not cutting rates and and they're still not going from quantitative easing to quantitative or quantitative tightening to quantitative easing then it might go on longer and you know it's very possible we just go into a recession um but I I do think my base case at this point in time is that eth Bitcoin bottoms this summer ethusd bleeds a little bit longer and then at some point later this year or early next year the FED will will turn the money printer back on and then you will see a bull you know a a bull phase for the E Bitcoin valuation but I don't think we're there yet I don't and you know this is a long process you can't really rush it we can come up you know everyone's had a thousand different narratives for the last two and a half years as to why I was wrong on the eth Bitcoin valuation the deflationary aspect of it the tokenomics right all the merge proof of stake all these things they said I'm not considering the spot ETF right even after the spot ETF for Bitcoin was launched what happened eth Bitcoin got a pretty big pump and do you guys realize how many people dunked on me then where are they now right because it just keeps on bleeding and now I'm seeing the same thing now people are saying well after the having you know e Bitcoin will will show you what's up but I I don't think so I think it's going to keep on bleeding for the next couple of months maybe bottoming out by mid June at the earliest maybe early to mid June um potentially later depending on on what the FED does those are my views it's been hard expressing them for a while but to be completely honest I I don't apologize for them um this is the entire reason I I mean I I just wanted to help right I just wanted to help the Bitcoin dominant stuff I know it's made me a ton of enemies but I I was just trying to help and and now it's you know it's a it's it's broken out right it really has broken out and I think it's about to go to 60% that's where I think it's going 60% so it can't get to 60% easily if eth Bitcoin doesn't drop and I I do think that eth Bitcoin is going to drop to the 03 to 0.04 range and the reason why you should heed this warning if you don't hold ethereum is because the altcoin market gets wrecked even worse okay so if you look at altcoins from last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down the altcoin market got destroyed frankly um you know if you were to look at at total three and I know everyone's just saying this is a is a dip buying opportunity but I'm I'm over here thinking that this is this right this is when you know this was just before the FED pivoted what if this is the same thing and everyone's just buying the dip on alt as they just slowly bleed back down for the next several months so when eth Bitcoin collapsed last cycle all USD valuations fell 72% so I guess it was actually about the same um as as as eth us so about 72% so 72% drop would actually put alt at a new low can that happen maybe I often come back to this idea that everyone you know that no one's going to like but if their Bitcoin valuation can put in new lows right like if A's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if Dot's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if litecoin's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if maddox's Bitcoin valuation can put in a new low if all of these different altcoins can put in new lows on their Bitcoin valuations then they can put new lows on their USD valuations too I didn't want to believe it last cycle I really didn't and and that's what happened they put in new lows a lot of them put in new lows so I think that is is is something that is worthwhile to think about you know and I I know I I know these I I hate putting these videos out frankly because then I'm just inundated with with um you know with with people who who troll me back but I don't want to I don't want to say things that don't believe and I learned the lesson the hard way the last cycle and the reality of the situation right the reality the altcoin Reckoning was was always based on their Bitcoin valuations I said that in basically every altcoin Reckoning video the altcoin Reckoning re refers to the devaluation of alt Bitcoin pairs alt Bitcoin pairs are putting in new lows what does that mean it means the altcoin Reckoning never ended that's what it means that's my interpretation of it so those are my thoughts about ethereum I've tried to you know to be diplomatic about the US Dev evaluation um in terms of hey it's going to go up if Bitcoin goes up but with eth Bitcoin breaking down I I do feel some very strong conviction that it is is time it is time for ethereum to make the Journey Back to the lower regression band admittedly it has taken a lot longer than I thought I'm not going to pretend like I predicted this perfectly because I haven't and I've been wrong about many many things but the last two cycles that e Bitcoin broke down that is when eth went to the lower logarithmic progression trend line and I just I don't think this time is going to be any different if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe crypt.of this either way um but as we you know as we do get further into the cycle um you know I know a lot of you guys are are wanting me to talk a lot more about altcoins especially as they bought them out against Bitcoin but frankly I don't know I mean I I do want to talk about at least the larger you know the the Bitcoin and ethereum I will talk about those but there's so much there's just so much garbage being shilled everywhere right now that that that people are being paid to do it and it's just it's such a you know such such a disheartening thing honestly like I will get people asking me to uh shill a a micro cap you know a meme coin and they'll offer you know money to do so and I will say no and I will ignore them and I I honestly just typically block them because I I don't really want to talk to those people and then a few days later I will see people on on X Shilling that coin and and I know and they pretend like they just think it's a good coin when in reality I know that they're being paid to do it and they're not disclosing it and then their followers are following them and then they're selling those those they they they were given these allocations in these projects and they're selling those coins to their followers as they promote them and those people get all the accolades because that's what people want they want the 100x gems they want to gamble right but that usually doesn't work right get rich quick schemes really don't work and um you really have to be careful and you know the issue that I found is that so many people in crypto they just they they they forget about it right they'll they'll fall for the scams and then and then they'll get mad at those people that Shield them and then six months later they'll forget about it and fall for the same thing over again so I I really do hope that people stop doing it I hope that people stop following the people that do it because it it makes a joke of the entire industry and I I think that if we're ever going to grow as an industry we really have to get past all the meme coin stuff I'm not saying that you can't have some form of of the Mee coin there's always going to be something there but guys I mean there's like thousands of them right now and and that's why you're seeing Bitcoin dominance go up everyone who was bullish on altcoins this year for the most part told me that Bitcoin dominance had topped so yes some of the altcoins went up on their USD valuations but not because the reasons they thought right Bitcoin went up more um and now if Bitcoin does cool off after the having then then they find out why their altcoins went up and it wasn't because there was anything fundamentally great about it it was just because Bitcoin went up and people were chasing the next great thing but just be careful uh be careful with all those accounts that are are shilling that garbage um out there I want to be clear I don't think ethereum Falls in that category I think ethereum is a legitimate project and my views on its Bitcoin valuation are not a reflection on my fundamental views of ethereum they're just a reflection on monetary policy and that's what makes it so difficult is because you know being bearish on eth bitcoin makes a lot of people assume I'm antie when in reality the very first videos on my channel were bullish on the eth Bitcoin valuation so I've learned a lot I mean as you know just as as a person making content in the crypto space um over the last couple years I'm not really sure if I want to go through that process again next cycle but um that's where we stand we'll see if this if it plays out kind of like it did the last couple of Cycles if I'm wrong which there's a chance I've been wrong about plenty of things I do think that if I am wrong about eusd going back down there it must be because we're getting some type of left translated cycle that's not my base case I my base case is not for a translated cycle it's not um I just think that if we do go uh if it doesn't follow this path then I I think it must be because of a left translated cycle any we'll go and wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in

video,2024-04-16 00:00:00,"The video discusses the Ethereum-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio, its historical patterns, and the implications for Ethereum's USD valuation (ETH/USD). The speaker argues that the breakdown of the ETH/BTC ratio is a significant event that has been largely overlooked, and it suggests a potential 60-75% drop in ETH/USD, similar to previous instances when the ratio broke down.The speaker believes that during periods of quantitative tightening, ETH/BTC tends to bleed, and Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is a better investment than Ethereum. The overall sentiment is bearish, with the speaker predicting that Ethereum could potentially reach $2,000 this summer and eventually test the lower logarithmic regression trend line.The speaker provides additional context and insights, noting that the last six quarters have seen red returns for the ETH/BTC ratio, indicating a slow and painful bleed where retail investors keep capitulating. The speaker suggests that the ETH/BTC ratio has entered the final capitulation phase and could potentially bottom out in June, depending on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions.The speaker acknowledges the challenges of expressing bearish views on Ethereum, as it has made them unpopular within the Ethereum community. However, the speaker stands by their analysis, believing that the breakdown of the ETH/BTC ratio is a crucial event that investors should pay attention to, as it could lead to a significant decline in Ethereum's USD valuation, and Bitcoin may be a more favorable investment during periods of monetary policy tightening.The main message and conclusion remains the same: the breakdown of the ETH/BTC ratio is a crucial event that investors should pay attention to, as it could lead to a significant decline in Ethereum's USD valuation, and Bitcoin may be a more favorable investment during periods of monetary policy tightening.",365,"[-0.0040512085, 0.0038890839, 0.009857178, 0.050476074, -0.021499634, -0.016311646, 0.01335907, -0.05795288, 0.014274597, 0.045898438, -0.021865845, 0.004650116,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the having if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom the sale will be ending just after the having so make sure you check it out and lock in the lower rate let's go ahead and jump in the Bitcoin having is probably one of the most significant events in our industry I often find people debating every cycle you know whether the having is priced in or not whether it has an effect on pric or not my view is that you know we've had three having before we had one in 2012 one in 2016 and of course one in 2020 and I I certainly do think that the having does play a role in the cycles of the crypto verse um I also think that monetary policy plays a role but I don't really fall in either Camp completely I don't think that it's only based on supply side stuff and I don't think it is only based on you know monetary policy I think it's a combination of of different things markets are complex um they're they're based on a lot of different things and so because the having is one of the most important events I wanted to do a video where we talk about it and talk about where where I have previously said that theit the price of Bitcoin may be now price predictions are honestly something that I'm not super into um because usually you know usually price predictions don't really turn out that great if if you put in a price prediction and it goes above it then you know the comments aren't so nice and if you put a price prediction and we don't quite get there you know people are also upset but I wanted to to revisit something that I said four years ago and kind of see like where are we with respect to that so four years ago I put out this video Bitcoin Fair valuation at the next tabing in 2024 I put out this video in 2020 in May of 2020 the price of Bitcoin was around $8,000 and what I said back then was that if we follow the fair value logarithmic regression trend line then by the fourth having which is the having that's about to occur the price to bitcoin would be between 40 to $50,000 okay that's what I said back then clearly we are above that price right clearly if we go back and look at the video that I put out a year ago or no this was at the end of 2022 um or mid 2022 just before the the the um the final collapse occurred I also sort of Drew it out going to around a 40 to 50K so with Bitcoin right now at 63k it's ahead right I mean there's no denying it it's ahead of where I said it was going to be back then now of course back then putting out a price prediction four years later um and and hoping that it would be accurate at all was probably something I was fairly naive about uh but here we are 4 years later and the price of Bitcoin is actually above the target range that I put and it's also above this area that I put as well going into the having and so with that in mind I I want to discuss a couple of things that that may come up after the having um that could very well uh take some people by surprise now there's a lot of different thoughts to this current cycle with it being you know so hot at this point in the cycle we've never seen the market put in new highs before the having right this is the first time ever that Bitcoin has put in new highs before the having and so that was you know probably one of the reasons why back then I I didn't think it would be quite so high but we are at new highs before the having and so I just want to talk about what you know what to potentially expect after the happing now there's two different trends of thought here one of which is a left translated Peak okay now to be completely honest I'm not really in the left translated Peak camp but it does have like maybe 40% of my attention and the reason for that is if you were to take the ROI of Bitcoin from Peak to Peak and you take it from the April Peak Peak instead of the November 2021 Peak and you compare it to last cycle it sort of looks like it potentially could form into a peak sooner rather than later in which case you would get a left translated top meaning the the the actual top occurs way before anyone thinks it will historically Bitcoin has topped out in the fourth quarter of the post having year so if you look at Major Peaks that Bitcoin has had in the past if I were to get an arrow here you can see that this top was in Q4 of the post having year this one was in Q4 of the post having year and this one was in Q4 of the posst having Year we're currently in Q2 of the having year so you know that is is still about six quarters away when Bitcoin typically tops but again so far this cycle is anything but typical with Bitcoin putting in new before the having so if it is to translate into a left translated Peak a left translated cycle then it would be more likely that the top would occur in 2024 as opposed to 2025 if we are going to follow that then I have to imagine that we would follow potentially what happened last cycle now it's not really my base cas but again it would be foolish not to at least acknowledge the similarities but on the other hand where I would say 60% of my attention is right now is what if this cycle is just like prior cycles and we are all over here jumping through hoops trying to explain why this time is different when potentially it just Peaks when it normally does and one way that we could go about getting to that point would be that if we had a cool off in the summer okay now there's no guarantee and if we follow this path then you might see the exact opposite of a summer lull but if there is a summer lull then one thing to keep in mind when you look at the last two cycles as measured Peak to Peak you can see that at this point in the cycle Bitcoin was only up or it was it was actually still about 60% down from its all-time high now I want you to think about that for a minute in both prior Cycles at this point as measured Peak to Peak Bitcoin was 60% below the all-time high 60% below it now right now Bitcoin is not 60% below the prior high in fact 60% below the prior High would put Bitcoin all the way down at around $26,000 that's how accelerated we are this cycle look at the last cycle 60% down from that Peak you can see that by May of 2020 that was when the having occurred Bitcoin was down 60% from the high and then if you go back to the cycle before that this the that the having occurred in July if I remember correctly and if you go to July of 2016 you will see that Bitcoin was approximately down 60% from the high this having it's not right it's not 60% down from the high in fact it is at the high it's at the high which has never happened before so this has caused a lot of people to view this cycle as different from the prior ones and I have to tell you they make a fair point they make make a fair point and if you measure it from the April top you can kind of see that Bitcoin is doing just about what it always does at this point in the cycle if you take the April top as the more important top and of course there is evidence to suggest that the April top is the more important top for instance some of that evidence to suggest the April top is the more important top is to look at views to a lot of different cryptocurrency YouTube channels and to note that there were more views in the first half of 2021 than there were in the second half where Bitcoin basically just put in a lower high in terms of social activity but somehow a higher high in terms of price if you look at Bitcoin with respect to its 50e moving average one of the things that it does after every major cycle top is that it goes back down to the 50 we and then gets a bounce a dead cap bounce before ultimately capitulating we saw that happen over here as well go back to the 50 we get a dead bounce and then go all the way down this past cycle we did not see that exactly what happened was we went back to the 50 we and instead of it just being a dead cap bounce to a lower high which is what potentially that would have been we ended up getting a higher high which took a lot of people off guard now I was optimistic of a higher high but honestly I think because of for for wrong reasons you know and sometimes you get things right for the wrongs reasons and and it's important to take that into consideration so we can see that that happened right we can see that we went to the 50 we we got a bounce but that time it actually led to a higher high the even the intermediate bull market in 2019 had us bouncing off the 50 week at some point and so the 50 we today is at around 40K it's at 39.2k 39.3k which is interesting because again that is way below the current prices way below current prices and I have to imagine that if we do not evolve into a left translated top if we do not right so there's two op you know there's two options right we evolve into a left translated top where the peak occurs in 2024 or we evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 if we're going to evolve into a normal cycle where the peak occurs in 2025 you really need to see Bitcoin cool off for a while and again as measured Peak to Peak you can see just how far quote unquote ahead of schedule this cycle is it's actually not that unfamiliar when you think about it the reason it seems like this time is different is because Bitcoin is at new all-time Highs but if you look at the last cycle there was a period where it too was well above its prior cycle but what eventually happened is it bled back down and basically got in line with the prior cycle and then still ended up showing diminishing returns okay and then it actually got ahead of that cycle again this is why a lot of people thought we were going to go to 300 K last cycle but it still was diminishing returns so I want to continue to put forth this idea that if we do not evolve into a left translated Peak sometime around the having and instead the market cools off going into the summer then you might just see something like this where it causes the cycle to just get back in line with prior Cycles now that of course could make a lot of people think that the cycle that the peak is over and and the Bull Run is is is completely done and and maybe they're right right but there is at least some evidence to suggest that that could be what is ultimately in store for us as we get lat into the cycle if you're not familiar with how the last cycle worked and why we what what happened when we bled back down here there's a number of things that really put Bitcoin back into a intermediate bare Market sort of you had a a quantitative tightening bull market and then a bare Market as rate Cuts arrived and then a QE bull market that topped in 2025 now take a a look at Bitcoin this cycle and see how it's doing something very very similar in the sense that it's had this major run during High interest rates you can see it's had this run during High interest rates and in fact if you were to look very closely at when the FED paused here and compare it to this you can see something very similar happened right it it fell just after the FED paused here it fell just after the FED paused and then it went up quite a lot but ultimately what happened is that it it found a local top as just before rate Cuts arrived and then it bled for a while before getting another bull run into the post having year now by the way the having is only four four days away so if we do come up and put in a new local high before the having or maybe around the having that still doesn't necessarily invalidate the idea of the market cooling off sometime after the having if the left translated Peak is not going to occur okay so again there's two thoughts you have a left translated Peak where us Deens just can't help ourselves and everyone just front run runs everything until until the consumer caves or the other idea which would support the idea of this time not being different would just for the cycle to get back in line now if the cycle gets back in line then maybe this view from four years ago of around a you know 40 to 50K Bitcoin by the fourth having isn't that far off I know right now if we were to go back to 40 to 50 okay it would probably feel like the world's falling apart for a lot of people but one thing to consider is that when when e I'm you know I don't know how I made it this far in the video without talking about it one thing to consider last cycle is that the 30% drop Bitcoin had pretty shallow drops during this QT bull market right pretty shallow drops and then eventually it finally got a 30% drop that 30% drop corresponded precisely to the point when eth Bitcoin broke down and eth Bitcoin just broke down below the summer 2022 low so if you were to get a 30% drop sometime after the having that would actually put you kind of right around that range that we said way back over here and in addition to that it would also get you Loosely backed in line with where the prior Cycles were so going into this Bitcoin having is certainly different in the sense that we've never seen a new all-time high before the habing if you were to go look at the risk metric of Bitcoin you will see that the risk on bitcoin has never been this High going into the having in fact the last time we went into the the the 20 when we went into the 2020 having the risk of Bitcoin was at 04 when you look at the 2016 having in July of 2016 the risk on bitcoin was 0.4 today the Bitcoin risk is6 so it's actually quite a bit higher than it was during the last two 3 to4 this time we find ourselves at 639 and only a few weeks ago the risk was in the 7 to8 risk band to give you an idea of what the 04 risk band would look like which is where we were going into the last two that's where the 04 to 0.5 wristband is that's where the price of Bitcoin was at the last two Habs and you can see actually that Bitcoin when those rate Cuts arrived right here had that correction back to the 100 we moving average now what's fascinating about that is that it would correspond to the prior breakout zone so I I I feel like there's two different ways that we can look at the market here here that make the most amount of sense number one is that this is not different from the prior cycles and we're kind of on track with where we should be and that could be viewed by maybe looking at the ROI after the after the low if you look at the ROI after the low and you compare this cycle with two cycles ago this is exactly where we were but you can see that it at this point it did cool off for a while and then did get a drop kind of um you know this was day 520 or so about you know a month and a half from now or so so you can view it like that or you can view it from the peak and still say we're where we should be based on uh based on measuring it from the April top right if you take this out Peak to Peak if you measure it from the April top we're pretty much where we should be but again I can't help but think are we are we are we doing the same thing again where everyone tries to come up with a reason for why this time is different but in reality it's not so my thought process on the matter is this as we go into the Bitcoin having if Bitcoin accelerates into the having and post having and into June right if it is something like that where you know over here in 2019 in fact before rate Cuts arrived it actually did rally in until June last year we had a a local top in April but then we swept the high in June if we get something like that where Bitcoin continues to go up throughout the summer then I would be more in tune with the idea of a left translated top where you get a top in 2024 as opposed to say 2025 however on the other hand if you get a low Top by Bitcoin here as rate Cuts arrive and then instead of you know and that could still include sweeping the prior high right but if you get a look kind of like we did over here with the spot ETF we we put in a new high on the day of the spot ETF for the cycle if on the other hand we see the market cool off into the summer and go to say the 04 to 0.5 wristband or even the 0. 3 to point4 wristband and we get the market more back in line with the prior two cycles then I I think that perhaps the base case should still be that the cycle is playing out just as it always has and you still could get a top in in late 2025 and in fact it was this very intermediate bare Market that kind of scared a lot of people off in fact what happens if something like that happens again where rate Cuts arrive and you go back down scares a lot of people off and then because everyone gets scared off the FED starts printing money again and then you get a QE bow Market I've said this before and I'll say it again there's two types of bull markets in crypto there's quantitative tightening bull markets that occur during periods when the FED is lowering reducing the assets on their balance sheet that's what we got in 2019 and that's what we've got over here and during those periods during those periods eth Bitcoin goes down eth Bitcoin goes down during QT quantitative tightening bull markets how many people for the last couple of years have said that eth outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market that's not true not without any disclaimer because as you can see bitcoin's been going up since late November of 2022 and eth Bitcoin has been going down the entire time so that is why I still think there is some evidence to suggest the cycle may play out like it always does rather than a left translated top I'm not completely unsympathetic to the idea of a left translated Peak there's a lot of really smart people out there that frankly provide a compelling case for it and I could honestly provide a compelling case for it I just showed you guys some of the different charts but if Bitcoin does not run into the highest wristbands the 0. N to one wristband this summer and instead it just cools off like it did back over here after the having it might scare a lot of people off but perhaps it's just doing what it did last cycle and it the only reason that the top the local the midcycle top came later was because rate Cuts came later this cycle than they did last cycle so you have quantitative tightening bull markets where Bitcoin goes up as e Bitcoin bleeds all Bitcoin pairs bleed and then you have QE bull markets that go where Bitcoin goes up as eth Bitcoin goes up so eth outperforms Bitcoin in a QE Market but not a QT Market there's two different different types of bull markets so that is a very important distinction and I think we've only received more and more evidenced over the last year that Bitcoin really is dependent somewhat on monetary policy because last September when eth Bitcoin came back down to to this area right here there were there were a lot of people that thought that it had bottomed because that's when it had bottomed in the last cycle Q3 of the pre having year this development here which is what I said was likely going to happen this development of the the devaluation of eth against Bitcoin shows that the market is very much dependent on monetary policy whether we want to believe it or not so if that is the case right if that continues to be the case then you very well could see a a repeat of what happened over here sort of an intermediate Lull in the market followed by because of rate Cuts right that occur during rate Cuts followed by the last rate cut which leads to a QE bull market where you maybe top out when you normally do in the latter part of the post tapping year so two different theories if you're new here that's what is you know has really been discussed over the last uh year or so is this cycle different is it not I honestly think if you if you have a bias on it you're going to find the evidence that you're looking for um I I think we we'll know soon enough we we'll know soon enough if Bitcoin cools off into the summer which it very well could we we've seen gold breakout just like it did in mid 2019 we've seen eth Bitcoin break down just like it did in mid 20 M mid 2019 all Bitcoin pairs still haven't broken down yet but if it cools off into the summer then it just seems like it's the same thing as last cycle it's just that the the midcycle top was nine months later about about n nine months later if on the other hand after the having Bitcoin just accelerates to the upside once again then I will have to uh I will probably say that there's more Merit to the idea of of a left translated top but that's what I'm looking at right now and so to just revisit my prediction back in 2020 what would be the fair value of Bitcoin at the fourth having of 40 to 50k I find myself today seeing a $64,000 Bitcoin 4 days before the having and I I can't think I can't help but think to myself wow back then when I made that prediction I thought it was a lofty prediction that frankly was maybe not you know not that likely to come true because you know when Bitcoin is at 8K and and it really hadn't done anything for a couple of years I wasn't really that optimistic um of of you know exactly how accurate this prediction would be come to find out I was too conservative potentially right I was too conservative so it just goes to show how difficult these markets are to predict um four years ago price of Bitcoin was at 8K I said fourth having 40 to 50 instead we find ourselves at 64 and what's fascinating to me is that if we were at 40 to 50K I think it would you know a lot of people would think the the world's falling apart when in reality that would have been what the fair value sort of suggested it would be and that chart that chart that you see in that video is just this chart right here um these regression bands here so at the last taing we were at the fair value that's the other thing that why I said 40 to 50K back then because at every prior having Bitcoin was at the fair value so in no the fit to non-bubble data so in November 2012 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to non-bubble data in July of 2016 Bitcoin was at the fair value fit to quote unquote non-bubble data in May of 2020 Bitcoin was at its fair value fit to again quote unquote non bubble data theoretically I should have updated this chart because it does I think need to get updated every cycle I haven't really done it yet if I did update it it would just shift it down very very slightly but right now according to this chart the fair value is around um 52k 52k but if you if you were to refit it based on this data over here it would actually probably put the fair value somewhere between 40 to 50K which is why I said back over here like we'll have to refit it um and and it'll be around 40 to 50K so we're above that level right now if on the other side of the having or something we see that level just know that that is is is what the um you know the regression band would have ultimately suggested for this part of the cycle so those are my thoughts going into the Bitcoin having we will see what happens uh as the having comes around it's only four days away and and we will do an update in maybe a month or so we'll see what happened you know after the having if we just contined to rally on into a left translated top or if it cools off like 2019 and and we just kind of come back down and and cool off until until the last rate cut arrives if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs

upcoming Bitcoin halving event and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency market. The speaker analyzes past Bitcoin halving cycles and presents two possible scenarios for the current cycle: a left-translated peak where the market tops out earlier than expected, or a more typical cycle where the market cools off after the halving and peaks later in the post-halving year. The speaker notes that Bitcoin is currently trading above the fair value range of $40-50k that he had previously predicted for the fourth halving, suggesting the market may be ahead of schedule. However, he acknowledges the difficulty of making accurate long-term price predictions. The video explores various technical indicators and market trends, including Bitcoin's relationship to the 50-week moving average, the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, and the influence of monetary policy on the crypto market. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with the speaker presenting both bullish and bearish scenarios while emphasizing the complexity of the market.In conclusion, the speaker suggests that the market's behavior after the upcoming halving will provide more clarity on whether this cycle is following a left-translated or more typical pattern, and advises viewers to closely monitor the market's developments in the coming months.",248,"[0.023620605, 0.014144897, 0.002040863, -0.064575195, -0.0030231476, 0.008560181, -0.031463623, -0.023727417, -0.0043792725, 0.040374756,

Hi, today we're going to talk about cardano and it's native token Ada if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium add into the cryptoverse tocom let's go and jump in it's been about I think four to five months since I last did a dedicated video on cardano I mostly just speak about Bitcoin or sometimes we'll Branch out to ethereum we'll do stuff on on you know the macroverse we'll do stuff on bitcoin dominance I don't do a ton of videos on individual altcoins and the reason I haven't I will explain later in the video but you should know that while most of the stuff I talk about on this channel most of the charts that I present are on bitcoin for instance this is the end of the cryptoverse website and we've got thousands of different charts but if you click on any individual chart let's say the hotle waves for example the default is for it to show Bitcoin right and you can go look at the long-term holders for Bitcoin however while we have a lot of these charts for Bitcoin and I spend most of my time communicating what Bitcoin is doing you should know that the website has a lot more functionality than that and if you click on assets up here you can find a list of a lot of different crypto cryptocurrencies for a lot of different charts that then you can pull up that chart for that cryptocurrency so in this case you're looking at long-term holder hotle waves for cardano so my goal in this video is to go through a lot of different charts explain what My Views have previously been talk about what I've been right about and what I have been wrong about um try to be as Fair as possible and that's my goal one thing to do by the way on the website if you do have access to it one cool thing you can do that I think many people might not know is that if you go over to the asset filter you can just actually click on you know any number of cryptocurrencies right we have a hundreds of different cryptocurrencies on here but if you want to click on say cardano or whatever you're interested in it will then load the charts that we have for that asset right so then you can see all these charts where you know if you just want to click on any random one let's say days since percentage gain you know how long has it been since Ada went up 100% it'll show you that chart right and then you can just click back and you can go to another chart if you want um but it's a pretty cool feature uh you know we've been trying to build this out as best we can for you know a lot of different cryptocurrencies so in this video I'm going to talk about again where I think you know what I think is the important thing to look at and I want to explain my bias on this so my bias and again it's not anything against Ada my bias since 2022 began has been that altcoins will bleed to bitcoin that has been my view I've said it a thousand times probably more than a thousand times most everyone's going to know that that has been my view right and and a is no exception I I I I do think that it has been following the general path so that is something that has been playing out I wanted to make this video now because Ada Bitcoin is at a pretty crucial level okay and we're going to talk a lot about that it's at a pretty crucial level right now it's approaching 800 sets approaching 800 sets so in general my view is that when we get to a phase of the market cycle where we can identify it as a a region where Bitcoin dominance is going to go up which is what I came to the conclusion of back over here I was very very bullish on bitcoin dominance really starting over here once I came to the conclusion that Bitcoin dominance was going to go from about 40% up to 60% what I have said relentlessly is that alts will bleed back to bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance will go up now so far that has been playing out out collectively there are some altcoins that have been outperforming Bitcoin but what you may notice is that a lot of the larger market cap altcoins have been bleeding and it's not just cardano right it's not just Ada it's a lot of them I mean look at look at ethereum you see how Ada Bitcoin is testing support guess what e Bitcoin is testing support dot Bitcoin is testing support it's kind of already below support right mad Bitcoin already lost support so it's nothing specific about ADA I mean I see a lot of different narratives running around all that sort of stuff and and the narratives can can certainly seem convincing at at certain stages of the cycle but I want to tell you why I don't think any of those narratives matter and I'm going to tell you what I think does matter and it all comes down for me to monetary policy and and the the overall Trends in the dominance of Bitcoin okay so I want you to think back over the last couple of years for Ada all right think about every narrative there has been about the Ada EV valuation against Bitcoin and again I've been bearish on it for a long time but I want you to think about every narrative there has been has anything turned it around not yet we'll see if it can but it hasn't happened yet and I want to show you what happened last cycle that actually turned around right where did at a Bitcoin bottom last cycle well it bottomed at 400 sets before that it was also at around 400 sets actually less than that it was all the way down at 270 SATs so 270 then it went up to to 400 now one of the things that I've received a lot of criticism for over the last couple of years is that a lot of people are are assuming that ADA Bitcoin will hold support on this trend line or at least we assuming that it would hold support it's starting to look like that might not be the case and I've been clear that my base case is that it does go below 800 STS that is my base case um but what actually caused it to bottom that is what we're interested in here right there's a thousand different narratives we can come up with you can talk about the community all you want none of that stuff matters right I me we can talk about community community community but I mean it that stuff is just you know it's it's it just doesn't matter you know it it doesn't and one of the things that I I I think is is very important with alt coins is what causes them to turn around is it the narratives in the media is it you know whatever the most recent YouTuber said including me you know it's not based on any of that stuff what if it's simply based on whether we're in a period of quantitative tightening or quantitative easing now unfortunately we only have one data point to go off of so I'm not asking you to take this to the bank at least as far as crypto is concerned but if you look up thousands of here thousands of years of monetary policy history you will in fact see that during higher interest rate environments higher risk assets bleed to lower risk assets and why is that it's because we can be more confident that something like Bitcoin Will Survive over a longer period of time than we can any altcoin right I mean I think that's I think most people would agree with that if you go back to 2013 you know Bitcoin was number one if you look at 2011 you know I mean every year Bitcoin has been number one ethereum has been number two right I mean for the last several years going back to like you know the last cycle back in like 2017 when it overtook others to to take that spot but it's been pretty clear that Bitcoin kind of stays around altcoins come and go now some altcoins go put in new highs in future cycles and some of them don't one thing about cardano last cycle that made me interested in it in 2019 was that it I I thought it had bottomed out against Bitcoin right and that was why I was interested in it back then was because I thought it had bottomed out against Bitcoin in a Bitcoin USD downtrend and so that made me interested in it and then it was one of the few altcoins from the prior cycle that was able to take out its high there have been a lot of altcoins that didn't take out their highs or the ones that did only went marginally above them so it's important to recognize that a lot of altcoins can become relics in future Cycles so if you are going to get on on board with one you really hope it's not going to be a relic right and that's why I say never marry an altcoin because you're going to take half in the divorce don't marry an altcoin that's my non-financial advice so what caused adaa to bottom against Bitcoin what caused it my thinking is a shift in monetary policy if you look at the assets of the Federal Reserve you will in fact see that it was when the FED shifted from quantitative tightening where they were reducing the size of their balance sheet to quantitative easing that is precisely where Ada a Bitcoin found the bottom you can see it pretty clearly it had nothing to do with all the narratives that people are arguing about on X or on YouTube nothing to do with any of that stuff it was just hey Ada to bitcoin goes down during QT and adaa Bitcoin goes up during QE and once again we find ourselves in a situation where we are in QT and guess what eight of bitcoin's going down and there were a lot of people last summer you know back over here in in in 2023 that were very adamant that ADA to bitcoin was going to be up only from that point because the summer of 2020 or the summer of 2019 is when adaa Bitcoin bottomed last cycle therefore once you got to the having year right the general speculation was that it would only go up it only go back up and why is that why is that speculation so convincing for a lot of people it's because they say that altcoins outperform Bitcoin in a bull run that's the prevailing narrative right that altcoins outperform Bitcoin in a bull run I've been fairly clear that that is not universally true under all market conditions it's not how many times have you heard people say well eth Bitcoin is holding up pretty well compared to last cycle or eth will outperform Bitcoin in the bull market just you wait right but guess guess what despite all of it it's still down against Bitcoin 44% that's not holding up well that's people saying it's holding up well as it just keeps on bleeding right so when did eth Bitcoin bottom last cycle was it the prevailing narrative was it what someone said on on Twitter or what someone said on YouTube or did it bottom when the FED shifted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing if you think that I am cherry-picking cardono and ethereum to support this narrative which is a fair accusation so let me explain myself if you were to look at all Bitcoin pairs this is total 3 minus usct divided by Bitcoin you will find that the collective altcoin Market also bottomed when we shifted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing we only took out that low a couple of you know a couple of times later just on major parabolic rallies by Bitcoin but you can clearly see that ADA fell in the same basket as the General altcoin market it bottomed when we went from when the FED went from reducing their balance sheet to increasing it and it wasn't and it never had to be any more complicated than that and so I've spent a lot of time trying to convince people of this with ethereum with really not a lot of luck and I've I've tried the same thing with a lot of altcoins and I again very mixed amount of luck and the reason has has been and and continues to be that they they say that well it'll it'll outform Bitcoin in a bull market but there's two types of bull markets is I I think what a lot of people are missing there are QE markets and there are qtb markets in a q QT bull market if you look at Ada Bitcoin in a qt bull market for Bitcoin USD let me pull up Bitcoin USD on this chart and we we will try to make it so it's a little bit easier to read here so let me switch this to a log scale so you can see that in a this is 2019 over here right when when Bitcoin was going up over here during QT Ada Bitcoin went down when Bitcoin was going up over here during QE right during QE Ada to bitcoin was going up here Bitcoin USD found this low in November it's been going up Ada of Bitcoin has not been going up like it did over here in 2020 and 2021 right it's been going down since then the reason is because we're still in QT we have not yet gone back to QE so again like it it's this it's making a lot of people really frustrated I mean a lot of people are at each other's throats my only hope back in early 2022 my my goal was to try to prevent people from experiencing this pain that they're experiencing now with these altcoins that just keep seeming like they're bleeding gets Bitcoin and they just won't stop and Bitcoin goes up and the altcoin doesn't go up as much and then Bitcoin corrects and then the altcoin corrects more right I experienced that last cycle and my goal was to try to help people avoid that and instead I think what happens I just pissed a lot of people off right but that was my experience so where is adaa Bitcoin today right where is it today well it's at about 800 31 set so you know all of my views over the last 2 and a half years at this point in time for adaa Bitcoin I would argue have been correct that's not necessarily true though for Ada USD and I will talk about that in a little bit adaab Bitcoin as of right this minute is basically about as low as it's been with exception of this Wick over here it's about as low as it's been for this entire you know this entire mve down right the point of all of that was to say look guys I know you like cardano I know you like Ada but during QT you're probably going to be better off with Bitcoin it's nothing personal against cardano there nothing personal it's just this is the reality of the situation and this was the reality of the situation in 2019 that I refused to accept I didn't I don't want to accept it right and so what I did was I you know I I bought Ada throughout this entire phase and at one point at you know eventually the FED pivoted ate a Bitcoin bottomed and I was just like well hell I could have just stuck with Bitcoin during that entire time taken on a lot less risk and gotten a lot more reward because after all this time a to bitcoin dropped 95% even during a Bitcoin bull market now we didn't put in new Highs but we still had a Bitcoin bull market so how is this time different well look this trend line here that I know a lot of a lot of my biggest critics have been sort of focused on it looks like it's breaking right I have been fairly clear that I think that it will break right what would cause Ada Bitcoin to bottom out here right I'm having a you know I'm trying to have like a discussion in my mind of like what would actually cause it the bottom out here the only thing that I could think of would be that if something catastrophic happens and the FED pivots a lot sooner than anyone's expecting one other thing we we we talked about how Ada Bitcoin bottomed you know when basically when the the the fed pivoted from QT to QE right so let me let me overlay this on the chart so we can see that it also though bottomed after the FED cut rates as well so if you were to Overlay us interest rates onto this chart you can pretty clearly see that adaa Bitcoin did not bottom until after the FED cut rates now this cycle the FED has not yet cut rates and they also have not shifted from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing so my Buy is still that ADA a Bitcoin will bleed with that said that doesn't mean that it goes down in a straight line although for the last couple of months it really has done that so I making this video right now knowing that there is a possibility that it could bounce off of the range low if it does I just think it will be a temporary bounce kind of like maybe this one over here right you can see that it came back down it got a little bit of a bounce and then ultimately bled much slower with that said I'm still not even convinced we're going to get that bounce considering that we've already you know we already spent a lot of time trying to hold right here at 1100 SATs and we're unable to do so which was basically the same area that it tried to hold over here so this is the issue for Ada Bitcoin this is the issue for Ada what happens if it goes below this level right what happens if it goes below this level well we can look at case studies and I I mean I can walk you through what has historically happened on various alt Bitcoin pairs or various alt USD pairs once their Bitcoin valuations break below key support levels but and maybe I should do that but this is the level to watch 800 sets all right my bias is to think that it will go below 800 sets that's my bias I've been pretty clear about that for the last two years it's been a long journey here we've come down to it a couple of times we've bounced off of it a couple of times we're now down here a third time that is my bias is that we will break below it however I could understand why someone might be more optimistic they might say well what if what if this is like this down here you know what if you know in terms of where we are in this cycle you know this is the having year and this in the having year over here you can see that ADA Bitcoin was putting in supports that It ultimately built off of so I'm not blind to that I mean I can see that that occurred however this also bottomed out after the FED cut rates and once loer monetary policy arrived which still has not yet happened so that's why I'm not yet convinced of that and one great example that many examples you can look at is there's so many other altcoins that are already breaking support so why should a to be any different right madic Bitcoin has broken support pretty clearly right it broke support and you know it broke support the week of March 11th and it's and ever since it broke I mean look how long it took to break support a weekly close below the range low it finally got that Weekly close below the range low the week of March 11th and ever since then it just keeps on going down this is I I remember this pattern this was exactly what Ada Bitcoin did over here after it broke this range low look what adaa Bitcoin did right it finally got a weekly close below it and then it just went down for like two months straight and then it finally bottomed out and then it slowly trended back up so you can see that this is already happening with some alts they're breaking support now madic Bitcoin broke support the week of March 11th what has madic USD done since the week of March 11th because everyone the Bitcoin valuation is what is the only thing that matters but for some reason you guys care more about the USD valuation but ever since March 11th madic USD has gone down right so when alts breaks support against Bitcoin then they usually start to bleed on their USD pairs so that's why this 800 sat level is a very important level for cardano if it  holds then perhaps it doesn't have to meet the Fate that I've outlined of just sort of bleeding back down to the range lows however my bias will be and it will continue to be and it has been for the last two years that as long as the FED has not pivoted I think the bias remains down for all Bitcoin pairs collectively although we can always identify a few that are going against that Trend that is my view right so even if there is a bounce right even if AA does bounce against Bitcoin here and let's say goes back all the way up to 11 or 12200 sets I'm sure I would get a lot of snarky comments right but my view would not change like I would still think it's still going to inevitably roll over over and break now what would change my mind well if at a Bitcoin let's say we're some time off in the future 6 months from now or something if it's still holding above 800 SATs and you know and and we're we're away from QT and we're back in QE then I will think that you know I I might change my mind right but that hasn't happened yet right so how can I how can I be compelled to change my mind nothing I have said about a to Bitcoin has been wrong I mean it again it's just been bleeding for a long time now one thing that I was looking at with you know sort of a to bitcoin is as I've said before altcoins are oscillators at best right it's a tail OFA time so if it's an oscillator at best then you have somewhat of a well- defined range here okay and so if it is an oscillator which again is an if it's already down 87% right it's already down 87% if it were to go to the bottom of this range that's another 50% drop by Ada of Bitcoin okay that might sound like a lot but you know over here it dropped 95% um even if it did drop from there down to here that would still be diminishing losses if it were to bottom out at 400 SATs the reason why I was never convinced and I'm still not I I don't think that this trend line will hold and it still looks like it's it's looks like it's breaking it now but again horizontal support lines are more important than diagonals so I don't think that you should put a lot of faith in this diagonal trend line I never have I'm just saying other people that view these videos have sort of said well why does he draw draw the trend line and then say it's not going to hold the reason I said that was because if you look at a to e it it didn't hold the trend line right I mean you could draw similar trend lines for a to eth right and you know bounced off of it but eventually it fell below it and a while back I did a video on cardono where I talked about um if I can find this uh parallel Channel where we talked about ADA eth and basically said that let me switch this to it's already on AOG scale hold on um but basically what I said was that you know a lot of these a lot of these alt coins they they essentially are are oscillators right at best right and I don't know I don't know exactly how to you know you could connect the dots like this and kind if you just ignore this Wick then you can connect the dots like this and say you know you have this low this low this low and then you have this High you have a high here you have a high here but it's still a fairly convincing down downtrend channel right don't get mad at me right take it out with the data I don't control what's happening I'm just telling you this is what's happening back over here in the summer of 2023 I have a video on cardano and I said in that video that I thought the most likely outcome in the short term was for it to go back up here on its ether pair to tag this trend line before rate Cuts arrive why did I say that back then because if you look at interest rates you can see that well that's exactly what it did last cycle was it went back up to sort of the mid part of this trend line tagged it before rate Cuts arrived but it fell off before those rate Cuts arrived right same thing is happening here right it tagged this trend line sort of the mid part of the channel rate Cuts haven't arrived yet Right In fact when it tagged the trend line or sorry when it tagged that that trend line it was about halfway through the PS this trend line was tagged basically back in December so perhaps that indicates we are getting close to rate Cuts in the next few months now I know what you're thinking you're like well Ben you're wrong because the Market's saying rate Cuts aren't coming till September and the market could be right or like they have been for a long time the market could be wrong where they're constantly pricing in stuff based on the most recent data but they're ignoring ing the things that matter more right I mean inflation yes it was a hot print but that can change right easily in a couple of months and and and rate Cuts could get priced back in I have said many many times that the pricing out of rate Cuts will cause them to be priced back in earlier this year the market was expecting six rate Cuts now they're only expecting two this year so how can we put that much faith in what the market thinks if they've gone from six cuts to two cuts in four months in three and a half months you can't put a lot of weight into this stuff because that from six cuts to two cuts but here's the issue as rate Cuts get priced out it causes companies to throw in the towel because they're like they're they're trying to survive until rate Cuts arrive until looser monetary policy arrives hopefully that increases Demand right we're trying to survive as they keep getting pushed further and further out more and more companies give up you don't believe me you know you can see it pretty clearly right if you go look at at at us um if we just go look at at at bankruptcies in the United States right if you go look at bankruptcies it's still relatively low right I'm not trying to raise the alarm but it's trending up it's trending up pretty clearly the green line is uh this is interest rates and the white line is um bankruptcies this is three months but this these are are bankrupt ancies and it's there's a lag on it right I mean it only shows it through October it only shows it through Q4 of last year but we should get a new data point soon um but bankruptcies are going up right and you can see that interest rates go up bankruptcies go up so the same thing applies over to crypto as looser monetary policy gets pushed further and further out higher risk assets bleed to lower risk assets and that's why bleeds to bitcoin that's why eth bleeds to bitcoin that's why pocot bleeds to bitcoin that's why madic bleeds to bitcoin right link bleeds to bitcoin Litecoin bleeds to bitcoin right it's nothing personal it's just this is what happens during titer monetary policy and you can accept it or you can pretend like it doesn't happen you can of course cherry pick altcoin new altcoins that are smaller market caps and say you're wrong I'm wrong whatever but this is the general Trend and you don't have to look any further than all Bitcoin Pairs and my concern is that the pricing out of these rate Cuts we're now from six rate cuts to two what if that's what it's t what it takes to finally make all Bitcoin pairs breakdown what's fascinating is that last cycle once the range low was set on Alt coins against their Bitcoin pairs it took 41 weeks for them to break down from this low here we're currently at 41 weeks now I don't know if they're going to break down this week or not I think there could be a case to be made for next week during the having as well but you can see that in a lot of ways this time is not different it's taking about the same amount of time as it took last cycle it's just that we reached this point here about three4 later than last cycle and so we still inevitably at some point have to face the rate cut part of the cycle and the rate cut part of the cycle generally comes right after the breakdown and by generally I mean based on the one data point that we have after the breakdown of all Bitcoin pairs if I'm wrong look to this chart to prove it look to see if Ada if all Bitcoin pairs can hold above 04 or in Ada's case if it can hold above 800 sets I don't think it will but if I'm wrong this is where I would be wrong at it would be at this level it would be at 800 sets because if it goes below 800 madx shows you what happens when it breaks support it's not pretty it just starts to bleed so if I'm wrong about adaa Bitcoin from this point I would say I've been right about it for the last two years but sometimes I I ride the trend a bit too long if I'm wrong about it this is where I would be wrong about it because if it goes below here I think it's going to 400 stats that's my that's my view and it's been my view for forever so this is where it needs to hold if I I I'm going to be at all compelled to change my view I think it's going to break prove me wrong and and and we'll see but that is my view and I I'll keep a close eye on it um you know I don't know if it's going to get a little bounce like this or not but it is getting dangerously close and the reason why this is an issue is because the having is next week and if Bitcoin rallies into the having if Bitcoin rallies into the having just like it rallied into the spot ETF and Ada Bitcoin is already on a very precarious level if it can't keep up during that rally then adaa Bitcoin could be broken off support and then when Bitcoin stalls out sometime later after the having you can see here after the ETF it it sted out and went down that's when you could see adaa Bitcoin it's already lost support during a Bitcoin rally and then when Bitcoin gets a correction it no longer has that support level to hold on to and then you you end up getting something like what's happening with with madic Bitcoin and it's not just madic right I mean it's you know you can look at a Bitcoin I mean it just keeps on breaking support after support Litecoin Bitcoin I mean that bleeding against Bitcoin is what Litecoin does best you know so it's a very it's very precarious situation one of the one of the ways I think that might be helpful about to understand Satoshi valuations because I think a lot of people really struggle with thinking about things like it's kind of abstract like oh 800 SATs 400 SATs 1600 SATs like what does that even mean really for a lot of people a lot of people don't really know it's not like tangible to them right but there's a way that I think you can make it more tangible and that's to take the inverse so you go up here and you take 1 / a to bitcoin okay now when you do this you can pretty clearly see a nice compelling Trend and that is look at this or a a way that's not so abstract right now one Bitcoin will get you 120,000 Ada in August 2021 one Bitcoin got you 16,000 Ada in early 2022 I was very clear that altcoins were too risky and they were going to bleed a Bitcoin until dominance hit 60% right that was back when Ada Bitcoin was at or sorry the inverse one Bitcoin would fetch you about 35,000 Ada right so I didn't pivot on it at the actual at that level it was more so q1 2022 where I finally was like all right all Bitcoin pairs are going to bleed the back then one Bitcoin would get you about 38,000 Ada today it gets you 120,000 Ada look at this trend here this is what I this is the Trap that I fell for last cycle do you see this we came up to this level and got rejected by it came all the way back down here we didn't even make it down there yet um in this cycle we you can see it wasn't even as big of a drop here and then after dropping right after dropping we then came up and then broke through it so we we essentially went from one Bitcoin getting you 11,000 Ada here if we get a um a price label to giving you 11,000 Ada there to giving you 250,000 Ada up there here it gave you 16,000 Ada right now it's at 120 you know about 120,000 or so okay so if I'm wrong about ADA a Bitcoin it has to be at this point in my view otherwise if it breaks Above This this it's just going to go to the Range High right I mean there's just not I I just don't think there would be a lot of standing in its way just like over here there wasn't a lot standing in its way once it broke through and it's been you know it's been at this level for a while and and that's my concern is that it's going to break through and come up to this level right so that's I think something that is is worthwhile to consider now what where I have I not been as correct about cardono because that that's something that I I think it's easy for a lot of people to sort of highlight what they've been right about and sort of brush under the rug things they've been wrong about because it's not cool to sort of highlight that you want to be known for only making correct calls and and for having a crystal ball but you know I have news I don't have a crystal ball and I get a lot of things wrong and the only thing you know with 80usd is that back over here in 2023 I did think it was going to go lower than than where it went 23 23 cents I'm not going to try to hide and pretend like I didn't think that I did my understanding was you know thinking that Bitcoin would get a larger a larger correction at the time and I was wrong but I think that the thing to consider here is that ADA USD went up but not because of anything great going on in the altcoin market it just went up because Bitcoin went up because while Ada USD did technically go up a a Bitcoin got a little bit of a bump right but then it's just right back down right it's just right back down and 80usd is probably the most puzzling thing for cardono you know I I I feel very convinced about where its Bitcoin valuation is going I feel very convinced about where it's like eth valuation is going like and and let me I don't think I actually expressed that so let me express it really quick for for the eth valuation my general thought is that you know it probably does something like this where it it you know comes back down and then maybe over here gets a move back up it's kind of my view on a to eth something like that probably so I feel very you know strong about a to bitcoin um or this is inverse of a to bitcoin feel very strong about a to bitcoin a to eth a to USD is is a bit more puzzling because it it it's going to depend on bitcoin right I mean it's it's just going to come down to that and if Bitcoin goes up it can lift Ada with it right just like it did here right I mean just like it did here bit Bitcoin went up and it took a with it so if Bitcoin goes up I mean it can take cardono with it if Bitcoin goes down it's going to take cardano in that direction so Ada USD comes down to what Bitcoin USD does my argument is that ADA to bitcoin and AD to eth doesn't come down to that and and that's why the bit understanding Bitcoin dominance has been so useful because for the last two years if you agreed with me that dominance was going to go up then there really wasn't a compelling case to be super heavy into Ada and I mean you can say whatever you want to but the reality of ADA Bitcoin is you know it's now down 86% 87% from the highs right and even from when I was very vocal about it in in 2022 early 2022 right it's still down like 68% um since that time um so yeah sorry I heard a noise um maybe it's the uh car people but um so that that is at least something that I've spent a lot of time like sort of thinking about um trying to wrap my head around like what is AD USD going to do it's really hard to know it's going to be based on what Bitcoin does and my thought on bitcoin is take a look at this you know we saw Bitcoin USD rally into the spot ETF remember and actually about one week before the spot ETF Bitcoin USD swept the high we're almost at a week before the having if Bitcoin look at this diagonal that that Bitcoin USD was sort of holding it's kind of doing the same thing here right holding a diagonal as it goes into a major event this was the spot ETF so if Bitcoin gets this move into the having and let's say after that it gets a pullback to sort of sweep that low let's say I again I don't know I don't know what it's going to do I've absolutely no idea I'm just saying like you know if it does do something like this um whether this holds or not in my opinion is going to be dependent on if all Bitcoin pairs have collectively broken down so if all Bitcoin pairs have broken down below 04 then I think there's a decent chance Bitcoin could get a larger correction if you look at 2019 during quantitative tightening and high rates the larger correction occurred you know all these Corrections that it previously had were only like 10 15% drops it finally had a larger drop but when that larger drop occurred it didn't occur until after all Bitcoin pairs broke down the week of June 24th that's what marked the local top for Bitcoin was the week of June 24th so if the same thing happens I think you have to keep an eye on all Bitcoin pairs look at look at it like this if you look at Bitcoin USD overlaid onto this chart you will see right here when all Bitcoin pairs broke down that's where Bitcoin USG found a local top so they haven't broken down yet and we still have the having coming up but if they do break down into the having you have to wonder will that Mark a at least a local top if you think about it Bitcoin had a local top in um in April of last year before it had about a you know a two-month drop or so look at this the week of April 10th local top for a while look at 2021 the week of April 12th right so you have the week of April 12th the week of April 10th guess what 2013 the week of or sorry that's 2011 here's 2013 the week of April 8th April is an important time for Bitcoin right and so a lot of times you do see pullbacks into May um just like we had here just like we had here and just like we had over here so if Bitcoin rallies into the having and it breaks Ada Bitcoin off support off of 800 stats and if at that point Bitcoin USD rolls over into May and gets a correction and Ada Bitcoin is already below support then it could do something like what madic Bitcoin is doing where it breaks support and then after it breaks support then the USD valuation starts to bleed back down that is something that I you know I spent a lot of time looking at are the are the Bitcoin valuations if on the other hand Bitcoin does not get a correction after the having and keeps going up then ad USD could go up with it right my only point is that in either case if you think if you agree with my view right there's if Ada Bitcoin goes down no matter what then I've been under the under the opinion that just be Bitcoin heavy until looser monetary policy arrives and then you know sometime after that not immediately because even when it when it arrives it's probably arriving for the wrong reason but that's been my view right exposure to crypto I think especially with a larger market cap alts you're better off with Bitcoin because it it just it's outperforming Bitcoin dominance is going up and yes yes I was wrong about ausd right here I hold my hand up high right I was wrong about it but I will say I think the you know the reason it's gone up up and again this is me rationalizing right is because Bitcoin went up it's not because of any any other reason and so you know if Bitcoin keeps going up it can take Ada with it but you still would have just been better off with Bitcoin as Ada Bitcoin bleeds what you look for for this trend to change is looser monetary policy to arrive so until looser monetary policy arrives why would I change my bias so that's my view if you look at ad USD without any of the monetary policy stuff or the um the Bitcoin valuation stuff I can certainly see how you would come to a completely different conclusion and I don't think it's fair to completely discount that view if you look at this at the Cycles here you can see that ADA USD had this bare Market it then went up back down and then back up came down and then if you ignore the pandemic right it just came came up here and then fell back into the bull market support band before slowly grinding higher and then going up a lot right so look at it like this this is down down right up down up up down up back down to the range low back down to the range low ignore the ignore the pandemic right just pretend like it didn't happen you go up and then you go back to the bullmark export band right you go up and then you go back to the bullmark sport band right which kind of already did we bounced off of it and now we're back to it right so if you were only looking at this I completely get that view right and that's why I've said I'm more puzzled by Ada USD than Ada Bitcoin or Ada eth my view is that if 0usd goes up it's only because bitcoin's going up a lot more right if Bitcoin goes to 80k it can take the altcoin market with it but it's still probably going to outperform the altcoin market so you could get a situation where Ada a Bitcoin breaks down but Ada USD is is is not breaking down in the same way my base case is that ADA Bitcoin breaks down and that ADA USD sort of sees a a a a pullback you know a substantial pullback but this is also a potential outcome and the reason why I have to highlight that is I was wrong about 8usd here right here so I could be wrong you know maybe I'm maybe my view is not is is is not worthwhile to consider right here honestly on ad USD I think I have a better grip on its Bitcoin valuation and it's eth valuation and the reason is because I think that no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD a to bitcoin goes down until looser monetary policy arrives no matter the direction of eth USD I think a to eth goes down until loose monetary policy arrives but ad USD does depend on the direction of Bitcoin USD whereas I don't think Ada Bitcoin does so Ada USD is is much more difficult to forecast in my opinion than Ada a Bitcoin if adaa Bitcoin breaks support then I do think ad USD will drop just like madic Bitcoin broke support madic USD is dropping just like last cycle we saw altcoins break support against Bitcoin and then alt USD Val valuations dropped for a while this trend here will be dependent on does it hold at this bull market support band like it did in 2020 does it hold there or does it not you know and I don't know you could argue that this phase right here is like that phase or you could argue that this phase here is like this phase in fact it looks more like that phase if you were to take a bar pattern right if you uh just line this up here right if you look at that and you put it right here like this to me still looks looks more like this than it does this little one over here and what's interesting is if you overlay us interest rates onto this chart you will see that this pattern here emerged right before rate Cuts arrived what if this pattern here is emerging right before rate Cuts arrive and so as all Bitcoin pairs break down and all USD evaluations roll over that represents the consumer finally becoming weak and then the FED Cuts rates and then they shift from QT to QE all Bitcoin pairs bottom just at the last minute where I finally convince everyone the Bitcoin dominance is going to go up but by the by the time the last person believes in the Bitcoin dominance rally that's when the dominance rally is over I don't think the dominance rally is over yet if you look at Bitcoin dominance it's been slowly building up to the range highs there's been a lot of people that have have completely ignored dominance for years right they cherry-pick micro cap alts to say why dominance doesn't matter they say well eth is holding up well against Bitcoin down 40% is not holding up well you know if you look at at at quarterly returns for you know for asset pairs like eth Bitcoin this is now the six quarter in a row where it's potentially red now we still have a long time to go in this quarter so we don't know but let's take a look at the same thing for Ada Bitcoin look at adaa Bitcoin look at this 2022 adaa Bitcoin was entirely red 2023 it was read three or four quarters and so far this year it's only red there's been one quarter and look at this even the Q4 2021 was read right so you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 out of the last well I guess I mean if you if you just take it from here right so this is 4 8 10 11 if you include this one so out of the last if this is also assuming this current quarter stays red out of the last 11 quarters Ada Bitcoin has been green one quarter right one quarter out of the last 11 by the time I convince the last person the downtrend could be over you know we're probably not that far away because I think that rate cuts and shifts in monetary policy are going to occur this year this is what I was trying to help people avoid but as I said earlier I I think instead of helping people avoid it I hope some people did I think I just made a lot of enemies so next cycle I can practically guarantee you that I'm not going to be going on this you know mission to convince everyone of these altcoins bleeding against Bitcoin during QT because it doesn't get you anywhere right it just makes people M mad at you and if and if the asset goes up on its USD pair they never forgive you even if even if it's bleeding on his Bitcoin pair because people only care about for whatever reason they only care about USD valuations if you look at a to USD you go to assets here and you look at at at just cardano doesn't look as bad right I mean there's still a lot of but there's also some green right you know there was a 62% move in 2023 right there early 2023 and in Q4 133% move q1 9% Q2 negative 9% so like it doesn't look as bad on its USD valuation but let's suppose you carried out a a um a DCA strategy where ever since the beginning of 2022 to the current day you bought $100 worth of bitcoin and you bought it weekly on Monday you would have put in $11,900 your current portfolio valuation would be worth 30.5k let's say you did the same thing for Ada so you'd be up 156% had you done DCA strategy for Bitcoin really since the bare Market began in early 2022 if you did the same thing for Ada you'd only be up 46% so anyone who followed a DCA strategy for Ada can still feel good at the current time on its USD valuation because it's still up 46% and you can be mad at me for being like well you said it was going to go down but the the reality is that you still would have been better off with Bitcoin by a lot and you would have taken on less risk and you would have had more reward this won't go on you know forever there will be a time where adaa Bitcoin gets a more sustained bounce I just don't think it occurs until looser monetary policy arrives that's my view I'm not going to apologize for it I'm going to stick through it this cycle but next cycle I'm done with it I'm not I'm not I'm it's not my mission anymore after this um but that's something to consider now if we go back over here to the asset filter for cardano we can look at a few things we talk about Bitcoin dominance a lot look at Ada dominance where is it right now it's at 7 n5% adaa dominance this past cycle on The Daily actually went higher than it was last cycle that's not something you see a lot of altcoins do it does happen sometimes it's not something you see frequently where did it bottom last cycle it bottomed at a dominance of between 0.5 to 6 it's currently at you know just around 08 so I'm arguing that you know maybe it needs to come down here to 0.5 to 6 if you look at the risk on cardano where is the risk right now 0 463 that's the current risk on Ada 0463 again if you bought here you're doing quite well right now still would have been better off with Bitcoin at some point that changes in terms of a short-term move but when it changes that Trend likely only lasts a year if you look at Ada a Bitcoin what do you notice yes it was slowly trending up over here but the big move it doesn't even last a year right I mean it just lasts a few months right these moves last a few months and then everyone spends years dreaming about them again right they only last a few months so the reality with altcoins is that they bleed against Bitcoin for most of the cycle they get a rapid move up at some point and then everyone spends the next three half years wishing for it again they wish for alt season and while they keep wishing for alt season Bitcoin dominance goes up so no just something something to think about going back to some of the charts let's see what the long-term holders are doing for ad so I mean it looks like it went down a little bit it's not as I mean you know Bitcoin long-term hold I mean it's gone down from 55% down to 48% so if you were to look at at short-term holder hotle waves you can see there's been a little bit of an uptick recently as the price of ADA went up if we were to look at I don't know what do you guys want to look at as if you can respond right now um here's the mvrv zcore for Ada still pretty low look at it for for Bitcoin it's been doing a lot better the issue is you can see last cycle going into rate Cuts Bitcoin also saw the nbrb score go around these levels um and you can see that in 2019 Ada didn't go nearly as high as Bitcoin did on its nbz score in that 2019 move compared to like what it eventually did later once QB returned once Lo monetary policy arrived um not really sure what else there is to talk about with it I mean you guys generally Know My Views at this point here's a draw down from the all-time high on its USD valuation here it is on its Bitcoin valuation right we spent a long time down here right you can even see at one point there was a little divot back up and then it came back down kind of like this right a little divot back up and then it just came back down let's take a look at the days since percentage decline how long has it been since Ada had a 30% drop it's been about 215 days the record is about 253 days or so maybe a little bit more 257 days is the record we're currently at 215 days right so again I mean like it's due at some point for a correction um maybe sometime after the having for Bitcoin there are some other charts that you can look at that are a little bit more optimistic I think some of them are like Roi after the low could be one well I don't know I mean if you look at this one compared to last cycle you know I mean we could just be in a phase where we just sort of slowly bleed a little bit and get one more pop up maybe on a Bitcoin rally and then it and then it just Fades you look at it on Roi after cycle Peak out to the next Peak look at this look how look how close this looks the funny thing is if it were to go down to the last cycle where the last cycle was it would actually put it at the range lows right at the range you know at its prior range lows if it were to just simply go back down to where it was last cycle at this time and you can see that it was after the Peak at this time where it did slowly roll over for a few weeks right so you could get a scenario where it just simply drops back down and still doing what it did last cycle um I don't know if that always I mean does let's see does every cycle here's Litecoin I mean so you can see not every cycle always stays above the prior cycle right so here is you know this is cycle the Blue Line cycle one and then the orange line is cycle two you can see that it did come down and and tag the prior cycle sum then if you compare two to three you can see that three has below to right so that's why you know you can't look at at at this and then you know unilaterally declare that it can't go back down to where the prior cycle was you can see with other coins that it does sometimes happen and I imagine xrp is another example right yeah where it sometimes happens um the first cycle you know compared so the first cycle was the Blue Line the second cycle was this orange line so secondy cycle was worse in fact and then second cycle to third cycle you can say that this cycle for XR P has been a little bit better um than the last cycle as measured from Peak to Peak so I mean I guess I guess my general view on cardano is that I I assume that ADA to bitcoin will bleed I assume that ADA to eth will bleed until loose monetary policy arrives Ada USD I think it's just going to be dependent on what Bitcoin USD does and because I don't know what Bitcoin USD is going to do um because I can't predict you know what these short-term moves are going to do I would still argue that Bitcoin Dominus is going to go up you're better off with Bitcoin then a lot of these altcoins and then after L Luci monetary policy arrives I will I will change my view I don't apologize for it it has not been wrong to be bearish on adaa bitcoin for the last two and a half years there's narratives there's stories about what's causing it to go down all sorts of stories and then you can simply go look at monetary policy and see what actually caused it a turnaround last cycle was going from QT to QE QT no QE yet so I'm not going to change my view prove me wrong by holding 800 SATs as support if it goes below 800 SATs I think 400 SATs is next support where does 400 SATs put it well it depends on what the price of of of Bitcoin is you know here's this wolf frame Alpha so at at at 830 SATs at a 70 what is what is bitcoin right now bitcoin's basically at 71k right so at 71k that puts Ada at you know 59 cents right which is exactly where it is you can see Ada USD is at R around 59 cents at 75,000 Bitcoin 830 sets puts Ada USD at 62 cents right so you can see that if Ada Bitcoin holds support Bitcoin USD could go up and Ada USD could go up with it even though Ada Bitcoin hasn't gone up but what happens if Ada a Bitcoin break support and goes to say 600 STS right let's say it goes to 600 STS and bitcoin's at 75k then you have an ADA that's at 45 cents what happens if Bitcoin gets a large correction back down to 40K and adaa Bitcoin is at 600 CS right then it's back to 24 cents which is back down to the range lows right so you can kind of see I mean 0usd is going to be completely dependent on on bitcoin completely dependent on bitcoin I think Ada Bitcoin and Ada eth are not dependent on bitcoin USD which finalizes the discussion for today for me with Carano and what I've said is that Bitcoin gives you exposure to the upside during quantitative tightening and high rates while also minimizing your downside risk you can get out of me for being bearish on Ada of Bitcoin for the last two and a half years or you can accept the fact that 10 out of last 10 of the last 11 quarters have been R for Ada a Bitcoin and by the time the last person is convinced will probably be right around the time that rate Cuts arrive and that's probably when the market Trend shifts and we go back the other way and I just want people to understand my views why I think that what I've been right about what I've been wrong about not try to hide behind it I'm trying to learn as I go 8usd if you want to be optimistic on it see if it can hold the bullmark sport band that is currently at 56 to 58 cents right so as long as it's holding that you're still there's still a hope right but look if it breaks below like there and gets a weekly close well below it and then just sort of keeps dropping then the trend could last for several more months if you give something like this where it holds as support then maybe there's more upside right it really depends on on what happens here um at this bullmark sport B so keep an eye on the bullmark sport B for Ada USD the 20 week SM the 21 EMA for Ada Bitcoin just keep an eye on on 800 STS below 800 I think it's going to 400 if you want to prove me wrong have it hold 800 thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up

native token ADA, with the presenter expressing a bearish bias on altcoins in general compared to Bitcoin. The presenter argues that ADA's price against Bitcoin (ADA/BTC) is likely to continue declining as long as the Federal Reserve maintains its quantitative tightening (QT) policy, drawing parallels to the previous cycle where ADA/BTC bottomed when the Fed shifted to quantitative easing (QE).The presenter believes that ADA/BTC is approaching a crucial support level around 800 sats and is likely to break below it, potentially leading to further losses. The overall sentiment is bearish, with the presenter advising viewers to be better off holding Bitcoin during QT periods rather than altcoins. The main message is that altcoin performance is heavily influenced by the Fed's monetary policy, and the presenter's conclusion is that ADA is likely to bleed against Bitcoin as long as the current QT environment persists.The presenter further elaborates on the concept of Satoshi valuations, explaining that tracking the inverse of the ADA/BTC ratio (1/ADA/BTC) can provide a more tangible understanding of the altcoin's performance. The presenter highlights the historical trend of this metric, showing how it has fluctuated over time, with one Bitcoin fetching significantly more ADA during periods of bullish sentiment compared to bearish cycles.The presenter acknowledges that they have been wrong about their bearish outlook on ADA/USD in the past, acknowledging that the altcoin's USD valuation has been more puzzling and dependent on Bitcoin's price movements. However, the presenter maintains their conviction that ADA/BTC and ADA/ETH are likely to continue declining until the Fed shifts to a more accommodative monetary policy.The presenter also discusses the potential impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, suggesting that if Bitcoin rallies into the halving but ADA/BTC has already broken below support, it could lead to a more severe decline for the altcoin when Bitcoin eventually corrects. The presenter emphasizes the importance of monitoring the performance of all major altcoin/BTC pairs as a potential indicator of a local top in Bitcoin's price.The additional context provided further reinforces the presenter's bearish outlook on ADA/BTC and ADA/ETH, highlighting the historical precedent of altcoins underperforming during periods of quantitative tightening. The presenter also provides specific price levels to watch, such as the 800 sats support for ADA/BTC and the 56-58 cents support for ADA/USD, emphasizing the importance of these levels in determining the future direction of the altcoin. Overall, the refined summary offers a more comprehensive understanding of the presenter's technical analysis and market outlook for Cardano.",543,"[0.020828247, -0.016082764, 0.014533997,

Hi, today we're going to talk about ethereum dubious speculation if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom throughout this video we're going to talk a lot about various ways that you can look at at the price of ethereum we're really going to focus on ethusd but also eth Bitcoin as I do think it is very relevant to Value assets on their Bitcoin pairs because it helps inform you if they're doing well against a lower risk asset or not okay and if you have if you're new to this channel I've have been of the opinion for about two years now that the eth Bitcoin valuation is in a bare market and again I I I think it's one of those things where it certainly wasn't popular during the merge um but it has fallen a lot ever since and so what I would like to do is is spend some time talking about that talking about what it would take to actually turn the eth Bitcoin train around while I know a lot of people watching this video may assume that I am a Bitcoin Maxi that's not true okay and and you'll find out that it's not true uh here in a few months if we go back to to loer monetary policy but for me what I have said for years now is that a a Bitcoin heavy portfolio over an altcoin heavy portfolio is likely going to do very well now out of the top 20 altcoins Bitcoin has done better than most of them there are some smaller market cap coins that have been created recently that have done better and I'm not trying to to talk about that I I I'm not dismissing that I'm just when I talk about dominance Trends and I talk about the crypto I'm really only talking about the top coins I don't have an opinion on you know whatever the 9,000th altcoin is okay I I I just don't so what I really want to focus on is the patterns that we have previously observed to sort of check in to see if those patterns are continuing what it would take for that pattern to continue what would it take for eth Bitcoin to turn around and so on and so forth okay now first we must understand that my understanding of the cryptoverse is very dependent on monetary policy and it's very dependent on bitcoin valuations if you do not care about Bitcoin valuations then you will not care to hear what I have to say because that is what I I I sort of value my portfolio on if you only care about the USD evaluation it's completely different but when I when I when I buy something I want to I want to be very confident that if it's a riskier asset that it has a good chance to outperform a lower risk asset because if it does not what justification then do I have for holding it now you're probably familiar with all of the narratives by eth that have you know that have been circulating on eth since the merge deflationary aspects tokenomics all that stuff you know the the supply is being burned and that's why it was given as a reason for why the eth Bitcoin valuation would do quite well but narratives are one thing what actually happens is another and despite all the narratives eth Bitcoin is down about 41% since the merch that is a fact right it's a fact now ethusd is up a lot more than I thought it would be at this point again that's also a fact right and I'm not going to skirt around the facts it is up more than I thought it would be but eth Bitcoin has followed the general track that I thought it would follow and I want to talk about you know some of the things like how it's similar to last cycle how it's different than last cycle um and just try to really really take inventory of that one of the things that I think has has been helpful for me for ethereum is just sort of a recognition that it bleeds back to bitcoin while we go into Tighter and Tighter monetary policy it bottoms out theoretically when QT is over and then it starts it starts an uptrend when when QE returns and so that is what I experienced last cycle and My Hope was to help people maximize their risk adjusted returns focus on bitcoin during the QT phase of the cycle and then maybe pivot some of that over to riskier assets once QE returns so at this point eth Bitcoin is now down five quarters in a row okay five quarters in a row now I've been dealing with sort of a lot of people saying what if you're wrong about eth Bitcoin and again it's sort of like you know at what point how many quarters have to go by you know how many quarters have to go by but what I would say is there is a decent chance that eth Bitcoin bottoms out within a few months okay and I want to explain why I want to explain why first of all it's already been five quarters right I mean it's not like it hasn't been in a bare Market it's been in a bare market for over a year now so that is something right it it's something to say like at some point it it it could theoretically turn around the problem is that you you know you do run the risk of trying to catch a falling knife my opinion is that eth Bitcoin will break support I want to be clear I do think it will break support I could be wrong I'm I'm you know I'm happy to go ahead and state that I I could be wrong about that I do think it will break support one of the things about you know sort of this cycle compared to last cycle is if you look at last cycle the low the first low that was set kind of like this low that was set in December of 2017 so it was actually set at the at the the peak for Bitcoin this low was set about three qus later it kind of goes with this this sort of this this Narrative of a lot of things happening 34s after where they previously occurred okay what you'll notice though is when it came back down to sort of hit this trend line it occurred at the end of the bare Market at the end of the bare Market here when it came down came back down to tag the trend line it occurred in January of 2024 so Bitcoin USD is at a different spot than where it was last cycle but it is still eth Bitcoin is still bouncing off of this support level in the same way now what caused eth Bitcoin to finally break support last cycle and botom out what was it it was rate cuts it happened around rate Cuts now guys there's all sorts of of of narratives going around right now about and and and I I feel very conflicted about it because and I'm just being honest right on one hand you have all the Bitcoin Maxis saying that you know that that proof of stake will fail and hey they could be right I I don't think they are but they could be right um you have you have them saying that you know it's destined to to fail or you know it's destined to just go down forever and that you know this whole transition has been a a failure because of the of the Bitcoin valuation and so they point to lower valuations and I agree with them that lower valuations are likely coming for eth Bitcoin and I I I've been very clear that I think it's going to go to 03 to 04 that is my view I think that it bottoms out between 003 to 04 that is where I think eth Bitcoin is going to go but where I would disagree with you know people that are are are just sort full on full on Maxis is that it it can Bounce from there and get a durable bounce now it doesn't have to necessarily lead to new to new cycle highs for E Bitcoin I don't know if it's going to take out this high or not but I would say that regardless of of what happens a year and a half from now let's say Q4 2025 whatever happens I do think that the sort of the true value proposition of ethereum against you know has not really been fully tested yet because it's just a it's this is an artifact of monetary policy right and and ethereum just being fundamentally higher risk than Bitcoin that's all it is it's all it is and so while there's a lot of narratives circul circulating right now about you know eth Bitcoin and and you know a lot of people just keep calling the bottom like they have been for the last two years and then other people say it's going to zero I I've been very bearish on it for a long time you guys know that but I will say this I will say this and I I've learned this myself on a couple of occasions okay if and when it breaks support if and when right I'm assuming that it will but I could be wrong so let's suppose that I'm right for a minute I know it might be hard to believe but let's suppose that I'm right and it breaks support what I would say is you have two months maybe three to find the low two to three months that is my guess because that's how long it took over here and that's how long it took right here about two to three months to find the low once it broke support so I don't know when it's going to break support I have suggested that it could be it could happen in April right it could certainly it could happen happen in March I mean we're you know there's only a few days left in March it's possible um but in order to durably break support you need a weekly close below the range low at 049 and you'd like to see another weekly candle open and close below that level as well so I don't really think you can have confirmation of it occurring until April anyways so I would say that it's possible that it breaks down in April which coincidentally is when the Bitcoin having it and I know there's the whole spot ETF narrative for ethereum but that's still not out until May and and the having comes first so we'll see if eth Bitcoin can break down here but I want to be very clear now if it breaks down if it breaks down I think it would bottom about two to three months later two to three months so if it breaks down in April then potentially it Bottoms in June or July if it breaks down in May then it might bottom in July or August right and so on and so forth right if it if it breaks down in June then it could be August or September right it really just sort of runs a two to three month period after it after it breaks and so I do think it's going to happen I I I really do think it's going to break down and what you'll see very clearly is that when it broke down last cycle right when it broke down last cycle you will see that but it actually bottomed when we went from QT to QE that is precisely where eth Bitcoin bottomed okay right there QT to Q eth Bitcoin bottomed about two months after it broke down the FED has already started to talk about potentially slowing this they didn't say stop but they said slowing but once you get into the discuss once you get into the discussions of slowing it it leads to the progression of stopping it at some point right and the labor market is starting to show some weakness right we're at a 3.9% unemployment rate and so there is a decent chance especially as we get closer to elections that they're going to want to stop the pace of of QT and and and maybe level it out maybe go back to QE we will see but I think this is what's coming for ethereum on its Bitcoin pair so look a lot of people have fought this trend the entire way you know and I don't know what to say I mean I I've made a lot of videos on it every time I make a video you know sometime later it bounces and then it it sort of drags a lot of people back in you know they they say all sorts of things about me and then a few months later you kind of like you look back and you're like oh it was it was it was just another lower high you know so it's a it's a trap that a lot of people have fallen into but I do think I really do think think it it's about to to break down here within the next month or two so one of the patterns we looked at in this video over here we did a video on a theum about a month ago when it was at 2800 and we looked at this ascending this ascending wedge okay and we circled it right here now I wanted and we talked about how it was following this ascending wedge where it came back down to where it met right but first it had an explosive move to the upside right um now let's check in with that and see where we are okay so first of all I want you to look closely at what happened over here with ethusd do you see this ascending wedge and do you see how ethusd came back through that wedge in August in in in August why is that important well if you overlay eth Bitcoin onto this chart you will find that it bottomed in September right it it bottomed right after it fell back through the wedge and again we know that it topped eusd topped one month before rate Cuts so we're potentially getting rate Cuts in June it could be may but the market the market is certainly not expecting that right now those probabilities could change for May depending on where the labor market comes in next week um but if you know whether you get a a rate cut in June or May who really cares the general Trend here to me looks very familiar it I mean it looks incredibly familiar in fact so look at this move that ethusd had it broke out of the wedge it broke out of the wedge and then it it had a pullback and then it had another large move up and then it came collapsing back down through the wedge you see that and that collapse occurred as rate Cuts arrived we know that right it occurred as rate Cuts arrived the the market came came back down to earth as those rate Cuts came in eusd fell back through the wedge now look at ethusd over here it it's the same thing basically if you can connect these dots right here we sort of had a a little bit and we even tested right there we had a little bit of a fake out right there um but you can kind of see something very very similar let me draw this as accurately as I can um and connecting the dots all the way up you can see a very similar wedge but it's much bigger than the last one right clearly it it's a lot it it's a lot bigger but also what is bigger is the rate hiking cycle right I mean this is the artifact of a less impressive rate hiking cycle this is the artifact of this rate hiking cycle so it's kind of all the same to some degree right I mean to a large degree it it is very much the same and what you'll see is that it It ultimately topped out before rate Cuts arrived and then it fell back through the wedge as those rate Cuts arrived so this wedge comes to a sort of a point here in you know June or July right it depends on really how you draw it but around June or July which is relevant considering that this one fell through it when rate Cuts arrived and the First Rate cut is being projected to potentially be June and look at that that is potentially right where it's going to fall through the wedge June or July you see that that doesn't mean it can't go up in the short term right I'm not trying to say that we do have the having next month um you know Bitcoin still needs to break eth down on its Bitcoin pair remember what marked the top for ethereum last cycle during the the tail end of the of the rate hiking cycle in pause was the breakdown of e Bitcoin and that hasn't happened yet right so if you go look at at well let's just go look at eth Bitcoin over here this right here that's what ultimately marks the top for ethusd if we overlay ethusd onto this chart you see right here that's where eth Bitcoin broke down and that's where ethusd topped ethusd tops when eth Bitcoin breaks down okay so what if we're looking at the same thing right ethusd tops somewhere over here when eth Bitcoin breaks down a weekly close below 0.49 right a weekly close below 049 it still hasn't happened yet but we are getting really really close and in fact it you know you might be tempted to look at this move here and say you know did we just get this sort of this penultimate move followed by the final move potentially in April again I don't know I I think there's evidence to support both views there's evidence to say that Bitcoin could rally into April because it still hasn't broken a Bitcoin pairs off support if you were to look at a Bitcoin pairs we know that last cycle they broke down 41 weeks after they set the range low now look closely at this 41 weeks after all Bitcoin pairs set this low here was precisely June 24th when Bitcoin to and now look at all Bitcoin pairs over here 41 weeks after this range low was set would put you the week of a of mid April right I don't know exactly let me let me get this an exact um sort of match here just so I make sure I'm telling you guys 41 weeks so 41 weeks the week of April 8th you give or take a week or so right but I mean again that's right before the having right it's right before the having which is why I'm suggesting that what if the same thing is playing out once again where eth is being sort of it's being lifted up on its USD pair not because of anything fundamental that it's doing differently or better than Bitcoin at this stage because of tighter monetary policy but it's just going up because bitcoin's going up it is not going up on its own in my opinion if it were you would not have five quarters in a row where it's red if you're an eth maxi and you have hated this View for the last five quarters I'm sorry to say you were you would have been better off holding Bitcoin I mean that might be a tough pill to swallow but it's the it's the it's the fact right I mean you would have been better off with Bitcoin over the last five quarters and I I made so many videos about this back when eth Bitcoin was you know going into the merge I said this is a secondary distribution phase you know just like Bitcoin USD had a secondary distribution phase in 2021 you know it seems like everything's being pushed back about 9 10 months and so in the same way that e Bitcoin broke down over here in June 2019 you go fast forward three quarters later and then you add a cycle to it you basically get April of 2024 for it to potentially break down and then if it does break down I'm suggesting that it could bottom out in June or July and if it does bottom out in June or July on its Bitcoin pair and it follows what it did last cycle then that means it falls through the wedge in June or July which is exactly what happened over here right it fell through the wedge in July and August and E Bitcoin bottomed in September so what happens is maybe this time it falls the wedge in May or June and then eth Bitcoin Bottoms in July or or August right or you know something like you kind of understand like the uh the sort of the path though I think that this is playing out again is my guess on a much larger scale but again the rate hiking cycle was on a much larger scale if you struggle with this idea because eth USG has gone up so much that it couldn't possibly go back down I would sort of retort and say well you know if it is strong on its own accord why does it keep bleeding to bitcoin so the issue here for ethereum and I've said this many many times is that at some point in the future Bitcoin is going to roll over and and start putting in lower highs okay I don't know exactly when that's going to be I've suggested that that Bitcoin could find a local top sometime in the first half of this year I think it's April was a good candidate we saw we saw last year April Bitcoin found a local top it swept the high in June uh 2021 it found a local top in April swept the high in November 2013 it found a local high in April swept you know went well above the highs in Q4 so I do think April is is sort of a relevant time period to sort of consider here and so if Bitcoin does find a local top in April going into the having and if it breaks eth off of its Bitcoin support level to during that process and then Bitcoin rolls over exactly how it did in 2019 when rate Cuts arrived the problem for ethereum at that point and why I think it could break through that wedge again to the downside is because it no longer has anywhere to hide on its Bitcoin pair throughout this entire process we've seen all sorts of of sort of predictions of why eth Bitcoin is quote unquote holding up well you know again no you know dropping 40% against something that's less risky is not holding up well and maybe what it's going to take to sort of do away with that sort of that view is for it to finally break down to 03 to 04 if it goes to 035 I don't know how anyone's going to say it's holding up well at that point because if it goes to 03 to 04 let's say it goes to um well no take it from the actual high right if I mean right now from the actual high it's down 42 and a half% if it were to go down to 0035 that's a 60% % drop that seems okay I mean like so what you know it seems possible that that could happen and it doesn't necessarily have any long-term implications for ethereum it's just that's what it does during a rate hiking cycle and late business cycle environment is that it it drops against less risk lower risk assets like Bitcoin it drops and so what I I I wonder is are you going to have a scenario where it breaks down and then people finally give up on it the the people that I've been arguing with for the last two years they finally give up on it because it's finally breaking this support and when they see 0.03 or 04 they're going to freak out because they haven't seen that I mean a lot of people join crypto over here they never saw eth Bitcoin down over here right they never saw that there is a different sort of breed of crypto investors interested in crypto over here than the people who joined over here okay so if it comes back down here then the question ultimately becomes will those people capitulate and if they do it could be very quickly and it could take only a couple of months from the breakdown Point here e Bitcoin fell about 50% from the breakdown Point here it fell about 40% from the breakdown Point here maybe it falls 30% right if it does that puts it at 035 right I've said between 03 to 04 forever it's been a long road it's been a long road down but it is it is it seems like it's playing out so well that's up for debate I mean I think it it it certainly seems like the eth Bitcoin aspect of it is playing out eusd has been more resilient than I thought it was going to be and I fully admit that I take ownership for it I'm not trying to skirt around that you know last video when eth was at like 2800 I talked about you know it seemed like it was following this pattern and if it follows it you could see it sort of push a lot higher up into the high 3000s maybe even go to 4K um and here we are and the reality though is that if Bitcoin does push up in April again then it could take eth higher again right I don't know again I think there's compelling views both ways if you think about you know why I think Bitcoin could rally into the having is because it rallied into the spot ETF right so that's another reason why it could rally into the having it also hasn't broken alts off their support levels yet and we know that last cycle Bitcoin rallied until all Bitcoin pairs broke down and it rallied until eth Bitcoin broke down well Bitcoin topped on a Bitcoin Bitcoin us e Bitcoin broke down and a Bitcoin USD lower high but that sort of the evidence to suggest that Bitcoin could could go higher into the having is that Bitcoin pairs has still not broken down and eth Bitcoin has still not broken down the Counterpoint though is we know that when we went into the merge ethusd actually topped out about one month before the merge right if you look at at the merge here it topped out in August and then it was a lower high in in September during the merge so I I don't want to completely dismiss the idea of a lower high by Bitcoin USD um but if it if it does put in a higher high I want you to take a look at at one really interesting pattern here if it's it does put in a higher high let's suppose that you know we just had and it's really hard to say right I mean there's there's certainly different two different ways that you could look at this you know you see this move from the wedge here it came up pull back and then blow off top into the you know a month before the First Rate cut same kind of thing right I just don't know if we should look at it like this like one two three where it already had that pullback and the blowoff top has already occurred right or if you look at it like you know this this entire move is just one move and then this is the pullback and then you get one more push into the High I mean in fact if you take a price percent here from that low to the actual top it was another 58% rally the funny thing is from that low 58% up is is actually right at the prior all-time high isn't that a coincidence right it would be right at the prior all-time high for ethereum you know also what's interesting is if that were to occur and if Bitcoin did rally into you know sort of the um into the uh the the having um we are only about 20% away from Total market cap getting back to its previous high but the main difference between total market cap getting to its high here in November of 2021 and where it is right now the main difference is that Bitcoin takes up much more market share now than it ever did back then right so or during that rally right I mean look at this look at where Bitcoin dominance was it was at 43% now Bitcoin dominance is at 53% so it's 10% higher but total market cap is the same that's the same thing that happened over here in the 2019 rally right I mean total market cap I mean it didn't put in a new high but the the qualitative View it is the same right not quantitative but the qualitative pattern is the same where total market cap went up a lot and the main thing that changed was that Bitcoin dominance you know the last time it had been at that level it was at coincidentally about 42 43% and then by the time Bitcoin USD topped out it was at around 60% right there so I can't help but think that ethusd will follow what it did last cycle I don't know if it's going to go higher or not I don't know if it's going to go up to the prior high or not I would say this if ethusd goes to the prior high it's only because Bitcoin is at like 80k or something it's not I don't see eth going to the prior high and Bitcoin staying at 70k that that's sort of the reality and so if you believe that right if you think that that view is correct that eth Bitcoin is in the process of breaking down and that eth USD is following that same pattern from last cycle then I keep going back to this idea well like why not just hold Bitcoin over ethereum until a a few months after e Bitcoin breaks down to me that has seemed like the obvious solution for the last two years a lot of people have fought it and I've I've you know I've sort of learned that no matter how many lower highs get put in um people are going to believe whatever they want to believe but that's a long a long way down by eth Bitcoin and I'm suggesting that while it is 45% down I think it's possible it could go a little bit further down now just because eth Bitcoin bottoms doesn't mean ethusd initially you know finds a low right then either I mean it could certainly go into um a bit of a downtrend if the market does cool off into the summer but I I did just want to highlight this pattern we we we we showed this pattern back over here we've seen I mean this was back when eth was at 2800 we've seen it since 2800 we saw it rally all the way up to to to 4,000 um I don't know if if the top is in for it already or if it gets one last push but that's where I am on it I I think either this is the top or you get one more Push by it um and then and then you see it and but because I think eth Bitcoin is is really close to breaking down then I would think that whenever that happens eth USD drops the last two times that eth Bitcoin broke down ethusd dropped right I mean the last couple of times and so I I don't think this time will be different I think it will be more or less the same where whenever whenever I don't know when but whenever eth Bitcoin breaks support eusd gets a large correction I mean you can see it pretty clearly in both of these prior prior Cycles right I mean right here once e Bitcoin broke down ethereum dropped from like you know I mean from the from these highs it it had gone all the way up to $516 and then it dropped about to $7 about 50% drop and then over here when it broke down it dropped from 30 a little over $300 with a wick up to 360 all the way back down to around $100 was like a 75% drop um over here was about a 50% drop I think think um so I think that that could still play out I really do and I I I think that you know at this point you either buy it or you don't um you know you either either think it's right or not and I I think you could forgive people for having some skepticism considering how how much better a theum has done on its USD pair than I thought it was going to do but my view on eth bitcoin has been has been correct and I I think that what has thrown me for a loop is the is sort of this reality that this rate hiking cycle was a lot more impressive than the one we saw last cycle which is interesting because I kind of thought it was going to be I me I said higher for longer I was always in that camp um but I mean it it certainly seems like it it could be playing out in a very very similar fashion just on a much grander scale right so what I would look for is does do we does ethusd fall back through this wedge as the summer arrives just like it did over here that's what I would look at a lot of people you know I I can't tell you how many people keep asking me to make like an accumulation phase of a lifetime video on a the guys I'm not going to promise anything like that I will just say this you know if you were and you valued the you know if you valued assets on their Bitcoin pairs at what point at what point in the last you know in the last two years has eth Bitcoin been at a point where today you can say oh yeah that was a good idea to you know to to YOLO in at that point there hasn't been a time I mean eth Bitcoin right now is sitting at 0507 there in fact if you look at weekly closes there's only been one week where it had a close I believe lower than where it is now since this whole thing began so in my mind you know for those that want that video the accumulation phase of Al right if ID made that video back over here or here what justification would I tell you guys you know oh god you bought ethereum oh don't worry it's down 50% against the lower risk asset like Bitcoin but just believe me no you know for everyone that says eth outperforms Bitcoin in a bull run you're only right if you're assuming a QE Bull Run if you're assuming a QT Bull Run that's not true eth Bitcoin bled during the last Bitcoin QT bull run during this bull run over here by Bitcoin USD in 2019 eth Bitcoin went down while Bitcoin USD went up same thing here Bitcoin USD up eat Bitcoin down so you can't say it's going to outperform bitcoin at a bull run yeah maybe after rate Cuts arrived and maybe after we see all the damage the FED has done and then QE returns then yeah like I would agree with you it probably would outperform Bitcoin at that point but only because it's been bleeding for it for the last five quarters in a row so my guess dubious speculation of course but my guess is that there is a chance that e Bitcoin Bottoms in Q2 it might take until a little a little longer it might takeing Co until Q3 I I I don't want to completely dismiss that idea what I would say is after it breaks down assuming that it does I would say give it a few months and then I think from that point especially if you start to see those higher lows being set and and and rate Cuts have arrived and even better if QE returns then I think that would be the low for eth Bitcoin and I think it's going to be between .3 to 04 okay so that's my view on it um and you know I it's become some somewhat of a meme at this point and I I kind of get it like I'm not like I don't I'm not trying to dispute it honestly um but I I did want to you know sort of address what I what I've previously spoken about and that is um the the logarithmic regression band for ethereum so let me just go ahead and pull it back up um if I can find it so here it is um and the general idea right after after eth Bitcoin broke down last cycle right here that is where ethusd topped right eth USD topped right there when eth Bitcoin broke down and then ethusd went to the bottom of the regression ban so whenever ethusd tops out whether it already has or not or it gets one more push into the Bitcoin having I don't know again my view on it is that the only way eth goes up to the prior high is if Bitcoin is much higher right I mean if bitcoin's at 80k then eth can go higher but if Bitcoin only tops out at like 75k or 73k if the top is already in then I you know that's it right I don't think eth is going to go higher on its own so at some point whenever this whenever ethereum sort of assuming that it does right whenever it it fades back down I do think there's a decent chance it's going to go back down to the regression band now the regression band is much higher than it was back over here so back over here in 2022 it was at 400 and then here it was at um it was at 500 so it obviously is a lot higher today than it was back then um but assuming Bitcoin cools off into the summer and assuming that eth Bitcoin has broken down then why would we assume that that's that this can't happen right why would we assume that it can't happen and if you think about you know Bitcoin USD and you look at at say like the the risk metric for Bitcoin USD again you know we've been in the we've hit the 7 to point8 wristband for a while here and a lot of times within about three to four months or so after that you find yourself back at the. 3 to point4 wristband um again that doesn't mean Bitcoin can't go higher first sometimes it goes into higher wristbands as well as you can see but if that is the case right if Bitcoin does get a pullback into the summer after after rate Cuts sort of roll in then what are the chances that ethusd also gets a pullback probably pretty high and if eth Bitcoin has broken down already then unfortunately for eth there's nowhere to hide and that's when I think it could theoretically break through this wedge um and and then come back down to the to the lower logarithmic aggression ban I know I'm pretty stubborn on this um and I I think it you know you can probably forgive people that have have had an a you know have sort of mocked this view that it it will eventually do that after e Bitcoin breaks down um and I I could be wrong I I I get again I get things wrong all the time I'm just doing the best I can um I I in future Cycles I'm probably not going to be as opinionated because even you know even when even when I get things right like you know like the eth Bitcoin valuation dropping 40% the problem is that nobody cares because ethusd is up you know and and if on the if on the chance that I'm right and ethusd does fall back through this wedge and come and and go to the lower regression band I don't even know that it would have been worth it waiting you know a year and a half for it to occur right so I don't think next cycle I I will be as opinionated about this stuff I think I'll just kind of take a backseat and and um you know let the Deens Deens so to speak but um I I think one thing I've learned is that like you know it's not always about you know I mean sometimes it's more important to trying to think the way to phrase it being right is not everything right and I I certainly don't even get everything right but even being right about certain things doesn't necessarily mean everything right being right about e Bitcoin dropping 40% doesn't even necessarily matter right and and if I'm right and it goes to .3 to 04 I don't know like who cares you know I mean it doesn't mean that like anyone who who just DC it back over here is necessarily hurting I still think they would have been better off just buying Bitcoin instead of buying ethereum right but I mean I don't think they're going to shed a tear because eth is only a you know a lower multiple than Bitcoin I mean they still made money on it right so sort of a lesson learned by me you know like I mean being right first of all being right is is something that only occurs you a certain portion of the time uh when you're wrong people definitely don't let you forget it but even when you're right it still doesn't necessarily mean everything is the point right I can understand why if you are an eth maxi you know why just dcing it and and sort of tuning out the Bitcoin valuation is is a better strategy for you than waiting for some type of future collapse that may or may not even happen that's what I want to say right so again I don't think that being right is everything um and that's kind of something I've learned a lot and that's coming from someone who again you know I have a track record of being right about certain things being wrong about other things things I've learned that you know when you're wrong they never let you forget it and even when you're right it still doesn't always matter okay so just take that for what it's worth especially if you're a person who wants to go on YouTube and make your own content try not to focus on on that as much um if you can and and um focus on on other things I think that's what I'll I'll try to do differently next cycle um is is that but again we'll see I me we'll see if it if this plays out the same way where it it sort of falls back through here on on Ray cuts and if it does then if it comes back down here and the eth Bitcoin valuation you know is at 0.3 to 04 then I think you start to make the case that it it could have bottomed out and it could start trending higher if you look actually at at eth Bitcoin you see this logarithmic aggression trend line for ethusd you see how it kind of like just returns to it every so often we haven't hit it yet but I would say one interesting thing about it is that eth Bitcoin is arguably following a a very similar Trend right I don't I haven't like fitted or anything um but you can imagine what it would look like right um and if I were just to find the sort of the r or the curve function again this is not this is not perfect right but you kind you can kind of see the same pattern right that you saw for ethusd you can see the same pattern for eth Bitcoin so I think the the issue is that whether you know whether you think that this is going to break to new highs eventually or or come back down to 02 I would argue that wherever it goes it first goes to 03 to 04 and then from there we figure out if it's either going to go up or down my guess is after it goes to 03 to 04 and Spend a While there it'll have enough fuel to then go back up for a while um but that is my current View and I I I think you can kind of see how in the same way that ethusd could fall back in to these levels I think that eth Bitcoin could fall back in to the logarithmic aggression trend line but it's taking a very long period of time arguably because this cycle has been just shifted out in terms of everything happening about three quarters later if you think about like when Bitcoin USD topped in 2019 it was the summer of 2019 if we do get a local top in April that's about three quarters later all Bitcoin pairs broke down over here in June 2019 again April will be about 3/4s later the merge happened about 3/4s after Bitcoin USD topped um just seems like a lot of things have been shifted by about N9 or 10 months and so what happens if if eth Bitcoin finally breaks down within the next month or two when it does that marks the top for ethusd if it's not already in because the issue I think that I'm having right now is that it basically eth Bitcoin is already at the range low so what happens if it just slowly bleeds below 049 and eth USD is is still at you know 3600 or 3500 or whatever it is right now right 3489 so either either it needs to get a bounce and and kick the can down the road another month or two or it runs the risk of just capitulating into into April really really soon and and then maybe bottoming out sometime you know QT Q uh Q2 or Q3 the other way to look at ethereum is to potentially look at like the rist metric so the rist metric on eth right now is currently 74 um so it is pretty elevated it looks like it has gone all the way up to 752 risk at this point so it has gone up a lot and we also have this asset filter over here we can filter it by ethereum and look at a lot of the different charts for ethereum um we can look at the running wi your Roi if you're curious about that um you can almost draw sort of an imaginary trend line through here if you wanted to look at um the ROI after the cycle low for ethereum you can actually see that it's right where it was at this point last cycle and if you take it from May right I mean look where it is it's still doing exactly what it did I mean that honestly like that is probably some of the biggest counter evidence um to sort of the view that I presented the other view though is that while it is tracking it if you look at sort of the last two cycles at at some point you know they just sort of deviated they didn't track it forever um and so we know that diminishing returns is a thing and so if that is the case and we do get diminishing returns and if and if it sort of falls back down you could still have another rally uh later on but it you know maybe doesn't Peak until until much further out out um but yeah I I thought this was interesting and again you know so one one thing to sort of keep in mind again I'm not asking you to care about uh you know these other necessar any of these other altcoins but one thing to consider is that you know a lot of times I'll look at this stuff and it seems like it's going to follow the path um and then it doesn't right I mean like look at look at xrp I mean again this is this is something that again I don't I haven't bought xrp in Forever um but not too long ago it you know a lot of people were sort of looking at this chart or similar type of chart maybe not this one specifically and saying well this is when it's going to bounce and it it just never did um and you could look at at cardano and and say sort of similar things right like you know it was tracking the prior cycle at one point and then it really just kind of fell off right so I I I wouldn't look at this and assume that it has to follow it um but again I I I don't want to I I I don't just want it to be an echo chamber I know it kind of does devolved with that sometimes but this has some counter evidence okay um there's no such thing as a sure thing my view could be wrong and if it is wrong it's probably because it's following this path as opposed to the path that I I presented um so I would I would keep an eye on that uh as well for ethereum is does it continue to follow that I mean it has already deviated at points so I don't really know why it couldn't deviate again but that is something to think about and the other way to look at it is through the peak so if you look at it through the peak and you take it out to the next Peak you can see we are so far ahead of where we were at at this point in the prior cycle at this point in the prior cycle eth was still down 84% from its high 84% from a tie at this point in the last cycle I mean again I'm not saying that eth has to go down 84% from the ti but just to give you an idea of like what that means like what how bad it was back then that would put eth that $762 but that's just where it was there is diminishing volatility from one cycle to another diminishing losses just like diminishing returns but that's how far down it was last cycle one of my favorite charts recently maybe a bit of a coping chart ethusd denominated in chocolate cocoa it's actually below the 2022 low sometimes you really have to ask yourself is you know are asset prices going up because anything is fundamentally changed or are they just going up because of all the money Printing and everything's going up you know if everything is going up that's you know where inflation comes from so like well asset prices might seem like they've gone up they haven't when you factor in inflation so when you look at something like ethereum valued on some commodity that's been going parabolic it it doesn't really look as impressive and for me like this is what would have made more sense honestly um but crypto though is is very volatile right it's very volatile it often goes undervalued more than it should it then goes overvalued more than it should it just oscillates a lot in One Direction or the other even last cycle going into rate hikes you know or the PA we eth rallied 300% and then it fell 75% um or sorry this is valued in Coco but again like it it wouldn't be much different because I don't imagine it was so you can see it rallied about 350% and then it fell 75% if you look over here at ethusd it is r coincidentally 360% or so I mean not that different from what it did over there I'm not saying it has to fall 75% that was from a Black Swan but you know even if it fell 60% that puts it at 1,600 um 70% would put it at 1,200 75% would put it back near the range lows um but again I mean that doesn't have to happen immediately there's even some cases to be made that it could take a lot longer to play out um that might you know maybe the best example would be looking at at something like the the do era where you had things like you know uh not Costco Cisco you know put in a low in a midterm year and then it actually took that low out four years later right so I mean I I really hope that does not happen in the crypto right I I I would much prefer something like what we got last cycle where you know you you basically just get a a sort of midcycle top and then the market cools off for like six to nine months and then we get another rally in 2025 that is what I would prefer but if I'm wrong if my views are wrong which is entirely possible and if eth rallies you know beyond you know well beyond the prior highs or even well beyond where it is like I I I don't want to say it can't go higher if Bitcoin goes up it will take eth with it more than likely but if eth rallies like like way above the prior highs and and I'm just wrong flat out wrong on on the eth Bitcoin pair like if eth Bitcoin gets some massive bounce and eth starts to outperform I don't know what the narrative would be that people would follow maybe the spyf or eth gets approved or something I don't know then um I imagine you would just want to follow sort of the uh the the prior path and just you know without the sort of the the the catastrophe in between um so we'll see I mean we'll see how it how it plays out here if it if it does just continue to mimic sort of a a a bigger version of this or if it does something completely different because like the thing about this one is that I know a lot of people give me you know they don't like the fact that I I compare it to 2019 because it's gone up because it's been taking a lot longer but still because e Bitcoin continues to drop and because the FED has not yet pivoted why would we assume that it's not following the same thing because nothing has changed right it's still bleeding against Bitcoin the FED has not yet cut rates and that was the turning point for it at the midcycle top last cycle and by the way if you have a hard time with that you know like sort of a 6 to n month low in the market what's fascinating is that that everything's been shifted by about three quarters what if you shift this again you go three quarters out you get to the end of the year and then QE returns and you get another bullar market right I mean maybe that's maybe that's how plays out but anyways that those are my views I I wanted to express those I want to talk about ethereum it has been a while so I I did want to at least uh talk a little bit about some of the different things for ethereum um there's not a a whole lot of other things to really look at I mean we got a ton of charts on here if you guys want to go check it out into the cryptoverse decom we have the sales still going we're actually going to raise prices on um after the Bitcoin having so you can lock in low rate if you want um in addition we do have the sale right now so we're going to go up a good amount actually after after the having but um for you know for new people not for existing so check it out into the cryptoverse decom you have an asset filter you can really enter a lot of these different assets and find all the charts we have on them and then hopefully use those charts to make your own conclusions if you're curious about what this look sort of looks like this is the percent draw down from the all-time high um we've got a lot of different things on here here's here's an interesting one days since eth has dropped 30% 504 days days since it's dropped 50% 648 days and no wonder it feels like no one thinks it can actually ever go down again because it's been 648 days since I had a 50% drop but anyways I think we'll wrap it up there you guys know my general views on the market Bitcoin I do think is is going to take dominance I think Bitcoin dominance is going to 56% really soon and then I think 60% shortly thereafter um eth dominance is currently at 16.65% so if it breaks below here I would watch out below because things can move quickly um so do keep an eye on that especially as as eth Bitcoin is Fading Into the lows here as we get into April Bitcoin having it just seems like there's going to be a great chance that e Bitcoin breaks down and that this whole narrative we've been following finally plays out if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at in crypt.of",Youtube video,2024-03-29 00:00:00,"The video presents a technical analysis of Ethereum's price movements, particularly its performance against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC). The presenter believes that ETH/BTC is in a bear market and is likely to break support, potentially reaching the 0.03-0.04 range, which would represent a significant decline from current levels. This is attributed to the impact of monetary policy, with Ethereum being a riskier asset compared to Bitcoin.The video explores patterns in Ethereum's price action, drawing comparisons to the previous market cycle. It suggests that a breakdown in ETH/BTC could occur around the time of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. The presenter argues that this could lead to a large correction in Ethereum's USD price (ETH/USD), similar to the 50-75% drops observed in previous cycles when ETH/BTC broke down.The presenter also discusses the potential for Ethereum to follow a similar pattern to the previous cycle, where it rallies to new highs before eventually falling back to the lower end of its logarithmic regression band. This could happen if Bitcoin cools off during the summer, and ETH/BTC has already broken down.Additionally, the video examines Ethereum's risk metric, which is currently elevated, and compares its running ROI to the previous cycle. While there are some similarities, the presenter acknowledges that Ethereum may not necessarily follow the same path and could potentially deviate from the historical pattern.The presenter believes that Bitcoin dominance is likely to increase to 56% in the near future and potentially reach 60% shortly thereafter, as Ethereum's dominance currently stands at 16.65%. The presenter suggests that if Ethereum's dominance breaks below this level, it could signal further downside for the asset. The presenter also notes that the upcoming Bitcoin halving event could be a catalyst for the breakdown in the ETH/BTC pair, leading to a significant correction in Ethereum's USD price.Overall, the sentiment of the video is bearish on Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin in the near to medium term, with the presenter expecting ETH/BTC to break down and ETH/USD to experience a significant correction as a result of the ongoing tightening of monetary policy and the potential impact of the Bitcoin halving event.",447,"[0.0069503784, -0.015640259, 0.009902954, 0.0574646, -0.026657104,

Hi, today we're going to talk about fomc and how it relates to bitcoin if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom let's go and jump in so pal came out today um during the um uh during the the meeting and he basically said all the same things I I mean you know I listened to the whole thing and I didn't really hear many things that I hadn't already heard I think there were you know there was some interest in what the Dot Plot In the SCP would show the summary of economic projections there were some investors certainly thinking that there is a decent chance that they may roll back some of those rate cuts um especially considering that a lot of this inflation data is still sticky at 3% um so I think some people were sort of thinking that that might be the case maybe they would walk it back a little bit and say maybe only two rate Cuts this year but they didn't do that if you go look at the SCP um you know they're still saying you know three rate cuts are more than likely and so because of that because of that um sort of Revelation what ended up happening is now the odds of a rate cut in June have jumped all the way up to 73 uh or to get to 5 and a quarter by June 73.1% chance and even a 6.2% chance that you're at 5% by June meaning there's only about a 20.8% chance about one in five that the FED doesn't cut in June according to the current probabilities now this stuff changes there is a chance they could cut in May I mean I mean it depends on what happens between now and then but right now the market is speculating that June will be the most likely outcome for a rate cut and so when you think about rate Cuts right we've talked before about you know what it's going to look like what it would likely look like what it's historically look like and one of the things I've mentioned many many times is what does Bitcoin do going into rate Cuts now unfortunately we don't have a ton of data I mean we legitimately have one example one example so at the end of the day you know there there's not a whole lot that can be learned from a single example I can go through that example like we have and say that well this is what happened last time it doesn't mean that it's going to play out the same way we have a data point of one right but given that we have a data point of one it might at least be worthwhile to know what happened during that time right not to say that it has to happen like that but just say you know what given this one data point that we have what actually happened when the FED cut rates now what's interesting is the Fed is still projecting three rate cuts the reason why I find that interesting is because in 2019 we had three rate Cuts we had one rate cut in July where they went from 2 and a half% down to 2.25 and then we had another rate cut in October really we had one in September and then October so it was July September October they were all 25 basis point rate Cuts so we essentially went from 2.5 to 1.75 now the reason why I find it interesting is it almost feels like a carbon copy of 2019 in terms of what is the most likely outcome based on the current probabilities right so you have three 25 basis point rate Cuts starting from 2 and a half now we are at 5 and a half three 25 basis point rate Cuts would get us to 4 75 which by the way if you go look at the summary of economic projections that's essentially where the FED has Us by the end of the year is at around 4.75% so because of the similarities I think it's so relevant to make the comparison but note that the environment the macro environment is different than it was in 2019 right it's not the exact same setup and I don't think the people should assume it's the exact same setup but what happened back then is that Bitcoin rallied into the First Rate cut we have been talking about this idea what seems like forever you know I mean we've been talking about this you know even when they were raising rates we we said that look last cycle Bitcoin rallied until until the First Rate cut actually arrived and and it actually topped out one month before the First Rate cut arrived so when we think about that maybe it's worthwhile to think about well if it plays out like 2019 and if Bitcoin were to top out one month before the First Rate cut you can find the reasoning for why we spent a lot of time sort of daydreaming about when the First Rate Cut's going to actually come because it might mean something right it might mean something for the crypto now what you should know is that when the First Rate cut arrived it's not like Bitcoin just capitulated I mean it it it essentially hung around the highs for several months before before ultimately dropping below its bullmark sport band but again it topped out one month before the First Rate cut right one month Market topped in June the rate cut came in July so when we think about the fed and and what they're you know sort of what they're most likely to do we said they're probably not going to cut in March right it doesn't make sense especially with all this inflation data still printing at 3% and the unemployment rate is still below 4% Powell did say though that um let me find some of these quotes he said it will likely become appropriate to dial back policy restraint at some point this year he said um what else did he say he said that strong hiring would not be a reason to hold off on rate Cuts so again I mean it seems like he's really pushing the idea that rate cuts are coming uh if there were a significant weakening in the data particularly the labor market there could also be a reason for us to begin the process of reducing rates there's nothing in the data pointing to that one of the things that was interesting was that he talked about you know if there's a surprise right well the issue is that the FED is only really projecting out 4% unemployment you know for the year right they're only really projecting out 4% unemployment rate you can see it right here and so it wouldn't take a lot to surprise or say to quote unquote surprise the FED because the unemployment rate rate is already at 3.9% so I don't think you know I don't really think it would take a lot to theoretically surprise them I don't really think they would be surprised they might play it off like they're surprised to justify the rate cut but I mean it just seems likely that at some point between now and the end of the year given the pace of the unemployment rate has been going up like it seems likely that we're going to go above 4% now I could be wrong right I could I certainly could be wrong about that but just seems like we're likely going to go about four % and I I think when we do that will justify the first cut right so will the FED cut in May will they cut in May Market says probably not right says probably not a cut in May in fact only a 7.9% chance if they were to cut in May which is a big F right if they were to cut in May and Bitcoin were to follow the pattern from last cycle during quantitative tiing quantitative tightening and high rate it would imply Bitcoin tops in April a local top right calm down right but that's what it would imply again over here it had a top we cooled off for a while and then we went up more later on after we had sort of the pandemic crash um but that was a Black Swan that you know it's can't really prepare for that sort of stuff so going back to this idea if we get a rate cut in May then it will imply a local top in April meaning a local top into the having right the Bitcoin having but the Market's not currently expecting a rate cut in May the Market's expecting a rate cut in June pretty good odds right now that we're going to get one in June and it seems to me that it's relatively likely that it'll happen by June and the reason I say that is because I mean they are wanting to do three rate Cuts this year if you think about the way they ended did rate hikes they went to basically like 25 basis points pause 25 basis point pause right like they they sort of sprinkle them in with pauses in between and so we only have six more meetings this year that they theoretically need to fit three rate rate cuts into okay so if they want to do cut Paul's cut Paul's cut then they need to either start in May or June right because if they start in may they can do May July November but I'm guessing because the election they might not want to cut in November just to not influence or not not to be seen as influencing that so what I think there's a good chance that could happen here is cut in June cut in September cut in December right so June September M December so if that's the case right if that's the case and they don't cut in May and if Bitcoin follows what it did in 2019 then it means the top is in May right if it if it follows sort of suit of what happened in 2019 it would imply that you have a local top approximately two months from now now if you look at what Bitcoin has been doing over here what's really interesting about this this is that we and we talked about this a little bit in the video yesterday if you look at at at at what it's been doing you know we basically had a local low over here at 39K in late January and now it's late March and we just had a another big wick to the downside right so about two months apart so if we were to take sort of a a range here from here to here that was about 19 weeks and then from here to here it was only about 8 weeks right but again eight weeks between that low and then this low right here and what you'll see is that after this low Bitcoin rallied for seven weeks until the local top was in right seven weeks now I don't know if this is a low or not it could be it could also go a little bit further down and get closer to the 8we SME um I know I really don't I mean I don't really care to be completely honest but I you know if you were to go seven weeks from this Wick 7 weeks out puts you when it puts you the week of May 6 the week of May 6 so I think that there is some reason some reason based on the one data point that we have that I'm not asking you to take to the bank right but there's some some reason to think that hey what if it plays out like that right what if you know what if it's just doing the same thing once again where we you know sort of pull back into the end of the month and then we get into the following month and then the market goes back up right I mean because we've had a pretty big pump here by Bitcoin today but we're still off the highs right we're still not at 73k and so what happened back over here in January is that it it came down here and then it essentially Consolidated for about 3 weeks or so right you basically had a 3 we consolidation period and then the fourth week got you back up to the highs right the fourth week we're currently in week number two okay so what that might imply again I don't know but what it might imply is one more consolidation week after this one get us through the end of March then in April you you sort of see that move back up to the r so that could theoretically happen now where where there could be a wrench thrown into this plan is if there's a rate cut in May right if there's a rate cut in May then you know waiting until May for a local top might not prove the most ideal because it could imply that a top comes sooner than that um and I I think that is is is something we have to and again there's no way to know I mean there's still a chance they cut in May I think the only way they would really cut in May is if something catastrophic happened were to happen in the economy or if say the unemployment rate printed 4% right if the unemployment rate prints 4% or say like 4.1 4.2 when we get the data here in a couple of weeks then I could Envision a scenario where they might cut in May right but for now base case is they cut in June and if you think about it it kind of makes sense when you think about the timing of everything because you had sort of this drop in late January and then in the early part of February the market sort of got that labor market data after getting the labor market data still seeing that we were below 4% the market took off right so I wonder if that's happening again right where it's it's sort of in this consolidation Zone but it's also sort of not yet taking off the new highs because perhaps it's waiting for that labor market data to confirm that hey things are still relatively okay for now so if the unemployment rate were to come in in April if it were to come in at you know at a relatively okay number and it doesn't scare the FED then it might not scare the markets because they assume the fed's not going to cut If the Fed decides they need to cut based on this then it could push the rate cut up to May implying that April could be the more significant month to take a look at but for now let's just go with a base case that the market is saying June 73% by the way I it was advertised in 2019 I mean I remember they said like oh well the fed's advertiser going to cut at the next meeting so in May perhaps they will advertise a rate cut will come in June okay and if that's the case once it's advertised that could sort of be where things get a little you know flaky if you will because again the meeting is going to be on May 1 May 1st you draw this out right from this low to this low here or to the high it was seven weeks so from that low seven weeks out that puts you may 6 the week of May 6 so just after the FED meeting you know imagine you get a scenario where the FED announces a rate cut occurring in June and then on on the unemployment rate it prints 4% or something or 4.1 or you know 4 something you know and then the market might say well okay fine they have to cut because the labor market is showing weakness so I I I do wonder if if that is is you know a case to consider and it's hard because again we only have we only have one data point right I mean I don't know if it's going to play out the same way or not um but that's just what happened last time and if you look closely here what you'll see is is kind of a very similar pattern in terms of like when the FED paused Bitcoin initially sold off and then it rallied fairly aggressively for a while right what you'll notice is that it first rallied and then Consolidated it then rallied and then Consolidated for a smaller period of time held the8 we as support and then it got one final move up right now look over here right you have a very similar type of thing where you get your first you get your pause and then the market sells off right so the market sold off right there Market sold off right here and then it rallied up and then Consolidated for a few weeks right rallied up Consolidated for a few weeks and then from there it spiked again and then had a pretty sharp draw down to the 8we Ese and then one final move up right same thing right pretty sharp move down um or sorry rallied up and then a pretty sharp move down so far hasn't reached the eight-week moving average we'll talk about that in a couple of minutes and then you know is this is this what has to come next right same thing kind of over here you had a sell off this was not during rate hikes but you had a sell off a move up consolidation for a few weeks a move up a smaller consolidation and then a final move right so you had one two three right one two three and then the sort of the equivalent is like one two and then whatever three is happens between now and and may they tend to come like in these sort of these moves three right this was also one two three but the reason why you know I a lot of people say well why don't you do more price predictions first of all like I I've done price prediction in the past everyone loves them and and then they hate you is essentially what happens because every every everyone always changes their price prediction you know they'll put out a prediction and then they it reaches that level they just push it higher right until eventually they're wrong so um rather than doing that my view as I've said before is that Bitcoin needs to go high enough to break altcoins off of their Bitcoin support levels now the the the the the djones I mean look they have my respect I mean they've been keeping up with Bitcoin fairly well for a while Bitcoin dominance has still gone higher so I still think Bitcoin is the better place to be um from a risk adjust returns returns perspective there's a difference between like you know your absolute return and your risk adjusted return you know like a large you know say like an Institutional Investor they might be okay buying Bitcoin and getting a you know 2 to 3x or something they're not going to go buy a random meme coin right um so that's why I say like it it's so hard to know like what that would correspond to you know does it get the same type of aggressive move you know in these three cases right where you had one two and three one two and three and then one two and three or does it get kind of like a muted move right where you get one two and then the third one was a new high but only barely a new high you know and I I don't know I mean I I really don't know the answer to that question um I think you could find evidence to support both views I think that if it plays out like that it could be because the unemployment rate starts to show concerns in April you know and that might mute the returns for Bitcoin and it you know and if it does rally back up to the highs maybe it sweeps the highs goes you know a little bit higher or something um but it doesn't go a lot above it or if on the other hand the unemployment rate in April looks okay and it's still below 4% and the FED doesn't cut in May then perhaps you get something a little bit more aggressive right my point is that I at least my view of the market and a lot of people might disagree with me and hey I mean I I do think people are there's a lot of people that are better at predicting the market than I am but I will say I don't really think anyone can know for sure what's going to happen because it's going to be dependent on variables that we just can't know um so I would say my view and I've said this before is that Bitcoin goes high enough to break these altcoins off of their support levels right they're all Bitcoin dominance videos right to to to break alt off of their support levels remember all Bitcoin pairs broke support one month before the First Rate cut last cycle one month meaning right meaning in 2019 they fell in June Bitcoin topped in June but then Bitcoin rolled over after all Bitcoin pairs had fallen down and then and then the FED started to cut rates not that the FED cares about your altcoin they don't but my understanding of the market which could be flawed is that when alts break assuming they do if and when they break off of their support then it's sort of an indication that the retail sort of the consumer is is slowing down right the consumer is starting to slow down and so that's why the FED might cut rates um but again you know if if the if the Fed Cuts rates in May which doesn't really seem like the most likely scenario now then perhaps you see all Bitcoin pairs break down in April If the Fed doesn't cut rates until June then they might not break down until May right so I I I do think that um you know when you think about what would it take for altcoins to break their Bitcoin support levels I I think it's going to take something in the economic data to to to force the FED to cut right and and that just hasn't happened yet and I don't know when it's going to happen I would say my general view is risk on until 56% Bitcoin dominance because at 56% all Bitcoin pairs have broken down right they've broken down now the question is is well you know can can we hit 56% dominance in April I think there's a good chance that we could I do um but I also could see it happening early may as well for the reasons we just mentioned right I mean it it it's possible that it takes until like that first or second week of May to to see those altcoins break off their Bitcoin support levels um and if that is the case then you know it's just a couple weeks after maybe a few weeks after the having so that is what I would be looking for here and again you know if you're if you're wondering if if if you don't care about Bitcoin and you don't care about Bitcoin dominance and you're like how's this useful to me basically all this stuff means is like you know the party goes on until they break support once they break support that's it for a while more than likely again I could be wrong and it could be that it plays out differently this time I'm just basing it off the single data point that we have um so what I would suspect happens is that all Bitcoin pairs slowly turn the corner here and start to make their way back to down to the range lows in April that is what I suspect and it might take until late April early May for them to actually go below it but that is ultimately what I would expect to see happen so you could have something like this right where it it rolls over slowly comes back down here maybe bounces rejected off the bullmark work band and then down you could see something like that you know eth Bitcoin held up a little bit longer last cycle than alt it it took it didn't break down until the month of rate Cuts so you could have an example with eth Bitcoin where it doesn't break down until whenever the FED Cuts rates like you know it could be June or it could be it could be may now it didn't it it broke down when the FED Cut Rate but um you know you know give or take a week or so so I mean it could still theoretically come in May um but and you might say well eth Bitcoin is near the range lows right now yeah it is and that's a little concerning um to be completely honest but if if if it bounces off the range low you know perhaps it goes back up to the bow Mark work ban and then rolls over into sort of like April May and then Falls below and it maybe it falls below sometime in like May or June or even April right I don't know I mean I'm I I said previously that the earliest it would revisit the these lows the range lows would likely be March and here we are it's March I'm kind of surprised that it's backed down to these levels this quickly because in 2019 it actually took after the bounce that it had it it bled a lot slower to get back down and it took until May just to get back down there but you can see once it tagged this trend line right you had a low and then a lower low and then you tagged the trend line again it bounced one last time up to the bull Mark wor band and then finally it fell below it about a month and a half two months later right so you say you have the same thing right you have a low then you have a lower low we're now testing that level again and we also already tested it though so like has it already run its course I don't really know but it is you know we are getting really close to to Breaking that so whether it breaks here or you know again a decent chance too that it it it you know it hangs around for a little bit for a few more weeks and then breaks down um but that is what I'm looking at here as as far as rate Cuts go and how relates to bitcoin the reason why that's important for Bitcoin is because as as long as eth Bitcoin is up here it implies there's some liquidity from eth it's going to make its way back over to bitcoin that's the implication now of course there's a lot of people talking about like this spot ETF stuff for ethereum potentially being denied and and and you know there's you know sort of fud about it being in security I think all that's noise I mean I just think it's based on monetary policy last cycle e Bitcoin broke down on the First Rate cut and it bottomed when QE returned right it bottomed when QE returned so what if it just does the same thing what if it breaks down on the First Rate cut and then it bottoms when QE returns maybe it's as simple as that you know so again I think a lot of that other stuff is noise I I would just look at it in terms of in terms of monetary policy is is how I view it um but going back to bitcoin you know what I would say in the short term is that this move on The Daily obviously looks impressive right it looks impressive um you what I would say though is that what you really want to see is follow through by this move because this was a strong daily candle back up to the upside so you really would want to see follow through now if you want to go ahead and run the highs right you know just one day where it continues to go up if it doesn't do that if you know if it if it just kind of Fades back in you could get one more move down where you where you sort of tag that low back over here and the only reason I say that is because as long as we're above the 8we ese the the the trend remains intact right now the 8we ese is currently at at around 57.9k right it's just below 58k and this level here is at like 59k so if Bitcoin sustains the current move then we might not even go down there and test it at all anytime soon but if tomorrow or if today it's unable to see follow through on the move into the 70k range and it bleeds back down let's say you get another long wig down that's the level I would be looking at to see if it can hold the 8we as support by the end of the month if you look at 2021 right if you look at this move over here in 2021 what you'll see is that you had a you know two two red candles down and then in the third candle it was green but you still ran the lows and you went to the eight-week moving average if you look at 2019 right if you look at at um 2019 we had sort of a two- we move to the downside and then this candle while it went back up it still hugged the lows for you know some point during that week so I I I know that everyone's excited and and honestly like you know I I I don't mean to to um uh sort of get you off that honestly um but I I would say that you know if there is a pullback again I would say look at that range low right there at at just below 60k and perhaps as the 8we SMA is coming up to that level right like right there we've already gotten pretty close to that you know so I'm not not saying that like you know you should base your investing decisions on it it or anything like that but um if there is sort of another run of the lows or even a wick a little bit lower I would say that would be your level because remember over here we went basically to like 38 39K this right there would be 58 59k we already went to 60k I'm not trying to split hairs I'm just saying like you know that's something to think about um if you were to see that going into the end of March if you look by the way at at just say like year-to dat Roi of Bitcoin and you compare it to 2021 right and some people say why do you compare to 2021 why not compare it to the having years well first of all we're outperforming the having years right look at it that's 2014 this is 2016 and this is 2012 So currently Bitcoin is outperforming all prior having years and then I was thinking you know if you think about it last year outperformed all or the average of the pre having years right um but if you look at last year and you compare it to El or having year returns you can see that last year mimicked having year returns so if last year mimicked having year returns maybe this year we'll have some you know resemblance to post hav a returns right and you can see that in 2021 right we rallied up until about the same point Day 72 or so into the mon into the year and we faded back down here we bottomed on day 84 we're currently on day 81 and then it rallied back up up into April right it rallied up into April to about a 2.14 2.17 x off the lows right and you can see that this first little top there was nowhere close to that one this one got a lot closer what if this one gets even closer right I mean Bitcoin started the year off at 42k right so 2x would be 84 I put you in the middle 80s I don't know if bitcoin's going to go that high it's possible I would say that what it needs to do is it just needs to break all coins off their support levels so when I think about that I say look I don't know you know I know everyone loves all these price predictions that everyone's given out and and there's some pretty lofty ones that I've seen but my view is that I don't know if it's going to do something like that where it runs the highs everyone piles in thinking it's going to go up higher and then it just sort of Fades or if it actually goes up higher I think the the way to to get an idea is to whether it's going to play out like that where it's sort of a muted third Rally or whether you actually get sort of a real third rally I think the way to get insight into that is if alts have broken down or not right if Bitcoin runs the highs and all Bitcoin pairs have broken down then like I'm not going to be thinking to myself well now Bitcoin needs to go higher I'm just going to be thinking well this is where you know this is where Bitcoin turned around in 2019 just before rate Cuts arrived it also might depend on the timing right if if it's April and it seems like the First Rate cut is not going to occur until June then maybe there's still time for it to run but if we get into April and the unemployment rate prints 4% and then all of a sudden all these rate Cuts get shifted forward a month then you might have less time and then perhaps it would end up being sort of a muted Peak where it runs the highs but doesn't go that much higher but you know I I think that you could make a case either way for now for now I I think that you have to be open right you have to be open to seeing um something like that right where it it it basically gets that final move to to break the altcoins off of their support levels I've been saying forever risk on until 56% Bitcoin dominance risk on until 56% Bitcoin dominance right we're following it almost to a t right you test it you test it again and then you come back down to the bull Mark support band hold it as support or get close to it and then you blast off through it right we tested it we tested it again we've come back down to the bullmark SP band and you can see that it's slowly starting to go back up right it's slowly starting to go back up and so the risk sort of the the signal that you look for is that one when it takes out that high right that's what you look for and the hard part for me is like I you know I'd love to give a price associated with that but how can I know like how can I know how much the altcoins are going to pump relative to bitcoin they've been more resilient than I thought they'd be and I'll tip my hat I can't know right so it's just how long does it actually take um and and I mean you can see it's spending Bitcoin Dominus is spending a lot of time at these range highs right spending a lot of time at those range highs so I think it's going to slowly move up and then I I think we're going to get a week or two where it just moves up very aggressively and then it actually closes up here and then and then we'll have to take inventory on on where everything is because you know that is is is something that I I think is extremely relevant right now um for this Market is the fact that Bitcoin dominance is slowly building up and I I see all these people on on on on X and and in YouTube that you know sort of take take sta you know take sort of like Jabs at the Bitcoin dominance views that that sort of the bullish dominance views um and I you know I will say I could be wrong you know um some people have pointed out like you know what if what if all Bitcoin pairs are are in in whiteoff accumulation rather than on the verge of breaking down and I look I I only say that because I want you to know that there are other opinions out there that might be right and I could be wrong I could be wrong that's a reality that I have to face um and honestly I mean you know if if this is wof accumulation on all Bitcoin pairs I might might see myself out of the cryptoverse for a while um but I I will say that I I do think that they are likely going to break down for the reasons I've explained uh many times and I think that you know over here it was a Bitcoin rally where they broke down it was a Bitcoin rally there are cases where they break where they break down on bitcoin dumps so I I don't want to give you the impression that it's a sure thing wouldn't that be something if we you know if everyone goes into the having thinking we're going to get this massive pump and then we just and then we just drop instead and and then they break down on a dump instead of a pump like it can happen I've seen it happen it's just not as it's not as frequent right like it's not as frequently that happens that's why I say like you know you should have your bias for one thing but say look if the if the data starts toest to suggest otherwise and you have to flip that bias so what would cause me to flip that view well I've said before the 8we as long as we're above the 8we the uptrend is intact look at what killed the rally in 2021 look at what killed the rally once we got below the 8 week look what killed it in 2019 once we got below the 8 we now we already did go below it very briefly but again it was it was a fake out now that sounds like a cop out and it kind of is you know it's only obvious in hindsite um but I said back over here right if if you don't actually go to the um to the bullmark sport band then it could end up being a fake out but if you start to get you know multiple weekly closes below the 8we moving average then I I think that sort of the bias has to flip but we're not there right now right we're still well above the 8we estimate in fact Bitcoin would have to drop from the current levels I mean it' have to drop about 15% 14 15% just to get back to the eight-week moving average the only reason I keep bringing it up is because we've seen sort of all these prior drops were about 20 to 22% right 20 to 22% even this one over here in January and so far this one has been about 17 to 18% so I don't know if it needs to go down any further if you look at 2019 the drop that it had was only about 18% or so I think yeah it was about 17 18% right it didn't go it didn't go any further down than this right it was around 17.7 n% or so that's that's essentially what we what we're at right we've already seen that so I I don't want to give you the impression that it has to go to the 8-week estimate it certainly does not and even in 2019 it didn't I mean if you it looks like it did but if you zoom in it didn't actually go there on this red week the next week it hit it but it was only because the 8we SME increased up to it right over here the 8we ese was at like 7,000 then here it was at like 7500 so I mean you could have an example where it does go to the 8we SMA but if you think about where the 8we ese is and it continues sort of slowly go up next week the 8we ese could be at that low so even if you do get another Wick to the downside it might not go any lower than the prior one or even slightly lower but it could correspond to testing that 8we moving average so as long as the 8-week moving average holds then I think that the uptrend is intact below the 8we SMA it's still not a suar thing because you have sort of this case and point right here where I think things change is if you go to the 20we estimate right down here I don't think the Bulls want to go to the bull marks we been at this point three months ago I think it would have been okay right but history shows when you go you know more than 3 to four months we're now at you know 22 weeks when you go that long you're not going to hold it more than likely whenever you do test it right so that's why I'm saying like I I don't I don't think the Bulls want to go to the bullmark s in at this point I I think that in order for this to continue we we we likely will need to stay above the we SME if the Bulls give up the 8we SME and we go to the bull market support band that's where things start to get a bit more dicey right and so that's why it's not obvious right it's certainly not obvious um but I I think it it all comes back to all Bitcoin pairs it comes back to you know to to to bitcoin doin right to eth bitcoin the pieces of the puzzle are there I would encourage you not to you know forget about them because just as the Euphoria Creeps in it's easy to ignore all the things we've talked about for years right for years now my view for the last two years has just been Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio right I mean you can look at all this stuff and say well you know there's probably something bad happening on the other side of it but that doesn't mean that you just walk around with you know only cash right um so I I think I I think that the riskof signal is when all Bitcoin pairs break down but look they haven't broken down yet and I don't know how long it's going to take going back to what we previously SPO spoke about we know that last cycle they broke down one month before the First Rate cut which is where Bitcoin USD topped the First Rate cut is potentially coming in June so maybe May is that is the window if the First Rate cut is shifted to May then perhaps April is the window if you get a cut in May then I think you're more likely to to just sort of run the high but not really go that much higher right kind of like this kind of like what happened over here right so if the First Rate cut comes in in April then you might do something like that if the First Rate cut comes in or sorry no if the First Rate cut comes in May then you might do something like this where you get sort of a tempered move in that third move if the first cut does not come until June then you could have something a little bit more aggressive than that right where you actually go up you know considerably higher than the prior high right and I I've had a lot of people ask me about you know different indicators that we've talked about and you know some of them have already flashed right we talked about gold um gold is is is putting in new highs and I think the reason is because you know the FED came out and confirmed that you know rate cuts are coming right gold really likes to go back to monetary policy especially if it sniffs out you know some some labor market weakness and that sort of stuff so it it's continuing to put in new highs uh which definitely makes sense I'm pretty long-term bullish on gold um but the other thing that I've mentioned is the usct dominance now I just want to say one last thing about this and I'm not going to keep bringing it up we've talked about this trend line for a while and I I spoke about this trend line back over here I said look guys it could very well break to these to these levels and come back to the trend line I'm not asking you to take it to the bank I'm not I don't I don't look at diagonal trend lines and assume they have to hold it could hold right and if it does it will have seemed obvious but they don't have to hold I think what's more relevant is to look at horizontal support levels so you can see that this support level is the same support level as here if we go below that level then the level that you look at I think is right here from November 2021 where the US dominance would be at around 2.4% so if we go below you know 3.75% the next level of support on USC dominance in my view is around 2.4% I just wanted to clarify that I don't take stable coin dominance trend lines especially diagonal trend lines to the bank look at the horizontal support levels we've hit one of them we've bounced a little bit and you can see that like it's almost bounced up to the 8we estimate itself but not quite so if next week you know if it's if it's definitively rolling back around then at the very least you'll probably come back and retest this trend line just like we saw it retest multiple times in March of 2021 April you know February March and April May of 2021 but I mean those are essentially my views you know on on on monetary policy on rate cuts and and all that stuff um and I hope they're useful I don't intend that said everything that I said is going to be true in fact most of it probably won't be true but that is my view that we can at least talk about with the market and I wouldn't I wouldn't even necessarily go as far as say it's my view it's just like this is what happened last time we had R Cuts who knows if that's what happens again but this is what happened last time again I don't base my own investment decisions on it I just stick to the risk levels whatever they're doing I I'll follow those but this I'm just trying to provide some commentary on the market and I I think that we are getting really close to rate cuts my guess is either May or June is my guess I mean it's possible they go out until July but I think the issue with that is that then you're going to have to do two back to back in order to sneak in three before the end of the year and they're probably not going to want to do it in November so I'm guessing you know they might do one in December and September and maybe June June July sorry June September December so that might be the most likely outcome um for the rest of the year or if not if if the economic data weakens quickly then maybe you know it be May July and and then December or something um but that's where we stand um hopefully you guys enjoyed the content remember to subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the

interest rate cuts on the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin. It analyzes the historical patterns observed during the previous rate cut cycle in 2019, drawing parallels to the current situation. The video suggests that Bitcoin may follow a similar trajectory, potentially rallying into the first rate cut before experiencing a local top around a month prior. However, the presenter acknowledges that the current macroeconomic environment is different, and the outcome may not be identical.The video delves deeper into the potential scenarios, noting that if the first rate cut is delayed until June, Bitcoin may have more time to run higher, potentially reaching new highs. Conversely, if the rate cuts are shifted forward to May, the presenter suggests that the Bitcoin rally may be more muted, similar to the 2019 pattern. The presenter emphasizes the importance of monitoring the timing of the rate cuts and the overall economic data to determine the future direction of the crypto market.The video also discusses the relationship between Bitcoin dominance and altcoin performance, highlighting the historical patterns where altcoins tend to break down against Bitcoin prior to the first rate cut. The presenter acknowledges that this pattern may not necessarily repeat, and there is a possibility that altcoins could be in a quiet accumulation phase instead. However, the presenter maintains that the risk-on signal is when Bitcoin dominance breaks above the 56% level, as this has typically coincided with altcoin underperformance.The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with the presenter highlighting the importance of closely following the developments in the macroeconomic environment and the Fed's policy decisions to identify potential trading opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.",338,"[0.02949524, 0.037994385, -0.016723633, -0.029037476, 0.018554688, -0.0005540848, -0.045288086, -0.0541687, 0.058654785, -0.024673462,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin but more specifically we're going to talk about everyone's favorite topic Bitcoin dominance One Shining Moment if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse go and jump in so you may be wondering why are we calling it One Shining Moment uh well I'm glad you asked the reason is because well March Madness has arrived and in the same way a year ago we did a Bitcoin dominance video One Shining Moment when Bitcoin dominance was at about 48% I thought why not do the same thing today A year later a full year later and now the Bitcoin dominance has moved from 48% up to around that that 54 uh% level so it's been a year it's taken a long time to move from 48% to 54% and certainly during that entire time there have been a lot of altcoins that have done well against Bitcoin but as I've said more times than I care to count it does not detract from the overall trend that some alts are outperforming a majority of them are and likely will continue to bleed back to the king now in the same way that we did this last year with One Shining Moment We will have another into the cryptoverse March Madness bracket Challenge and so to join the group uh you just follow the link in the description below or the pinned comment and you will need to enter in a pass password the password uh I will also put down there but it is BTC DOD that is the password all right you get one uh one team or one bracket I should say and whoever wins will get a year a free year subscription to into the cryptoverse so again doesn't cost you a thing to sign up links in the description below and hopefully I will uh see a lot of people signing up it's always a lot of fun because I mean I I think it's fun I mean if you're not in the states and you might not even know what I'm talking about but essentially it's it's college basketball tournament and I at least like watching it so um if you are interested links in the description below fill out a bracket and we'll have some fun uh providing updates on on sort of who's in the lead at various points we did the same thing last year um so check that out so I mean as far as Bitcoin dominance goes this is probably not going to be nearly as long as As some of the Bitcoin dominance videos that I do basically because I'm really not feeling that well which why should today be any different than any other day but I just don't really feel like talking for an hour and a half um especially considering that dominance well has been at the same level that it's been at um you know essentially for the last half year I mean in October we were at 54% uh and we're we're at that same level so you know essentially I could probably just re-upload the same video the last video I did on bit coin dominance a couple of weeks ago about 3 weeks ago when Bitcoin dominance was at 52% and nothing's really changed I mean dominance has gone up about a percent but I mean all the arguments that I made in that video hold true through today but I will touch on on a few of the main points okay and and some of those points revolve around this Crescendo of Bitcoin dominance into the hav into rate Cuts coming sometime this year more than likely right now when we think about dominance and what it has accomplished what what's really fascinating about about dominance is that you know it certainly has given the impression to a lot of people that it's constantly breaking down I can't tell you how many people I've argued with about about this over the last couple of years but when you take a step back I mean it it really just moves up and then consolidates and again up and consolidates and it just keeps on doing it over and over and over again but no matter how high it goes and then we get a pullback there's always people out there that then say see I told you so right it's not going up but what's fascinating to me with dominance is if you look at like monthly candles monthly hiashi candles they've literally been green since December of 2022 right so I I get all these messages from people saying like you know what if what if dominance doesn't go up um and I'm like well why don't why don't you go ask the people that have been bearish on bitcoin dominance for the last two years what they're doing considering that it has been in a macro uptrend the entire time and it has been Faded by a lot of people the entire time for some reason and again guys it's not personal with the altcoins I've said many times there are many altcoins that are outperforming Bitcoin there's always some that do but again it does not detract from the overall trend that Bitcoin has been outperforming most altcoins again is there some micro cap that was created in October that's up 10,000% that you're going to use to say well who cares perhaps but the point is is I I said back then that there would be some altcoins that outperform most of the ones that have outperformed are newer altcoins because they don't have the same baggage that a lot of the older altcoins have that's not to say that none of the older altcoins haven't pumped some of them have but most of them have bled to bitcoin fairly consistently for a long time and so again you know I said it's not personal when it comes to the altcoin market right it's just the way the crypto verse has worked you know and and I I I think there's this disconnect that people have between you know what happens during a bull run that's occurring during quantitative tightening and a bull run that's occurring during quantitative easing and you know and again like the sort of the the poster child for that is is the eth Bitcoin pair I mean there are so many people that tell me that eth Bitcoin or that that the ethereum Bitcoin valuation that eth will outperform Bitcoin in the bull run and you know I'm not disputing that at some nebulous point in the future that that can happen What I Am disputing is the fact that while it has been said since the merge that eth Bitcoin will outperform that eth will do well against Bitcoin because of the deflationary aspect of the tokenomics you know whatever now it's the spot ETF despite all of that despite all of it right if you were to go look at quarterly returns for eth Bitcoin what you will notice once again is that it is now read five quarters in a row right I mean all of 2023 was read and so far q1 of 2024 is read look at the table right I mean so either the table's wrong or the narratives are wrong you know narratives are great right I mean they they a lot of people get behind narratives especially when it's going their way but when when you're following a narrative about you know tokenomics and whatnot and you're still watching the higher risk asset bleed to bitcoin maybe the narrative isn't that important maybe it's monetary policy that's more important in that situation now some people have said that that you know because eth Bitcoin is down since the merge then that represents a failure of the transition from proof of work to proof of State I'm not there right I'm actually long-term bullish on on ethereum but Bitcoin is not as risky and the fact of the matter just as we've seen in the stock market money flows to the safer asset and we're going through the same process that ethereum's Bitcoin valuation has gone through two previous times so when you look at dominance it's building up to a crescendo right there there's this Crescendo that it seems like we're in right now and that's why I've called it One Shining Moment yes it was One Shining Moment last year too and we saw what happened right Bitcoin dominance was able to break out of this level right you guys remember that now it took a while right I mean it it still took some time it didn't occur until June but is it not the same thing is it not just slowly building up to it and then one week this will happen and it will just break through and is it likely that at some point in the future when Bitcoin dominance theoretically pulls back to 55% that'll be seen as bearish and people will dunk on it once again yeah probably but the point is is that it has been an uptrend for a long time now one of the reason reasons why we followed this is because again when you think about how do you how do you maximize your risk adjusted returns you know do you want to be heavy Bitcoin do you want to be heavy alts do you want to have some type of combination when it comes to eth bitcoin right so many people say that eth will outperform Bitcoin in a bull run but the people that say that I I think only are looking at the 2021 bull run I'm going to end up going an hour aren't I the the people that are looking at it they're only looking at the 2021 Bull Run when eth Bitcoin went up during the bull run that was a QE bull run when the Fed was increasing the size of their balance sheet right increasing the size of their balance sheet and we were operating at essentially zero interest rates right 0% right we're near the lower bound here 0.25% so you can see that during a QE Bull Run eth Bitcoin the eth Bitcoin pair went up meaning that eth outperformed Bitcoin in that bull run and so a lot of people said well since it out formed back over there it should outform it here as well but they set it at 008 and 007 and 06 right and now they're saying it at 0.05 that you know that sort of that gist you wait it's going to outperform but what I would retort with is this we had a very similar Bull Run by Bitcoin in 2019 that by the way mimics a lot of what we've been seeing over here but what happened was that Bitcoin rallied over 300% at higher rates and during a period where the Federal Reserve was decreasing the size of their balance sheet and so when you have that combination of high rates and QT quantitative tightening what happened yes Bitcoin rallied into it but eth Bitcoin fell same thing right High rates QT what's happening bitcoin's rallying into it but eth Bitcoin fell so the whole idea right I mean you know the whole idea here is that while I know a lot of people are are sort of reminiscing about what happened in 2021 and late 2020 and they saw the eth Bitcoin pair go up a lot I would just say guys I mean if you join in 2021 if you miss what happened in 2019 during very similar monetary policy in fact it's worse today in terms of you know we're at higher rates but in terms of a very similar monetary policy you would have seen firsthand how eth bled to bitcoin and I saw it firsthand I I feel like I learned a lot I feel like I learned a ton in this Bitcoin rally because even after the Bitcoin rally was over Bitcoin dominance kept on going up and so that's why this cycle I've been very much like Pro Bitcoin dominance because I just keep thinking like you know until we get back to looser monetary policy the alt coins are going to bleed back to the King right that doesn't mean every single day or every single week or anything like that but the general idea is that they they bleed back to the king and so you know the there are some of course pretty important levels that we could look at with a few of these different cryptocurrencies obviously we could start with eat Bitcoin you know if it should be no um no surprise of of what sort of that level to look for is and it's essentially 0.49 so a weekly close below 0049 should roughly correspond to 56% Bitcoin dominance now remember while I do think that e Bitcoin will break down it's important to remember that last cycle altcoins broke down before bit before ethereum dead before E dead so and I said previously right I said back over here in January that if it if it can't bounce or if it can't close that week below it and we bounce then it's likely going to take you know at least until March to get back down to the range lows well here we are it is March 18th yeah I don't know if you're watching this on March 19th whatever but we're getting back down to the range lows now that doesn't mean that it has to break immediately I mean it could hang out here for a while you know there's still a good chance that altcoins break down before eth does and so it's important to remember that right last cycle when eth Bitcoin broke down it actually broke down two weeks after a Bitcoin parasited right you can see the eth Bitcoin broke down July 8th all Bitcoin pairs actually broke down June 24th the week of June 24th so it took ethereum a little bit longer why is that well while I do you know poke you know sort of have these Jabs at e the reality in my opinion is is still better than basically everything else out there besides Bitcoin um bitcoin's the best and I don't really think it's that close but after Bitcoin comes ethereum and so that's why I think ethereum could could break down after the collective altcoin market now listen I know I'm going to say that and some people are going to get really upset and tell me about why their altcoin is is better than ethereum but I look I whatever I mean the reality is that ethereum is number two so I think the market has spoken that doesn't mean that it'll stay number two forever I'm convinced that Bitcoin will stay number one I think ethereum will likely stay number two but I'm not as convinced about that as Bitcoin but I still think it's likely to stay number two but when I look at all Bitcoin pairs sort of that same level for them to break is a weekly close at 39 or below and right now they're at 045 and again last cycle they broke before eth Bitcoin did so you know that would be the sign is our all Bitcoin pair is breaking down and you know there's certainly a chance that they will I mean look at last cycle what happened we had a wick down to the range low we then got a bounce and then it slowly rolled over and that was all she wrote for the altcoin market for quite some time especially on their Bitcoin pairs so when it comes to all Bitcoin pairs if this thing rolls over especially into the having and this breaks if that breaks then you're are you know you're probably going to see your your One Shining Moment where Bitcoin dominance breaks the Range High just like we talked about a year ago right but back then it was breaking above 49% now it's breaking above durably 55% right so the target the the target to break out above is 6% higher right instead of 49 it's 55 and it's crazy that I mean you know this effectively took almost a year just to go from here to here but has I mean I I I would say that Bitcoin heavy has has helped preserve the satos evaluation of your portfolio over altcoin heavy now yeah like there are some altcoins that are up a lot but most of them have in fact bled to bitcoin and again like I you know if you're going to cherry pick alt people say that you know well you're just cherry-picking altcoins sort of my response is like well isn't wouldn't it be the other way around right if if Bitcoin dominance is in an uptrend for you know basically since SE September of 2022 and really since May of 2021 if you exclude Stables there been an uptrend since then isn't it the people that are saying that alts have outperformed wouldn't those be the ones that are cherry-picking if the general trend has been up so I mean I think the issue is that everyone wants their altcoins to pump against Bitcoin but a lot of them have not and some of them have please do not let me know about all the ones that have I know it but there are some altcoins that we talked about before that are starting to break down like Matic Bitcoin has finally put in a weekly close below its range low right and this is one I said previously that once it breaks down e Bitcoin will likely follow after well we finally got a weekly close by madic Bitcoin below 1722 sets and now it's now below 1500 CS that doesn't mean it can't bounce around here for a while but you guys get the idea right I mean it broke down eight a Bitcoin I said I mean at the very least it's likely going to come back to 8 to 900 stats I think it's going to go below that but and again A lot of people are going to point out this trend line but I'm not I'm not convinced that's holding I I I think it's more than likely going to to fall below that trend line and and I think it makes more more sense to sort of look at it like this right where you know it it's I mean look the reality ises a lot of these altcoins are oscillators at best over a long enough period of time and so that's why my bias for these altcoins is to go to the downside right if you think about it if you look at if you look at all Bitcoin pairs I mean again objectively objectively right this here if we were to go grab a price label 1.35 98 I think it was around one right I think it went to one okay so it's a lower high okay now here 0.25 0.19 that's a lower low so so I think it's like it's hard because like I know that everyone wants their altcoins to Rally against Bitcoin but like this is you have to wonder right and I mean I don't know how to I really don't know the best way to draw it I mean you could probably draw it a thousand different ways but you really do have to wonder are altcoins just bleeding against the king over a long enough period of time right so if you believe the fundamental idea that all that individual altcoins are oscillators at best against Bitcoin if you believe that then would it the collective altcoin Market also be a bleeder against bit against Bitcoin and is that not what is happening you have a high from this cycle to a lower high in this cycle and then you have a low in this cycle to a lower low in this cycle okay that's sort of the pessimistic way to view you know the pessimistic way to look at it the more optimistic way would be to look at it like this and say it's an oscillator and that you had say a deviation outside of the Range High and then a deviation outside of the range low and so that is why I I think that rather than calling for say like you know this to go to 0.15 which it could do I I'd prefer to just say well I think 25% is the target just like the high was basically parody with Bitcoin where the altcoin market cap was equivalent to bitcoin's market cap so I think it's going to break down right and again like you know if you think about like why why does he have this by right why do I keep going through this why do I say the same thing over and over and over again monetary policy has not changed right and again I mean if if the idea is that that the higher interest rates go and the longer the FED holds them there and the longer quantitative tightening continues if the idea is that high-risk assets continue to bleed lowrisk assets which has been going on for a long time nothing's changed right I mean nothing's changed in terms of monetary policy if anything things have just gotten you know I mean interest rates have just stayed higher for longer so why should I pivot my view when monetary policy hasn't changed maybe the only that has changed is Bitcoin put in a new high and there are some examples previously where when Bitcoin puts in new highs alts can rally but remember a lot of times even when Bitcoin puts in new highs alts can still bleed all Bitcoin pairs didn't bottom last cycle until December of the having year and before that it was November of the post having year Well we don't have enough data to really go back but was a parabolic rally by Bitcoin that calls them a bottom and they bottomed once QE returned we're still in quantitative tightening so why I mean why the hell should all Bitcoin pairs bottom here maybe they do maybe I'm wrong and wouldn't be the first thing but would be the first time I'm wrong about something that's for sure but it just seems to me like the inevitable outcome you know shortterm pump not withstanding by all Bitcoin pairs is that it it eventually Fades and goes to the range lows and you can see it happening with individual altcoins right now the hard part with alts is that and no matter what time there's always something pumping against Bitcoin right so like recently we've seen um you know we've seen like avac the avac Bitcoin pair doing well right and so people are saying well what about that right or salana I mean salana has done pretty well uh against Bitcoin as well so what about that the hard part about all this is that like at any given point there's always going to be some alts that are doing well think about what happened like late 2022 early 2021 or early 2023 madic Bitcoin was doing very well in fact I mean it it it rallied back up to the range highs right I mean it it rallied 2 176% but now it gave back all those gains and it's now putting in levels is at levels that it hasn't seen since April of 2021 April of 2021 is when Bitcoin dominance was collapsing so if you find all these individual alt coins going below their prior range lows then eventually it likely means that Bitcoin dominance breaks above its Range High and you get that one Shining Moment another example a Bitcoin broke the summer 2022 lows long ago now it's starting to break the the next lows right so I mean you can see that a lot of these alts I mean look at the overall trend here right look at this curve right I mean they're just slowly bleeding and that the reality is that yeah like every once in a while you get these crazy pumps by them but it's still slowly going down so yeah I mean like at any given point like so like madic Bitcoin did well back in mid 2022 early 2023 but it hasn't done really well since avac Bitcoin is doing well now but it wasn't really doing a whole lot back then I mean it went up a a little bit but not back up to the range highs like madic Bitcoin did so there's always something right I mean even link Bitcoin again I I you know link is a coin that I was I talked about a lot last cycle but I mean anytime it gets close it just gets rejected BMB Bitcoin I mean it was putting in new lows just a few months ago what is there to say about Litecoin Bitcoin I mean if there's an altcoin that knows how to bleed against Bitcoin it is Litecoin I mean look at this thing down 97.62% since 2013 xrp Bitcoin xrp Bitcoin this look it's dropped even more since I last made this video right now it's down 96% since 2017 it's about opportunity costs guys it's about opportunity cost right I mean back in you know back in 2017 right December 2017 xrp was like $3 right today it's 61 Cs and everyone just keeps on waiting for the big one right and I'm not saying it's never going to pump I mean you can see that when it gets down these range lows it it can get some moves back up but the reality is that xrp is well below you know it's like 20% of what the the USD valuation was in 2017 whereas Bitcoin is many multiples of where it was back then right it's like 3x where it was in late 2017 so it's all about opportunity cost and it's all about preserving the satos valuation of your portfolio so yes there's always some that are doing well and and I I think some people sort of hold on to those few to sort of say well the Bitcoin dominance trend is not what you think but it's just there's you know there's people are rotating from this altcoin to that altcoin there's always something pumping but you know what hasn't changed changed in the last couple of years Bitcoin dominance in terms of the trend it just keeps on going up so over here people were speculating on certain alt coins and then over here they were speculating on different ones and then over here they're speculating on even different ones but the reality is that throughout all of it Bitcoin dominance just kept going up and again if should until loose for monetary policy R again if you're not familiar with like the general business cycle I mean think about think about bankruptcies the longer this goes on for the more bankruptcies that will be look at United States bankruptcies right I mean they're they're really starting to move up here again in the grand scheme they're still pretty low but they are moving quickly the froest of things go out of business first right that's why FTX and and all these Celsius right they collapse first Luna the froest of stuff collapses first the stronger stuff survives longer but even then I mean things will continue to drop we we saw another EV company go bankrupt just what L last week Fisker I mean look at this thing just a slow bleed and then this is what happened right why these companies they just run out of cash right they can't they can't keep operating in a high interest rate environment forever when demand continues to fall and if they can't look out in the future and envision a world in the foreseeable future where there's a lot lower rates and demand's coming back then what do they do I they can't just operate losing money forever so they declare bankruptcy the same principle I think could be applied to alt coins yes some can do well for periods of time I'm not disputing that but only the strong will survive this right only the stronger ones will ultimately survive and that's why for me right you know during a a quantitative tightening a rate hiking cycle right for me I just like I don't really care about all this froth in the cryptoverse that's why I've said just Bitcoin heavy no that doesn't mean that Bitcoin can't go down I've said that many times part of the op part of the idea is that Bitcoin does occasionally go down it crushes altcoins but again you know some of them can still do well what I've said before is that a major risk-off signal for the altcoin market would be dominance breaking Above This level right that's what I've said many times in fact because you've noticed after a lot of these Bitcoin pullbacks what happens all coins they just keep on going up like look at total three I mean it it literally just put on a new high for this cycle a week ago right so where does that Trend potentially change I think that Trend that Trend potentially changes if and when dominance breaks Above This level the reason for that is because a couple of reasons why one is is that level a little above that level 56% corresponds to the 0.5 FIB retracement right 56% so to break if we can break above 55.3% and then we just quickly go to 56 that's the same level that last cycle when it broke through the point F5 FIB that's what sort of marked a a local top by Bitcoin USD right there when it went through the 0.55 and Bitcoin didn't go on to put in a new low or anything like that but it did cool off for a little while and you know I mean I know some people here are just sort of of the up only crowd but I mean at some point Bitcoin will cool off for a while and you know if that phase comes soon then what you would see is sort of like a a a an area where Bitcoin continues to just sort of suck that liquidity out of the altcoin market right so like imagine a future scenario where Bitcoin rallies back up I don't know if it'll be a higher high or a lower high but whatever it ends up being theoretically all Bitcoin pairs should break down now the reason why it's taken so long for all Bitcoin pairs to break down is because there's a lot of liquidity lhing back and forth remember all Bitcoin pairs broke down last cycle when when they began cutting rates but all Bitcoin pairs did not break down because they started to cut rates right it's that the FED started to cut rates because the consumer was starting to show weakness so I'm not saying that the FED cares about your altcoins right but if all Bitcoin pairs were to break down that might imply that the consumer is showing weakness in other areas of the economy making the FED pivot right making the FED go back to looser monetary policy and that phase I think is still ahead of us now there's been a lot of times where we've gotten close to Breaking below this level but we keep not breaking below it one of the one of the things maybe not is because rate Cuts keep getting pushed further and further out right I mean you know one time they seem like they're going to happen this month and then keep getting pushed further and further out so the economy continues chug it along people are like oh well maybe things aren't so bad and then all Bitcoin pairs get another bounce right but I think at some point they will break down and it'll likely correspond near to when the FED starts to cut rates right maybe all Bitcoin pairs break down and the FED Cuts rates shortly thereafter not because altcoins are breaking down but because it represents weakness in the consumer the the average retail uh person right it would Rec it would represent weakness in the consumer if all Bitcoin pairs cannot keep pace and for a while they've been keeping pace and you might say well why is this time so different well it's not really if you look at it here when it hit this low I mean all Bitcoin pairs took 41 weeks to break down from this low right here we're currently 38 weeks in guess what 41 weeks say the week mid April mid April a month from now right around the Bitcoin having right right around the Bitcoin having maybe it'll correspond to just before rate Cuts in May or June so I I mean I continue to be of the opinion that these the collective altcoin Market will in fact bleed to bitcoin and I don't think any rational person could look at this chart and say that all Bitcoin pairs collectively have been bullish I think that a rational person could go pick out some altcoins that have done well against Bitcoin maybe even more than some I mean maybe more than just say a few but when there's tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies the amount that have durably outperformed Bitcoin isn't really that much over the last two years so but it's easy there's always some to do um there's always some that do and again I mean you could look at at other things like um there's others Bitcoin which some people like to look at and again I mean it had a nice rally up up over here into April 2019 a few months before rate Cuts arrived but then it still fell so I I I'm still of the opinion that all Bitcoin pairs will bleed and and some of these things are are sort of in Confluence in terms of if we do get above 56% dominance or if we get to 56% there's some things of Confluence I think that are important to look at for instance gold is durably going above 2070 we said that would be a signal that's happened um all Bitcoin pairs still haven't broken down eth Bitcoin still hasn't broken down but that stuff can all happen um some other things to think about are um you know sort of the relative strength of Bitcoin here's a great example of the relative strength of Bitcoin do you guys remember in um sort of the the Fib retracement from here to so so you can see that Bitcoin rallied up into the 3618 3618 FIB retracement now it has gone all the way up to the 4.236 basically to the dollar right you see that chart right Bitcoin 3.61 eight in 2021 but in 2024 4.236 now look at total it's reversed 2021 it went to the 4.236 today 3618 Bitcoin is shown relative strength compared to the rest of the market right because total includes Bitcoin but hasn't retrace to the 4.236 like Bitcoin has so I mean again I I I think there's this rotation of capital going on from alls to bitcoin it's not entirely just that I mean I think there's just more money going into Bitcoin and altcoins can't keep up with it but do you see how like Bitcoin has been stronger I mean it's not that surprising I mean bitcoin's hit new highs not many other things have I mean ethereum hasn't hit new highs salana while it's done well hasn't hit new highs xrp not even close right Unis swap not even close Doge not even close right all log go right not even close madic long way to go link nope Litecoin dot yeah right ax still a long way to go to get to New highs I'm not saying the can'ts ever get there right I'm not saying that I'm I'm just saying that like Bitcoin heavy has helped preserve the SAT devaluation of your portfolio and if Bitcoin were to correct and all coins haven't hit new highs what does that mean I mean they just go back down a lot if bit I mean that's the thing like Bitcoin would have the luxury to correct and still be well above these lows whereas a lot of all coins who knows who really knows and again I mean what you know it can of course all altcoins can break down against Bitcoin on either Bitcoin rallies or Bitcoin dumps right we've seen that many many times and it's hard to know you know which one it'll be it could probably be a combination of both right like we've seen Bitcoin drop the last couple of weeks and we've seen altcoin start to show some weakness against Bitcoin right they're down from 48% down to 46% um if you get say a a pump into the having or after the having or sometime whether it forms a higher high for Bitcoin or a lower high I imagine all Bitcoin pairs would then break down and find themselves somewhere over here and that's the issue right if and when that happens if they break down then there's nowhere to hide right like going back to some of the ones that recently broke down right like madic Bitcoin you know it it spent all this time trying to hold this as support and then now it hasn't and it's broken down and now now you have to wonder right you know like what are all these people thinking that so vly defended this low for so long now it's below that level so what do they do right I mean look what happened to adaa bitcoin after after it finally broke these lows over here last cycle right I mean it it sort of finally broke these lows and then it just capitulated down so a lot I mean a lot of that I think could sort of repeat itself um given enough time I think a lot of people just don't like waiting for this stuff to play out but I mean even look at like Ada Bitcoin just a downtrend right just a downtrend so you know I I think the catalysts are certainly there um you know what would cause the FED to cut rates something's got to happen right I mean I don't know what it would be could be a scary unemployment rate print I mean you can kind of see everything playing out right I mean you know Bitcoin dominance is going up everyone's chasing this manic Mania stuff um at the same time the unemployment ratees going higher hit hit 3.9% again I've said before Market Market rallies until it has a reason not to do so markets generally go up until it has a reason not to do so and I've said the two main reasons that it wouldn't are unemployment rate unemployment rate going up hitting that 4% I've said 4% is the main target or the main level that I think the market would care or inflation re accelerates and inflation is not really re accelerating but the issue for the FED is that it's not really going down either and it's been at 3% for a long time so you could sort of think about like people are getting excited about all it's hoping that inflation subsides and the FED Cuts but what's happening is the wealth effect right people the feds not cutting altcoins continue to hold because the econom is still holding up therefore altcoins go up wealth effect is in place people spend more money the FED has to go higher for longer and we just keep on going on and on and on and on and then eventually the economy finally shows weakness because the FED has stayed too high for too long then all coins finally break down then the FED pivots we go back to looser monetary policy we see how much damage the FED has done and we go back to quantitative easing and and we we go through another phase where in a future bow run then maybe eth Bitcoin does be well right but the reality is I mean like you know anyone who's been bullish on on eth bitcoin since the merge has been wrong right I mean it's dropped a lot since then um so yeah I mean like you can see the unemployment rate slowly turning the corner right as as everyone chases the manic rally um my my sort of speculation all along has been like guys you know having exposure to invest I mean to to something is is a good idea and the way that you do that in crypto is just be Bitcoin heavy right and say well to hell with all this other stuff I don't know how long it's going to take for the economy to show weakness and the FED to Pivot and all that stuff but Bitcoin gives you exposure to the upside while minimizing your downside risk right I mean that's what I've said all along it doesn't mean that Bitcoin can't go down right I mean it probably will go down a lot at some point who knows when that will be if you were to look at at at days since Bitcoin had a 30% drop drop I mean look at this we're at day 496 this is what happens right you know you go up for so long and it feels like it'll never drop and then finally does and it catches people off guard so again you know that's likely going to happen where where Bitcoin does get a larger drop at this point this drop by Bitcoin is still fairly consistent with what we've previously seen and and we talked about this in one of the recent videos right I mean at this point right again I mean things could change but at this point this correction by Bitcoin is a 12% drop again we've seen plenty of 20 to 22% drops right I mean all of these prior drops were like 20 to 22% drops roughly so when thinking about where we currently are only 12% down 20% down puts you at 58k now 58k coincidentally is the 8we estimate about it's at 57.5 so that would be an area to watch that 8we moving average 22% is right around that 8we moving average right 57 and a half the bull market support band on the other hand is much further down at around 33% down now the issue with going 33% down is it's further further down than what we've been seeing throughout this throughout this cycle and again like the 2019 rally it had pretty short pull backs and then when it finally did get a larger pullback to the bulll market sportband and it was about a 30 something per drop that was it for a while right the FED pivoted we went back to looser monetary policy but the damage had been done and the economy was we you know was somewhat weak for a little while and riskier assets like crypto like altcoins really started to do poorly I mean Bitcoin held up okay it still dropped 50% before the pandemic but it held up a lot better than the altcoin market did the altcoin market got obliterated during that time the hard part is knowing exactly where that top occurs now the reality is that this cycle is not exactly like 2019 because we actually put in a new high right so I don't mean to say that it's exactly the same but there's this other there's this other reality and that is everyone keeps looking at the social risk whenever I do these videos and saying well you know look how low it is everyone's going to come back my only point is that 300% rties don't always bring retail back 2019 we had 300% rity and we didn't hit a new alltime high but we still had about over a 300% rally and it didn't bring retail back we had to wait another year and a half and Retail didn't come back until looser monetary policy arrived so what happens if the same thing occurs right what happens if you cool off you know after the having or even now and you know then we go back to lose for monetary policy and then you get another move later on and take 2025 or something um because again I mean like so far this 2023 2024 rally by Bitcoin the social risk looks like 2019 right there's no guarantee that retail returns right there's no guarantee that YouTube views go back up to these levels you can have spikes but even that spike is already starting to Trend back down 300% rallies by Bitcoin do not bring retail back what brings retail back is altcoin starting to durably outform bitcoin everyone talks about alt season right and look alt season is not 10 different cherry-picked altcoins outpouring Bitcoin alt season is where Bitcoin dominance is collapsing like this right where's alt season in here get the magnifying glass right that's not what all season looks like retail returns when this happens right that's not what we're seeing so again I'm not saying that it can't eventually go to that probably will eventually but my point is that you you can't just look at this stuff and assume that it has to go all the way back up to the highest risk band immediately right in 2019 we rated a0.3 to point4 risk band with social risk and we still cooled off for a while and rallied like a year and a half later so again it's just something to think about so with Bitcoin dominance my general view is that we break above the Range High over the next few months I don't know how long it's going to take I wish I did but I'm not going to you know blow smoke and tell you I know when it's going to happen I don't but I I think that a lot of signs are pointing to that is the inevitable outcome could we go back down first yeah it's possible but I I do think that that is the inevitable outcome is that it slowly builds up here to the highs then it eventually breaks out and again you can kind of see it I mean look at um you can sort of see this ascending triangle right looks like it wants to break out does it come back down first and then do it or does it just go straight up I I don't know but it does look like it wants to to to eventually break out so that's where we are right that's where we are with it and and you know there's a good chance that we'll have some more pullbacks by dominance and there's a you know a 100% chance that when we do people will use that as as a reason to dunk on on me but um you know when you when you take a step back and you look at this it it has just been one massive uptrend it's all have slowly bled Back To The King and I think that people will finally get the memo if and when this breakout occurs I I still think there's a lot of people that sort of didn't believe this one over here then a lot of people you know when when it broke out over here they didn't think it was going to they were calling for alt season a rejection off the Range High they were wrong right but because Bitcoin USD kept going up their altcoins were carried along for the ride at some point Bitcoin USD will get a pullback and then their altcoins they'll find out that the only reason their altcoins were going up was because Bitcoin was going up and if Bitcoin goes down the altcoin market goes down a lot so again I I don't know if you know exactly when that occurs what I've said before is that I think that occurs when Bitcoin dominance breaks above the range highs right when it gets to that 56% level I think that's when that occurs and as I've said before right 56% we haven't hit that right and and because we haven't hit it there still is that liquidity that Bitcoin can take from the altcoin market right so if and when another rally by Bitcoin occurs whether it's next week or next month or three months from now you know what you should look for what happens to dominance does it break out on does dominance break out as Bitcoin gets that move back up whenever it occurs or does it you know does Bitcoin dominance break out becauseit coin just keeps on dropping and that that lower high or higher high just doesn't happen anytime soon I don't know but I'm still watching this I think it's as I've said before I mean I think Bitcoin dominance is the key to unlocking the secrets of the crypto I I think that it's it's people are happy about their all it's because they're doing well on their USD pairs but a lot of them are not doing well in their Bitcoin Pairs and a lot the a lot of these are just in Macro downtrends for those who care to look and even eth Bitcoin even the even the king of the altcoin market is still bleeding back down to the range lows and we said March at the earliest for it to bleed back down to the range lows March at the earliest doesn't mean it has to break the L range lows in March but just to get back down into this level we said March at the earliest here we are right so that's where we are um if retail does not come back like they did in 2021 or 2017 then the implication is that Bitcoin dominance should break out because when social risk when social risk here sorry let me um get the um I'm trying to remember where it social risk here it is I mean you can see pretty clearly right a social risk even if it goes up if it if it comes back down right if it stays low dominance should go up right it has gone up a little bit recently social risk and you can see that dominance excluding tables has come down a little bit just like it did over here but eventually eventually uh dominance still broke out and social risk came back down so um that's where I think we are I think that social risk will eventually go back down and and dominance will continue to break out because the way that dominance goes down is that retail comes back in mass and I just I don't think that we can definitively say that that's going to happen just yet it could happen and if it does I'd like to think I'd be willing to Pivot my view but it hasn't happened yet um some retail has come back but even even the some retail that has come back I mean we're still in the. 3 to point4 wristband which is exactly where we were back in 2019 we made it to the. 3 to point4 wristban and that was also over a 300% rally where it's a little unclear is we hit new all-time highs so you can see that you know because we hit new all-time highs now the social risk has gone up even more than it was back over here right so there's a little bit of a difference but the overall trend I think Remains the Same right dominance is going up all Bitcoin pairs are bleeding and so on and so forth again guys if you if

providing a detailed technical analysis and predictions on the future performance of Bitcoin relative to altcoins. The speaker argues that Bitcoin dominance has been in a consistent uptrend, with altcoins generally bleeding against Bitcoin, especially during periods of high interest rates and quantitative tightening. He believes this trend is likely to continue until the Federal Reserve eases monetary policy, and that altcoins will continue to underperform Bitcoin.The speaker further elaborates that the reason for this is that weaker altcoins will struggle to survive in a high-interest rate environment, similar to how companies go bankrupt when they can't operate profitably. He believes that only the stronger altcoins will ultimately survive this period. The speaker predicts that if Bitcoin dominance breaks above the 56% level, which corresponds to the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement, it would mark a significant shift in the market, potentially leading to a broader altcoin selloff as Bitcoin sucks liquidity from the altcoin market.The speaker also discusses the relative strength of Bitcoin compared to the broader crypto market, noting that Bitcoin has shown stronger performance, reaching new highs while many altcoins have yet to do so. He argues that this rotation of capital from altcoins to Bitcoin has helped preserve the purchasing power of Bitcoin holders, as altcoins would be more vulnerable to a Bitcoin correction.Overall, the sentiment remains bearish on altcoins and bullish on Bitcoin dominance, with the speaker predicting that Bitcoin dominance will break out above its current range and continue to rise.",302,"[0.049682617, -0.014984131, -0.01020813, -0.008331299, 0.019760132, -0.0340271, 0.060791016, 0.0033569336, -0.0027675629, 0.052734375, 0.010047913, -0.0060157776, 0.016525269, -0.02507019,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be providing an update to the bull market support band if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom let's go and jump in So bitcoin's currently coming in at around $68,000 this is obviously off the prior highs of 73,000 8K or so I mean it depends on the exchange that you use but it has had a bit of a pullback here right from the highs Bitcoin is now down about 7 and a half% the low the furthest that's gone down so far was about a 12% drop now if you've been following this entire run you're obviously no stranger to 12% drops in fact we've had a number of 20% drops right 20 to 22% drops we've been following that for a while and one of the things that I've said many times is that if you start to see Corrections that exceed that 20 to 22% range or so right if you get something that comes in at 30% then there might be reason to think that the trend is over and the trend is starting to reverse now we haven't had that yet right I mean we haven't had it yet it's hard to know exactly when that will materialize but so far this has only been about a 12% drop so what would a 20% drop drop even look like right I mean if if we were to drop 20% from the recent High what would that look like that would put you around 58k right 22% would put you around 57k and what's funny is that you know the 8we moving average which is something we're actually below not that long ago I mean literally you know a little less than two months ago we were below the 8we SMA the 8we moving average now is at 57.9k right but it's it's crazy how like the market will certainly make you feel a certain way because if it only goes up you know for basically two months straight and then you get a correction at all it it it can feel you know it can I mean it can it can certainly bring out emotions in people but I mean it just goes to show you how quickly Bitcoin has run up in in relatively short period of time in fact the extension from the 20we moving average if you were to look at the short-term bubble risk even with this drop is still a of the prior extensions it reached back in March 2023 and in December of 2023 so again despite that pullback by Bitcoin it is still more extended from the 20we moving average than it was back in March 2023 and in December 2023 when it had Fairly aggressive moves so it just you know it helps to put things into you know perspective I guess um and the the the bullmark sport band you know right now ranges from around 47.7k up to around 49.4 so I mean that's the thing I mean at at this point if we were to go to the 20we SMA I mean that's a pretty far drop I mean that would be about a a 35% drop remember in 2019 once you had a larger drop to the bullar Mark we after such a large extension it was about in fact about a 35% drop to get back there but it took a long time we didn't just go straight there we bounced around for a long time before that actually happened um so again I mean you know and it's hard I mean it's impossible for me to know if this is the the local top for Bitcoin or not I mean it could be uh it could also go a little higher as well we still haven't seen dominance break to the upside we still haven't seen Blue Chip dominance break to the upside but there are a few concerning things out there uh like there always are it's not like there's always something concerning out there but you know they they always do exist and we've talked about a lot of them for instance gold continues his breakout it has had a little bit of a pullback uh from the most recent Highs but again it's well above the prior range highs uh 2070 it's now at 2146 and so that has been something that we said you know half a year to 12 months ago we said look when when gold starts getting weekly closes below 270 that's a sort of a signal but we still haven't seen dominance of Bitcoin give that same signal just yet but you can see that some of the other things that you'd be looking for for dominance to really make that breakout are slowly happening like eth Bitcoin is starting to struggle again and the lower that it goes right that it should act as a Tailwind for for dominance to to ultimately go higher now some altcoins have been doing well while most do continue to bleed back to bitcoin um so again going back over to bitcoin USD one of the other things that you know we talked a lot about over the last I don't know what two three months was usdt dominance and I'm not married to this trend line by any stretch of the imagination a lot of times in fact these sort of these diagonal trend lines will will eventually be broken uh so it's not like we can take this one to the bank but historically when when this trend line was was tagged in the past it was just before a fairly large Direction in the cryptoverse okay could this time be different maybe but we did a video on this metric at around 6 and a half% usdc dominance and I said back then that if it gets rejected here and we see Bitcoin rally into the having and USD dominance usdt dominance dropped to about 4% or might maybe slightly less which it has then it would put us back at this trend line so that's exactly what's happened right I mean we see we've seen Bitcoin Rally from the spot ETF launch as we've gotten closer to the having and stable coin dominance right usct dominance has dropped back down to this trend line that has previously been respected so again I'm not saying that it has to Mark you know the the the sort of that turnaround point but you could see a case for it when we were over here when we first taged the trend line you know in February 2021 Bitcoin did go marginally higher in March and April right right even though USD dominance was putting in higher lows we have to think about well you know how could that happen one way it could theoretically happen is you said it right alts bleeding back to bitcoin you know I mean we've we're we're in that same area where all Bitcoin pairs are um you know they they've seen this bounce off of the range lows and I just wonder if they're just sort of going to roll over sometime as we get closer to the having and then go back down right so it could be that rotation from alts into Bitcoin uh that that you know lasts for a while um and so yeah I mean I've seen some people say things like well you know back over here when Bitcoin was making that move you know it it was going back to all the altcoins but what's interesting is that you know during that move they were right right I mean it was right I mean look at look at what Bitcoin Dominus was doing during that time and Bitcoin dominance was falling off a rock you're not seeing that here now yes there are some altcoins that are doing well but some altcoins do not represent the collective altcoin Market because if they did then dominance would have gone down but they haven't and dominance continues to sort of slowly very slowly grind higher here in contrast to what was going on over here where dominance was collapsing so while it is true that back over here Bitcoin was bleeding to altcoins back over here in 2019 at these highs altcoins were bleeding back to bitcoin collectively in 2017 Bitcoin was bleeding to alts right so again you had you have very different outcomes right in this case over here you had a rotation from Bitcoin to alts but over here you had a rotation of alts to bitcoin right very different this was Bitcoin to alts in early 2021 so you can see that it's not I mean again and it's a fair comment right I mean I read the comment I was slightly annoyed but then I was like well look I mean if if you join crypto in 2021 that's all you know right I mean that's all you've seen happen when Bitcoin gets into these sort of these ranges up at relatively high levels what happens what has historically happened right in 20121 right you saw Bitcoin bleed to the altcoin market and and ALT season commence after Bitcoin made these highs the Counterpoint of course is that that happened during loose monetary policy during QE low interest rates you know I mean the Fed was reducing their balance sheet right QE this was during High rates and the Fed was was was you know removing assets from their balance sheet and and during that that time we saw alts bleed to bitcoin right so if you're if you're sitting there looking at at say like a basket of 10 different alts and you're wondering why maybe only some of them are going up and not all and and while a lot of alts are still bleeding back to bitcoin I think the arguments is well what if what if that's sort of that phase where that's just what's happening I think one thing that often happens is like you know people will see Bitcoin pump for a while and they just go chase alts instead because they think alts will catch up and some alts do right some alts have had pretty good rallies right they have I'm not going to say they haven't they have but a lot of times the alts that are rallying are the ones that continue to rally and the alss that are not rallying continue to just do nothing and then the people that are trying to catch up to what Bitcoin did they end up buying these altcoins that haven't moved in a year and then those altcoins just keep on bleeding back to bitcoin so it's a dangerous game for for sure so again you know whether whether this turns into 2019 or 2021 I think it's going to be dependent on if retail comes back and of course we tracked that with a social risk on the website again you guys can check out ITC premium at intothe crypto.com sale is still going on but that's the ultimately question right like will retail return in any significant way or will it just sort of fade away you know like like 2019 so when thinking about where Bitcoin is right now um it it has had a little bit of a pullback here but again I mean considering the prior pullbacks it still is a relatively tame one you know I mean it's not even it hasn't even been 15% I mean 15% would put you at 62k now there are some important events coming up obviously uh fed related right fomc related if you go look at what's going to be happening on March 20th we have another fomc meeting so I imagine there will be some volatility around that but if Bitcoin does continue to fade here into the meeting or even after the meeting that 20% threshold is the level to watch right 20 to 22% because that is where Bitcoin has previously had Fairly large bounces and it also corresponds to the 8we moving average where it is now right who knows where it'll be in a few weeks but you know it Loosely corresponds to where 8we moving average is right now um and if on the other other hand Bitcoin just pushes higher I mean there's examples of that too uh look at 2021 right it had a long Wick up right there and then even after getting that long Wick up with a small candle body closed what happened the following week it had a larger Wick to the downside but it still closed green and then it just continued to slightly grind up so I've said before I mean I do think there will be some rotation from alt into Bitcoin the closer we get to the having and I know that I know like right now all Bitcoin pairs are you know they have been going up here for a little bit but I still liken it to what we saw potentially right here before it it inevitably came back down and it's hard to know I mean like you know I think you could have made a case at any point over here that that was where it was right and it was about to sort of fade and it and it just keeps not doing it but I think the reason it keeps getting back down to the range lows and and it seems like it's going to fade and then it doesn't is because these expectations for rate Cuts keep getting pushed further and further out right so I think the economy has remain stronger for a lot longer than a lot of people thought these rate Cuts get keep getting pushed further out if you're wondering what that has to do with a Bitcoin pairs just remember when you look at at interest rates and you you overlay them with all Bitcoin pairs you can see that it wasn't until the FED started to cut rates right here in July or you know that's basically when all Bitcoin pairs finally bottomed just about a month or two after the First Rate cut so that's why the bias that's why my bias continues to be that all Bitcoin pairs will eventually break down it's just hard to know exactly when that is I think the market keeps sort of thinking all right well it's now no it's now no it's now and then what happens we get some hot inflation data labor market still prints below 4% unemployment and and then we just kick the can down the road right Bitcoin gets this another rally then some of the stronger alts sort of follow it a lot of the weaker alts just keep on bleeding on their Bitcoin pairs there's enough alts for people to to sort of not believe the Bitcoin dominance Theory U despite the fact that that dominance you know largely has been an uptrend uh for the better part of a year and a half now when you include stable coins so a lot of interesting things going on in the market right now the other thing that I thought was interesting was uh the FIB retracement stuff so look at this you guys remember how in um in 2021 Bitcoin you know it basically when it when you look at the FIB retracement toal right from the 2018 Peak 2017 Peak you can see the Bitcoin really retrace to the 3.68 now in this most recent rally right in this most recent rally you can see that actually retraced almost per perfectly to the 4.236 right what's fascinating about that to me is the fact that Bitcoin has retraced to the 4.236 but total has not but what's more interesting is that total retraced to the 4.236 back in 2021 so what does that say what does it really say what to me what it says is that you basically had a massive rotation from altcoins to bitcoin because look look closely in 2021 total retrace to the 4.236 right now it's at the 3618 which is where the first top was in May of 2021 but look at Bitcoin USD again and where it is retraced to it is now retraced to the 4.236 but over here it more or less topped out at the 3618 so it sort of seems like they've reversed right total hit the 4.236 back in 2021 whereas Bitcoin did not and now we've seen it reverse now bitcoin's at the 4.236 and total market cap is not so if there were a larger retrace here then I imagine that that Bitcoin would you know I mean I I I have to imagine that it would it would not be great for the altcoin market now again what do you look for right if it you know what would you look for for it to turn into something larger um again you know anything below 22% or so right if it because if it if it drops back down you know to the bu Mark SP pan which by the way is below 50k right if it drops back down there then you really have to start to wonder all right well because it got so far extended if it has to get say like a 30% drop does that mean it's now finally playing out like you know like 2019 did just before rate Cuts arrived so I think that is the important thing to sort of look out for as you get closer and closer to the having and it actually could be the having that keeps Bitcoin elevated relative to the altcoin market right I mean in 19 that's essentially what happened right it it kept Bitcoin elevated relative to the altcoin market um and if you know if this is correction is just sort of a just sort of a onewe thing and it doesn't fade then um then you just you know you kick the can down the road and you say all right well I mean we'll we'll revisit the 8we estimate eventually or the bull marks we in and you know we we'll see what happens uh to it whenever it tries to hold but the problem with with it is I've said this before right the longer you go without testing the harder it is to hold it at support now we're at 22 weeks you know I mean we talked about it when it was like 15 weeks and 16 weeks all right well if it were to test him now it might hold it as support but the further you get out the harder and harder it's going to be and you know given how high it is above it unless you get a massive drop in a single week right I mean it could take several weeks just to get back down there especially considering the you know what if it's not until May so again we'll continue to follow the 20 week SM 21 EMA um hopefully these videos are useful to you guys um and again if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the Crypt verse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom we have all sorts of we all all sorts of charts on the website over here um not only for Bitcoin but also for a lot of altcoins as well so make sure you guys check that out luck and lower rate I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-03-17 00:00:00,"The video provides a detailed technical analysis of the current state of the Bitcoin market, focusing on the bull market support band, the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance, and the potential impact of upcoming events like the FOMC meeting. The speaker notes that while Bitcoin has experienced a pullback from its recent highs, the correction has been relatively tame compared to previous drops, and the market remains in a bullish trend. However, the speaker cautions that a drop below the 20% threshold could signal a more significant reversal, potentially mirroring the 2019 market dynamics. The overall sentiment is cautiously bullish, with the speaker highlighting the importance of monitoring key technical indicators and the potential for rotation between Bitcoin and altcoins as the market approaches the next halving event.The main message and conclusion of the video is that the Bitcoin market remains in a bullish trend, but investors should be vigilant for signs of a more substantial correction, as the market's behavior could shift depending on the outcome of upcoming events and the continued evolution of macroeconomic factors.",208,"[-0.0059547424, 0.020828247,

hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the macroverse today we're going to talk about inflation or the more recent CPI report we will also discuss the effects of that on risk assets such as crypto if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom link is in the description below let's go ahead and jump in so we did just get the most recent CPI report and you can see that headline inflation is still hovering just above 3% and this is something that we speculated was going to be an issue for the FED because it is much easier to go from say 9 to 8 or 8 to 7 than it is to go from 3 to 2 in fact it was in the 1970s when we saw inflation dropped down to about 3% and the fed pivoted too quickly and then we saw a second wave of inflation and in fact it was during that second wave of inflation where once it started to get going you can see that the S&P 500 hit another Market top which ended up being a slightly higher high compared to the top from November of 1968 and so the FED has to essentially thread the needle between how do you how do you bring inflation back down to 2% without leading to a Slowdown in the economy if they pivot too soon then rather than get a Slowdown in the economy it could lead to the reacceleration of inflation just like we got in the 1970s however if they were to stay too high for too long you could get a period of deflation where you see the inflation uh the inflation rate I you can see here we went into deflation back in 1940s also coming out of period of high inflation um after World War II and we went into negative -3% so when people talk about you know will the will a Fed achieve a soft Landing you can see how how difficult it is it's not impossible but it's difficult because the FED has to essentially pivot soon enough to avoid a deflationary crash like the like the 1940s but they need to wait long enough so that we don't get another wave of inflation like we saw in the 1970s so again that's why when we talk about the idea of a soft Landing or a hard Landing this is why you know this is what makes it difficult is is the Fed really has to know the appropriate time to Pivot and that the reason why that's hard is because monetary policy operates with long and variable lags so for instance right now inflation is hovering at around 3% now it's possible that if the FED just holds at 55% for another few months it's possible that inflation will just start to come back down it's also possible that even if the FED were to start cutting tomorrow that inflation would still come back down because even if if even if they were to cut 25 basis points or 50 BAS points if it's still sufficiently above the neutral rate our star then it might not be enough to to lead to the reacceleration of inflation so again it's very difficult to know where that threshold is and and that's sort of the dynamic that we continue to sort of have to watch so again headline inflation is still right around 3% and and staying the course long enough in order to see it go back to 2% is is the most difficult task and I mean Powell has said that it's not that they have to it's not that they have to see inflation at 2% but they need to see a durable path to getting to 2% and I know they don't focus on Headline inflation but if you just simply were to look at headline inflation there's no clear and obvious evidence just yet that it's on a durable path to 2% right I mean it's still at around 3% and again we can see a period over here in the 70s where we stayed at 3% you know for the better part of we say like let's say from I guess all the way from October of 71 until February of 73 right I mean over a year and it still didn't go to 2% and you can see what ended up coming after it so that is where we currently are can the FED stay high enough for long enough and that's what we're going to find out so if we were to break this down because I I I want to talk about sort of My Views and why as long as the FED continues doing what they say they're going to do why I do think it will slowly come down if we break this down by category okay so let's look at inflation year over year per category so this is headline but take a look at some of these categories and you'll find that most of them are already below 2% food and beverages has now reached 2 25% and you can see over a long periods of time I mean where it is now is essentially where it it is in in Fairly good times it's just that the FED still hasn't reversed course yet and so until they do this metric may continue to drop if you were to look at a monthly change you know I was looking at this it sort of looked like it it might be leveling out here a little bit but then this drop is a bit more sub is a little bit more substantial than the previous one and if you you were to look at a monthly change right you can see that the pace at which it was dropping was going down right it was sort of leveling out but this last month it dropped a good bit I mean especially compared to the month before almost twice as much as it did from the month before so that is how you go into a period of of deflation If the Fed doesn't pivot soon enough and and these things just sort of slowly continue to drop um that could be an issue right now that could be just sort of a oneoff thing I don't want to imply that this single data point means much of anything taking a 3-month moving average would show that it's still slowing down so I don't want to read too much into a single data point but I mean you can see how this metric could theoretically become deflationary and in fact it has gone deflationary in 2009 and and even in in 2016 we had a recession scare back then we we avoided it but you can see that it did go deflationary in both of those prior examples now some of these metrics have already gone deflationary and we'll get to some of those but housing housing is makes up a large component of headline CPI and it's a lagging indicator and it is continuing to drop right it it dropped from 4.66 to 4.55% but because it's a lagging indicator it takes a lot longer for that data to really show up to be reflected what's really going on in the economy and and therefore it might make the FED stay higher for longer than they really need to stay long high on on rates just because even if they were to Pivot there's a decent chance that housing would continue to drop just because of the long lags associated with it but this one is still well above the 2% Target now when it drops I mean it it can drop pretty quickly um so that is something to keep an eye on but at this point the the pace at which it's dropping hasn't even really been accelerated in now apparel is one that is is essentially deflationary now right remember when we talked about food and beverage we we talked about well if it continues its path it's not going to take long for it to go deflationary you can see that a Peril already is right now app Peril is one of those things that can often be deflationary so I don't really think we should read too much into it but you can see how we went all the way up here from around six 6 to 7% and now it has gone deflationary Transportation went deflationary back in 2023 but ever since then it's been slightly positive currently it's back to around 2.75% so this is actually going in the wrong direction for the FED but transportation is one of those things that it does t to be a bit more of a volatile Series so I don't really think it's as important to follow Medical Care went deflationary as well and then recently it's been starting to go back up some of this could be due to the base effects but um February 2024 medic Medical Care inflation is now at  1.41% Recreation this is one that actually saw a fairly sizable drop um in this most recent print because we were at 2.77 and then we dropped to 2.09 so that's a welcome change for this series to see it actually drop down to 2% that's just another another one another one of the metrics that has now dropped to 2% right so if they all dropped to 2% that'd be nice but again only some of them have education and communication uh had gone deflationary but now it's back up to3 89% and then other goods and services this is one we've been following for a while uh as as sort of one of the problem uh cases for inflation because it has been hovering you know 5 to 6% for so long we just had a pretty big drop from 5.7 down to 4.74 in 1 month looking at a monthly change that's the largest drop we've had in the category right since this whole thing began so the FED is making progress right they are making progress but again when this one drops as history shows it it can drop really quickly when it does actually start dropping so another one to keep an eye on now it's important to remember that all of these different categories are not weighted the same when it comes to calculating what headline CPI even is in fact if you were to look at the inflation year-over-year contributions to it and we were to isolate each and every one of them and and put it up next to headline inflation what you'll see is that food and beverage makes up a really small component it's only3 of the 3.17 right you can see the the tiny component it it has of this of the overall headline inflation the one that has the most impact by far is housing you can see that I mean it it essentially accounts for 2/3 of it at this point and so that's why I go back to this idea of you know a lot of the the headline inflation the the reality of it being at 3% is mainly because housing inflation has not yet come down but I'm still putting forth the idea that it is a lagging indicator housing is a lagging indicator and that should continue to drop over you know over the next 6 to 12 months so that's why I do think it's more likely that inflation will go down then durably back up um and what we're seeing is just sort of the last mile of of 3% 3% 3% all these prints basically forcing the FED to keep on on staying at 5 1 half% for their fed funds rate do they pivot soon enough apparel you know I mean basically is is is is taking away from Headline inflation at this point uh transportation makes up a relatively small amount but somewhat noticeable 4 61% uh Medical Care relatively small amount almost negligible in there Recreation the component relative be negligible amount 0.1 of the three uh education and communication pretty negligible in the calculation there and then other goods and service is is pretty low right 0.12 of the 3.17 so again you know housing and um and transportation those are the two categories that when you add them up count for about 2.5 of the 3.17 that we're looking at here right those two categories so and we just showed right we just showed how Transportation already went deflationary it's starting to go back up but we could easily see that one sort of reverse course again I mean again if you were to look if you go back and look at it per category and isolate transportation and we sort of zoom in over here uh you can see that it actually went deflationary in March and we just got the data point for February so what if as we get into sort of the march to June July time frame it's possible that it just goes deflationary again and if housing then comes down then you have this sort of dilemma of like well now every it's not a dilemma right it's it's what the FED wants then you have everything going down and and have they waited too long to Pivot that's sort of the question that I think we should ask and I think a lot of people sort of look at this stuff and and think that it doesn't really matter um but I I I I would push back on all that because I I do think the economy matters I do think the business cycle matters I just think it takes place over many many years and it's easy to sort of not care about it but that's at least you know what people are mostly concerned about in the macroverse right now is is you know what's going on with inflation and and is the Fed going to stay too high for too long and if you were to look at core inflation you know it it has continued to drop but the problem is that it's not really dropping quickly enough right for % 4% 3.9 3.87 3.76 I mean it's it's on the right path don't get me wrong but it's not dropping that quickly not compared to what it was dropping back in the summer of 2023 so you know if you can look where we we just got the data point for February this is where we were last February so we can see that what happened last time is core CPI again it kind of sted out a little bit up until the next reading and then following that as we went into the summer we really started to we really started to see it fall again so that is is is something else is is to look at core inflation and recognize that it is dropping but I don't know if it if it's obviously on a path to 2% just yet and because of that the fed's probably not going to Pivot at their March meeting and if you were to go look at at interest rates and and at least what the what sort of the probabilities are for the FED funds rate you can see that the the FED is likely not going to Pivot in March only a 1% chance of a rate cut even in May they're saying only about an 8.9% chance of a rate cut these probabilities are subject to change and I wouldn't be surprised to see them change right I mean if if the unemployment rate in April comes in at at 4% or something I would expect that the probability of a rate cut in in May to go up a lot but if that doesn't happen then we might not get Cuts until later in the year and the funny part about this is that in June the the probability while the probability is still in favor of a rate cut only you know there's a 4 almost a little over a 45% chance that they keep rates at 5 a half% even in June right even in June so all important things to consider here because you know this this stuff when when we do get rate Cuts we know that that does tend to have effect on the markets last cycle for Bitcoin we saw Bitcoin find a local top just before the FED started to cut rates I'm sure many of you guys remember that uh in fact if we were to Overlay this on the chart you will remember that and this is why we talk about monetary policy right it was it was right there that the FED cut rates in July and and Bitcoin sort of topped out just before that and and what's interesting with Bitcoin is that you can almost see the exact same pattern after the FED cut rates right and if you look at a bar pattern or sorry after the FED pause right if you look at a bar pattern right here up until that Peak so if we just sort of match this up what do you notice this is when the FED paused right here this is when the FED paused right there in both cases where the FED paused Bitcoin initially sold off and then it rallied until just before the FED cut rates right here right after the FED paused Bitcoin sold off and then you know has this been just sort of a rally until the FED Cuts rates and if you if overlay right this that right there I mean you can see it I mean it's not identical right it's not identical but it does go to show how similar the markets are from one cycle to another right the FED pauses the market sells off and then the market rallies until the until just before rate cuts and that's exactly what we've seen over here right rally until you know probably sometime before rate Cuts now that doesn't mean that you know that that doesn't necessarily mean you rally until May uh you could but the reason it doesn't mean that is because this is not going to be predictive right Bitcoin doesn't find a local top because the fed's going to cut rates the FED Cuts rates because the consumer throws in the towel which will be reflected in something like Bitcoin finding a local top does that make sense like that's how I think about it I could be wrong but that's how I think about it I mean I I think I think that that Bitcoin really represents the best of the cryptoverse and it really represents the consumer you know and as long as as long as it's going up you know the consumer is still holding but if it finds some type of local top then it would imply that maybe the consumer has reached a breaking point where they can no longer you know they can no longer do this and and and keep Bitcoin floating higher then it finds a local top sells off and you might say well the fed's not going to Pivot because of Bitcoin you're right they're not but if something like that were to happen it it might imply that that the consumer the retail consumer is starting to show a little bit of weakness so I I don't think you can look at this to say oh well Bitcoin has to Rally until one month before this is saying the First Rate cut arrives no this stuff can all get repriced right these these rate Cuts could get pushed further out if if inflation data continues to come in at at 3% and doesn't budge right it could get pushed further out out or if inflation data falls off a cliff or the unemployment rate falls off a cliff in in April then uh this stuff can can get pulled forward right rate Cuts can get pulled forward in 2019 we only had three rate cuts that was the last you know the last cutting cycle when the last cutting cycle began and back then the First Rate cut arrived in July so you know this is is is something to to focus on to watch and and how does it affect fect crypto right how does it affect crypto well not only does it affect Bitcoin USD but as I've said before the the higher we go I mean sorry the longer the FED keeps rates high at 55% then the longer it will take the the longer period of of of Bitcoin dominance going higher and higher and higher it's the same way the Magnificent 7 right uh you know the Magnificent 7 have have sort of lifted tech stocks for long time but some of those are starting to fall off right I mean some of those tech stocks it's sort of like the Fantastic Four at this point for crypto you can make the same kind of case that Bitcoin will hold stronger longer than the rest and therefore dominance goes up for that entire time and remember last cycle it was it was in fact when the FED started to cut rates it was just after that that dominance finally topped out so that's how it affects crypto in my opinion right if the FED stays higher for longer which they're probably going to do with inflation still at 3% it means that people leave um riskier stuff in favor for the stuff that's more likely to survive you know higher mon or stricter and Tighter monetary policy and so they defer to the Blue Chips of the respective asset classes so that's how I think it would affect crypto basically Bitcoin continues to reclaim more and more market share until sometime after the fed the Federal Reserve pivots to looser monetary policy but I don't think you're going to be pivoting in March simply because inflation data continues to show it's staying at 3% and even the market is I normally at this point the market is pretty accurate like when when you're only about a about 5 days away from the meeting um and it's 99% off like normally the market is right at this point right you know if it's a month or two out obviously that can change but something catastrophic would have to happen between now and next week for you know for for the FED to to to Pivot right and so they're probably not going to Pivot and and maybe what you see happen is the market kind of get kind of boring until after that meeting and then we figure out you know what the feds resolve is what they're going to do that can sometimes happen right and and even even March for Bitcoin right we've we've seen previously where where March can can see some type of of um um week you know week period I mean even even last um um last last year right in early March we had sort of a selloff and even over here right in in 2021 right if you look at at at March there was a bit of a selloff right there um right here there's a bit of a selloff right so I mean this does tend to be a repeating pattern but uh not that out of the ordinary so we'll see what Bitcoin does as we get into um you know as we get into uh next week where the fed and the Federal Reserve has the fomc and we see are they going to keep staying higher for longer my guess is they do and my guess is because of inflation staying sticky at 3% they will likely just sort of reiterate that they're going to keep interest rates higher until they see a durable path to 2% they might you know give him you know give some they might provide some insight on to win the first RIT first cut might be um but I've often said that it's almost the the the the pricing out of rate Cuts could eventually force them to get price back in um and you can see that I mean a lot of these a lot of rate Cuts have already been priced out once upon a time the market thought the FED funds rate was going to be at 4% by December 2024 now the market thinks it'll be at 4.75% by December 2024 so that has changed by 75 basis points just over the last couple of months alone so again the pricing out of all these rate cuts that were supposed to come uh could eventually lead to them being priced back again but you know that that process is still an ongoing process if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale

assets like cryptocurrencies. It analyzes the challenges the Federal Reserve faces in achieving a soft landing by bringing down inflation to 2% without causing a recession. The analysis suggests that while some inflation metrics have already dropped below 2%, housing inflation remains elevated, which could force the Fed to keep interest rates higher for longer. The transcript also explores how this could affect the crypto market, with Bitcoin potentially outperforming altcoins as investors seek safer havens during a period of tighter monetary policy. The overall sentiment is cautiously bearish, as the transcript suggests the Fed may need to maintain a hawkish stance, which could negatively impact the crypto market in the short term.Summary: The transcript provides a detailed technical analysis of the current inflation landscape and its potential implications for the crypto market, suggesting a cautiously bearish outlook as the Federal Reserve navigates the delicate task of reducing inflation without triggering a recession.",192,"[0.047790527, 0.020584106, 0.047729492, 0.025299072, 0.010002136, 0.007171631, 0.045806885,

hey everyone and thanks for jumpping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be providing an update to the bull market support band if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom let's go a and jump in so Bitcoin did hit 70k this past week we actually did a live stream where we caught it live so that was pretty exciting uh but right now Bitcoin is at 68.5k we basically being between 68 and 70k uh for essentially the entire weekend and and to give of an update where the 20we SME is it's currently at 46.1k and the 21 we EMA is around 47.6k now the reason why we track this if you're new is because generally speaking you will expect it to occasionally check in with the 20we ese or the 21 we EMA um they're in plenty of Cycles right where we just sort of regularly check in with it and so long as you hold it as support it gives sort of the all clear to continue higher but there are times where you don't really check in with it um and and it sort of the the path ends up being a bit different but in 2017 you know as long as you checked in with it every 3 to four months or so it generally meant that you would go to a higher high right and I mean every 3 to four months sort of checking in with it and then we got to the point where we didn't really get back back down to it until about 20 weeks later or so and then Bitcoin so you know showed a lot of struggle trying to hold it as support and ultimately was unable to hold it as support in 2019 we never really held it as support we just got above it and then when we finally got back down to it we were unable to hold it as support and that was also around that 20we Mark 24 weeks or so and then in 2021 right we held it as support leading to another leg up and we actually did a lot of videos during this time saying look if we hold it out support it's likely going to lead to some type of parabolic rally by bitco coin but what ended up happening is we did get a parabolic rally but we did not test the 20we SMA during this time and when we finally did test it you know over 30 weeks later whether you want to measure it from like right there or or further back but let's just say 32 weeks later we were unable to hold it as support so again the whole idea is that you know when you get to the point where it's been 20 to 30 weeks without testing it Bitcoin has shown an inability to hold it as support now could this time be different maybe but if you look at how long it has been it has now been about 20 weeks or so right now in the short term right in the short term that doesn't really have any implications um on on bitcoin um I mean you know even in in this real over here after we got above or after we sort of left that 20we SME you know right like 21 weeks later Bitcoin was at this level and it's still continue to push up for a couple more months before getting a larger pullback into the 20we SMA right so it's not it's not necessarily a suggestion that anything has to play out in the short term in 2019 you can see that Bitcoin rallied until about week 12 but then it it Consolidated for a lot as it as the dominance of Bitcoin went up and all Bitcoin pairs bled right so like all Bitcoin pairs bled leading to bitcoin USD stting propped up for much longer than all USD Pairs and eventually got back to 20we SMA and fell below it so you know right now you know if if Bitcoin were to go back down and retest it um I mean it would require a 30% drop and you know the thing about that is in 2019 whenever you had QT and high rates just like today we only got relatively shallow drops um and then once you ended up getting a larger Drop Like 30% or so to the 20we to the 20we SM 21 K it ended up signaling a reversal in the trend so it's one of those things where like in the same way like this cycle we've only had relatively shallow pullbacks of 20 to 22% or so constantly making people want more um and that was why back over here I was very clear that look guys this could be sort of that preh having dip the typical preh having dip that comes and you might not get anything more than that assuming that it plays out like all these prior three Corrections by Bitcoin and that was at 39K and now we've gone all the way up to 70k right so Bitcoin essentially added $30,000 or more to its price in only about a month and a half I mean it just goes show you how quickly the market can move and I I also think that market participants can get used to new prices really really quickly so while the bull Mark sport band is is pretty far down you know and it and it sounds like absurd prices like you know 46k and whatnot we were there not even that long ago I mean about a month ago Bitcoin was at that price it just feels so low because we've been accustomed to these higher prices for long it's like when you know when you're going up you can never it's hard for people to imagine ever going down when you're going down it's hard for people to imagine ever going up but the thing to keep an eye on is the fact that we have been now about 20 to 21 weeks or so since really testing that 20we Ese and it it really raises the question well you know whenever we do test it is the Integrity or is it is it going to be somewhat compromised just because it has been so long um it would have been more ideal for Bitcoin to actually test it as support here um rather you know so that so that you can kind of confirm move higher come back test it same thing that we saw previously right same thing that we saw in in 2017 when you get into these sort of these fomo rallies like 2019 a couple of times right you you'll see where you you sort of Fade Into the 20 week ese but you don't actually get all the way back to it and and then it just leads to these sort of these fomo rallies where everyone sort of piles in even as you get into a late business cycle type environment as as rates are high and and QT continues um and then eventually it it you know that sort of that liquidity fades in the altcoin market all Bitcoin pairs bleed Bitcoin down dominance goes up and then Bitcoin finally reaches a point where it goes back below 20 moving average so again I mean that that phase could still be some time away my my main sort of speculation as it as it has been is that you know these Bitcoin rallies are are not only fueled by spy ETFs and people that regular dcang but also the fact that altcoins are bleeding to bitcoin and that is something that we have continued to see for a long time so I would still keep an eye on that because that whenever all Bitcoin pairs do break down that might be a sign of a larger pullback by Bitcoin USD and if you do get a larger pullback let's say larger than 20 to 22% then it might imply some type of shorter term reversal in in the overall trend um I think the hard part with this sort of stuff you know just like 2019 just like 2020 and and late 2017 is that when you get into these sort of these manic modes it's impossible to know right how how high it's going to go before it actually does get that larger pullback and that's why we've looked at so many different indicators right we've looked at at USD dominance and gold breaking out and and where all Bitcoin pairs are and what they would need to get to in order to be collectively broken down and where e Bitcoin needs to get to right so if you see that all that Confluence coming in and you also get a larger correction by Bitcoin at some point um you know later this year then that could that could imply you know some type of of trend reversal in at least the medium term um but as always right it's it's a Fool's errand trying to predict exactly how high these rallies will go before those larger pullbacks happen and so I think it makes sense to have a plan um to navigate it really no matter what happens right React to what happens and have a plan based on that I think is what makes the most sense um rather than you know trying to constantly predict exactly where the top is going to be or the local top is going to be uh and we've looked at a number of different things right I mean we've looked at at say the short-term bubble risk and you know right now Bitcoin is about 50% above it's 20we moving average so it's certainly gone above it's certainly more extended than where it was back over here in March 2023 and also in December of 2023 right so it has been more expended extended and what you may notice is that from one sort of mania phase to another the extension from the 2 SMA is going down now we can look at that in a different way I've showed this many many times you can actually take the natural log of the price over the 20we moving average and sort of connect the dots and and see that you know I mean it's depending on how you want to connect the dots right you can see there's a little bit more wiggle room by bit USD to the upside uh if you connect to dots like that or if you're a little bit more conservative you can say that we've already reached that level right and you know sort of what I'm saying is again like it's impossible to predict the top or at least the local top but whenever there is a larger pullback in the market look towards that 20we SMA that 21 we EMA and the longer it takes us to get there the you know the harder it probably comes to actually hold it just because we didn't really build up support along the way right in 2020 we didn't not build support along the way 2019 we did not build support along the way right so whenever the bare Market finally came for it you know you had to go down slowly to test where you know where where was support actually same thing over here right you had to just slowly go down and keep testing it until you found where support was when in the rally there just was no there was no consolidation really to be found other than just a couple of weeks right and so from here we haven't really seen anything like that as well right it's just been slowly moving up uh or quickly moving up a little consolidation but no real test of the bullmark sport band and then ultimately um continuing higher right and so that is is is something that um you know I mean it continues to play out right and and who knows who knows exactly where it it it goes in the short term but the extension of the 20we SMA is at around 50% and and we'll continue to keep an eye on it in terms of you know if we do start to fade to it later this year my speculation as I've said I mean I you know the the main two things to think about are are what eth USD did going into the merge and what Bitcoin USD did going into the spot ETF right there was this rally into the spot ETF with the merge with E that rallied for about a until a month before the ET or before the merge it topped and then there was had a lower high into the merge so you know I don't know if it's going to play out with Bitcoin like a rally into the having or if it tops out about a month before the having and then we get a lower high in the having um something like that but regardless I I do expect some type of cool off phase um you know as we as we get Beyond these main narrative driven things right the the the having and of course the the spot ETF for eth and and then I think we're going to have to face the music in in some other areas but if there's not a cool down phase after the having then I you know you could have you certainly could have some type of of translated cycle top okay um I know a lot of people have talked about that and I again I don't really have a strong opinion on it I I I know from history that it's impossible to predict you know just how high the Mania phase will take you and and just how high the risk levels will go and so you know rather than than definitively say you know if you end up getting something like 2019 and you just sort of get a modest cool off period followed by a shift back to QE then maybe you end up going through a fairly typical cycle if on the other hand you know the risk levels go all the way up to the 0. N to1 rban like 2020 and 2021 the 2020 and 2021 rally then you might be you know you could be looking at at a sort of a translated the translated top but you know for now I continue to think it's not really either of these right I think it's a combination of the two because this occurred during QT and high rates but actually this one over here where we broke to new highs occurred during QE and low rates right so this of course occurred during QT and high rates but it also broke the high so I think what we're seeing right now is actually a combination of the QT bull market and then the QE bull market in terms of it's it's more like this one in terms of monetary policy and more like this one in terms of putting in new highs and and one thing to think about too is is when you look at at interest rates and you look at last cycle what you'll really notice is that when the FED paused right here right when the FED paused what ultimately happened in the short term was that the market sold off right so the market initially sold off and then it rallied for a while until rate Cuts arrived right and so right here after the Fed cused what same thing right the market sold off and then it's just been rallying for a while and now over here in 2019 once this rally you know once that low came in the market rallied for about 20 weeks or so and here once this low came in it's been about 26 weeks right really it rallied until about one month before the First Rate cut arrived and we also know that the First Rate cut arrived last cycle about 1 month after all Bitcoin pairs broke down and about 1 month after gold broke out now we just saw gold broke out we just saw gold gold break out haven't seen all Bitcoin pairs break down a lot of that stuff can happen relatively quickly so just something to think about right again it's kind of a combination of the two with putting in new highs um like we did you know like we did back over here but QT High rates like it was in in 2019 and I think you can pretty clearly see that because in the 2019 rally we know that that Bitcoin dominance went up right Bitcoin dominance was going up during the 2019 rally but it was going down for a lot of of that rally right and so this rally right dominance has just been sort of on a tear slowly but surely during the entire R making me still think it's more like late business cycle QT um you know before we inevitably get to rate cuts and and everything that comes with that so uh that's what I'm looking at right now it's been about 20 to 21 weeks since we tested the 20we ese you know I I don't know how long it's going to take but whenever we do test it it's it's going going to be one hell of a test especially given how long it's been since we since we last tested anyways if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom links in the description below we have got you know hundreds if not thousands of charts for all sorts of different cryptocurrencies and equities and macro and all that sort of stuff so make sure you guys check that out lock in the low R links in the description below into the crypto.com I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-03-10 00:00:00,"The video provides a detailed technical analysis of the Bitcoin market, focusing on the 20-week simple moving average (SMA) and 21-week exponential moving average (EMA) as key support levels. The presenter notes that Bitcoin has not tested these moving averages in over 20 weeks, which historically has signaled a potential reversal in the trend. However, the presenter also acknowledges the difficulty in predicting the exact timing and magnitude of a potential pullback, given the manic nature of the current market. The overall sentiment is cautiously bullish, with the presenter suggesting that a larger correction could occur later this year, potentially coinciding with events like the Bitcoin halving or the launch of a Bitcoin spot ETF. The presenter advises having a plan to navigate the market regardless of the short-term price action, rather than trying to time the top precisely.The main message and conclusion of the video is that the prolonged period without Bitcoin testing its key moving average support levels raises the risk of a more significant pullback, but the exact timing and extent of such a correction remains highly uncertain.",214,"[0.028869629, -0.0003080368, -0.010772705, -0.0062942505, -0.0037250519, -0.026931763, 0.05267334, -0.00894928, 0.047698975, 0.035095215, -0.01689148, -0.014656067, 0.024978638,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin versus dxy or the US dollar currency index if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom let's go and jump in so I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with one of the general trends that we've seen basically throughout the last several Market cycles and what it essentially consists of is that as Bitcoin goes up the US dollar tends to be going down and vice versa right so if the dollar is going up then Bitcoin tends to be going down and we've seen this happen on on more than one occasion right so if you were to Simply take the chart of Bitcoin and overlay the US dollar currency index onto the chart one of the things you'll note and and let me actually switch this over to a weekly time frame one of the things you may note here generally speaking right is that as as the dollar goes parabolic Bitcoin tends to be in a bare market right and as the dollar goes down aggressively Bitcoin tends to be in a bull market right and again here right the dollar was going down aggressively Bitcoin was going up aggressively over here the dollar was going up while Bitcoin was going down and we've seen this trend play out over and over and over again but what's interesting is is that despite by looks right despite by looks it certainly seems like they're inversely correlated that's not always true right and again the the way to check that is to just simply go over to say a a per piing correlation Coe coefficient Matrix and and look at bitcoin's correlation to the dollar and you can see that it's 28 right so it's not highly positively correlated it's not highly negatively correlated it's near zero if we go look at the Spearman correlation coefficient for it it's about 044 so a little bit more slightly positive but there's still no denying that you know through aggressive moves by the dollar we have seen Bitcoin fall and then through aggressive drops by the dollar we have seen Bitcoin go up but as you can see there are times where Bitcoin goes up while the dollar goes up right there are times where that has happened but I think the main difference is these these moves here are more or less parabolic moves by the dollar and and of course Bitcoin and risk Assets in general do not like it when the when the dollar is getting these types of parabolic moves but one interesting thing that we've talked talked about with respect to the dollar is that and I don't know if it's going to continue but I I I posted a a a a post on X a few weeks ago saying that it looks like the dollar is potentially mimicking the Bitcoin dominance accumulation phase a year or two ago and if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about if we were to pull up Bitcoin dominance here on the on the screen it's the green line down there okay now I just want to observe and again you know just because it played out like this on on one metric doesn't mean that it has to play out like that on another metric but one of the things that I think about with the dollar is that you have this parabolic move and then this has basically just been digesting the move before I'm guessing eventually it will make another run for a while now it doesn't necessarily have to be a parabolic move like that one but it could slowly start to Trend back up again right especially how you see like in in 2019 you know as we especially as we got into you know later in later 2019 the dollar did start to Trend back up even after the FED started to cut rates okay so when you look though at at at Bitcoin dominance and the dollar you can see two very you know very clear Trends in fact right and and essentially goes like this it it it goes like a low a lower low and a lower low same thing here with the dollar right a low a lower low and a lower low and throughout that pattern you had a high a lower high and then a higher high same thing right you had a a um a high a lower high and then a higher high so that first part of the pattern played out almost identic Al to to bitcoin dominance and then what ultimately happened with the dollar is that it came back down and formed a higher low just like Bitcoin dominance came back down and formed a higher low and then from there Bitcoin dominance had a slightly higher low more or less a double bottom but if you look at like daily Wicks and whatnot it was a higher low and it was also a rejection off bull market sport band which essentially is what we've seen here by the dollar so I am curious if the dollar is sort of falling back in here to try to find either a double bottom or a slightly higher low right so as long as it's above you know 100.6 or so then it's still technically a higher low now this is something I've been following for a while again I I posted about it on x a number of weeks ago this very pattern when when the dollar was going up sort of suggesting that you know it could get rejected there in the short term for a shortterm move back to the downside before ultimately moving back up and actually if you look at at what happened in um in in 2013 right you'll see that the dollar fell around the same time of the year right so once we got we had this rally by the dollar in February and then once we got into March the dollar fell back down into late April right and so I I do Wonder if we're seeing something very similar play out here where it's it's falling back in and note too that when dominance came back in here It ultimately fell back to some of these levels that I had previously tested so you know if if it were to fall back into that level from April of 2023 then essentially it means going down you know somewhere between 100 to 101 now I don't know if it's going to go that low or not it it could also form a higher low somewhere you know anywhere between here but I do think that that pattern has a decent chance of playing out now the reason why that's important is because when we think about Bitcoin Bitcoin USD we we know that it it does tend to have some effect when the dollar is moving one way or the other right so over the last few weeks we've seen the dollar start to move back down and we've also seen Bitcoin moving up not only has Bitcoin moved up but also risk Assets in general have moved up over the last few weeks and we started to see the dollar fall it's also the same idea where we saw net liquidity fall um going in you know from in in February when we saw the dollar dropping and then once we got really into March back over here right it fell in February and then once we got back into March and into early April the net liquidity indicator showed showed that the liquidity went up and then it sort of slowly faded again and one of the reasons it faded over here was because the dollar was going up so I'm suggesting that you know once we get into like late May or sorry late April May time frame I I could see the net liquidity indicator sort of rolling back over and going back down because you know a lot of the central banks are still decreasing the size of their balance sheet and it's also sort of assuming that the dollar follows the pattern by Bitcoin dominance if it does not follow the pattern by Bitcoin dominance and it takes out these lows then that would be something completely different okay and uh you know if that happens we'll I'll make a video sort of addressing that but at least at the current time that is what I'm thinking is is a potentially like you know potentially likely outcome is is some form of a of a double bottom or a higher low you know somewhere between 100 to 101 you know even up to 102 potentially right anywhere in between and if you go look at at Bitcoin of course one of the things we've talked about a lot over the last several months is that what what what's essentially happening is that this rally by Bitcoin is is slowly breaking altcoins down off of their Bitcoin support levels right we've seen a lot of them already break support um but there still are more I think that will ultimately break support sometime you know in in in sort of the march to May time frame where ultimately all Bitcoin pairs break down and and that's one of the reasons why Bitcoin gets these rallies is because it's during these Bitcoin rallies where you can really see altcoins break down they can also break down on bitcoin drops but rallies by Bitcoin can also lead to to all Bitcoin pairs sort of falling and one of the things that we've mentioned is that we've noticed that there's been a lot of sort of like narrative driv driven stuff throughout this entire cycle right if you think back to the merge what eth did was it it essentially rallied hard into a month before the merge on its USD pair and then it faded and then into September into the actual merge ethusd put in a lower high but eth Bitcoin put in a higher high meaning the rest of the market was already showing weakness on USD pairs by September but because of the merge eth had another rally back up forming a lower high but the eth dominance went up and the eth Bitcoin pair went up and so with that in mind we've talked about this idea of getting some form of of a cool off phase by Bitcoin USD following the having right and you could always have sort of a local top in March followed by a lower or high in April you could even have the high in April if it were to follow something like 2021 right if it if it did something like um like the year-to-date Roi stuff of Bitcoin if you were to go look at 2024 if it were to follow 2021 right you know you could even go all the way out until potentially April um before before sort of seeing that fade into the summer and again you know this is all dubious speculation right it's certainly possible that Bitcoin says to hell with all that stuff we're just going to you know continue to ride the momentum for as long as we possibly can so I I don't want to give anyone the impression that this has to play out it's just something we've talked about for a while and given you know given the fact that we're seeing other Confluence like gold breaking out um like you know the fear and greed index sort of getting into the 90s it's now back into the 80s but it could certainly go back into the 90s especially as we get later into March and and especially closer to having it it seems like there's you know again there's a a lot of Confluence behind you know this this insane Mania phase around the having and then following the having the market potentially cools off for a little while which I think would be honestly a really good thing for the market if it's unable to cool off for a while that of course while everyone will be happy in the short term that might turn out to be uh over a longer period of time not the best outcome because the problem with you know crazy rallies is that you then sort of have to you then end up having to like digest that for a much longer period of time it's the same thing with like the dollar right when you get these crazy rallies by the dollar you don't have to digest that move for a long time before you can actually get another sustained move to the upside but one interesting thing we can do is we can look at Bitcoin risk verse the dollar right so if you're unfamiliar with the Bitcoin risk metric it's this metric that I I do frequently talk about on the channnel let me just scroll up over here and and and show you so the we have this Bitcoin risk metric that basically just says you know one strategy one potential strategy this is the strategy that I follow with Bitcoin is to ignore basically everything and I don't really care about the news I don't really care about you know what's the most recent narrative I don't care about any of that stuff I just want to know where is the Bitcoin risk right and right now it's at 0 707 but what's interesting is if you plot out the dollar right if you plot out the dollar and you color code the dxy by the Bitcoin risk you get something that looks kind of interesting right where you know you get these periods of of blue right where you're at really low risk with Bitcoin and it tends to correspond to the end of the dollar parabolic rallies right you can see that it occurred in 2014 2015 and also it occurred in 2022 and then as the dollar sort of works its way back down then the Bitcoin risk goes into much higher risk levels right much higher risk levels um as you can see back over here in 2017 and in 2021 and even after the dollar um you know after Bitcoin risk went here in December 2018 and the dollar then kind of Consolidated for a little bit it more or less went sideways you can see the Bitcoin risk went slightly up right and and here the dollar hasn't really been collapsing ever since over here it's been mostly just going sideways so it certainly seems like there's there's a lot of Confluence sort of coming to a crescendo in marchapril where not only do you have again gold breaking out you have Bitcoin dominance in an uptrend and I know today it's I I I see the comments right but I mean yes I I get that that dominance has taken a little bit of a hit here but if you just I mean if you just switch this over to a line I mean look at this chart you know I mean it's it's moved up to the highs yes it has been unable to durably broke those Highs but the fact that it's spending more or more time up in this range to me suggests that it's ultimately going to break and so you know what happens if it all plays out in a in a m in a matter that we've been discussing and that is you know you you have this risk on Dynamic by Bitcoin until approximately 56% dominance and if you're still looking at the fear and greed in the 90s gold is still sustaining that that breakout which I think it probably will if Blue Chip dominance breaks above 73% right now it's um at 72.2 and so on and so forth if all that comes to a crescendo at the same same time that the dollar is potentially you know finding a higher low or a double bottom in here then I I I think that that would be sort of some justification or a catalyst for the market to cool off sometime therea the haboc right and again if you if you were to look at at what eth did going into the merge if you remember ethusd right this was the merge right here and it it put in a high a month before the merge and then a lower high during the actual merge and then the market cooled off for a couple of months or so right it was much need to cool off too um after such an explosive move so I do wonder if if all this is kind of repeating itself where by you know sometime over the march to April time frames you see all Bitcoin pairs break down you see Bitcoin dominance break out you see gold continue its break out fear and greed relatively elevated the dollar making a U-turn potentially you know somewhere between 100 and 102 and so on and so forth then it might just be some Confluence to to to keep in mind right and again I mean the sort of the difficult part about all this is that I mean any any I mean any at any point of the way right you could sort of speculate why any asset needs to needs to find a local top I mean people have been trying to call the top on Nvidia forever and it just keeps on going up so to some degree trying to predict exactly where that would be in terms of price is is essentially a Fool's errand right I mean it's it's impossible but if you have enough Confluence I I I do wonder if if that would be sort of enough of a catalyst to to lead to sort of a cool off phase sometime following the having okay and and I I just wanted to sort of present this idea from The Stance of the dollar because it does seem like it's repeating you know a m you know a pattern that it has repeated before and then the Bitcoin risk seems to be repeating a pattern that it has repeated before and so again it all comes back to this idea of of you know can can Bitcoin St risk on long enough to break all Bitcoin pairs down and I I think it will break all Bitcoin pairs down and the question is is after it does that assuming that it does does then the dollar start to move back up as as we get into to the summertime but that's my view on on the dollar and on bitcoin and I I will'll see how it plays out I'm not going to make a video on the dollar that frequently I probably I don't even know if I'll make an update on this um but it is it is something that I I noticed some people were talking about recently because the dollar had a pullback and I was thinking back to that post where we talked about potentially One More pullback by the dollar followed by a move back up as we get into late April May June July Etc if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse

00:00:00,"The video discusses the historical inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the US dollar currency index (DXY), noting that while they appear to be inversely correlated, the actual correlation coefficient is near zero. The presenter suggests that the dollar may be mimicking the Bitcoin dominance accumulation pattern seen a year or two ago, potentially forming a double bottom or higher low between 100-102 before moving higher again. This could lead to a cool-off phase for Bitcoin after the upcoming halving event, similar to how Ethereum saw a lower high during the Merge despite its USD pair rallying. The presenter also highlights the confluence of factors, such as gold's breakout, Bitcoin dominance trending up, and the fear and greed index reaching elevated levels, that could catalyze this potential cool-off period for Bitcoin following the halving. Overall, the sentiment is cautiously bullish, with the presenter acknowledging the difficulty of predicting exact price movements but highlighting several technical and macro factors that could lead to a temporary consolidation in the crypto markets.The main message and conclusion is that the presenter believes the dollar may be following a similar pattern to Bitcoin dominance, potentially leading to a cool-off phase for Bitcoin after the upcoming halving, based on various technical and macro factors coming together.",249,"[0.04147339, 0.015113831, -0.0015573502, 0.02772522,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin dubious speculation if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out into the cryptoverse premium at into crypto.com we of course have the salees still running so make sure you guys check that out before we get started I I've seen a lot of people recently say um the same thing that they've always said for years and that's essentially hey your mic is too quiet it so I I went into my audio settings and I I adjusted the microphone so all I want to know from you is does this sound better or worse okay um let me know if it sounds better or worse and also let me know if if it's loud enough or if you think it needs to be louder or if it's too loud right it would be worthwhile for me to know the answer to that question um so just let me know what you think with regards to the microphone I'm just trying to make it a little bit better but I'm not going to go buy another microphone um I think the internal one is is is just fine so anyways Bitcoin is is now at at around 62 to 63k and we did run the highs today which is something that we said was you know was likely going to happen given the momentum and and especially given the fact that all Bitcoin pairs still had that liquidity that that they could afford to give over to bitcoin right and and so we did run the highs um for the first time ever before the having right so Bitcoin has never run the highs before the having before so that is a first and and it also makes me think that this cycle will continue to throw us curve balls one after another historically new highs come after the having suggesting right certainly suggesting that this cycle is throwing us a curveball right again that's just the nature of it we've said for for a long time that we are are definitely more heated right now going into the having than we ever have been um and and it's just kind of notable right it's notable to say that look like it's been a solid runup over the last you know 15 16 months and and Bitcoin just swept the highs so a lot of things to talk about and you know there there certainly seems like there's a lot of Confluence amongst a number of the indicators and and charts that we've been looking at over the last year and a half and so in this video I do want to go through a lot of those things now we do go a lot through a lot of those things in the last two live streams that we did but it was more like a a a sort of like a a stream of Consciousness for me um in this video I want to go through each one very slowly and and and just kind of talk about where we are right so there's a lot of things that I I think are are notable to think about and and if we were to go through each one right one of which is that Bitcoin dominance to 56% first and then 60% right and the reason why I separate those is because you know the move to 56% could be characterized differently than from 56 to 60 assuming that it happens okay this is something that we've been talking about for years now right back when dominance was at like 39% and now that we are finally getting very close it's one thing that we have to be aware of that it it it signifies that the cryptoverse is healing right that's what it it symbolizes that it's healing and and and that's just a natural part of the cycle it's it's not this time is not different in in that regard I still have never understood why the Bitcoin dominance thesis was so contentious when it's just kind of what it does at you know during higher rates in QT so that is something that it seems like it's happening but it hasn't happened yet right so we can't really check that one off there's still work to do I think we I think we're going to make it there right but there's still some work to do with that if we go check in on our favorite Bitcoin pair metric total 3 minus USD divided by Bitcoin the argument is that we should see a weekly close below 04 meaning a weekly close at 39 or below and if and when that happens it should Mark a turning point in the cryptoverse in terms of altcoins should then bleed down against Bitcoin relatively quickly for a long time we have seen altcoins flirt with the low but being unwilling to actually go below the range low just like we saw last cycle right just like I it's the same thing and back then after putting in that Wick low it took 41 weeks to break down now I don't know how long it's going to take to break down but I do think that liquidity will make its way back over to bitcoin it's it's been about 36 weeks so 41 weeks would put us out in April so just about another month from now it could of course occur sooner but just something to say hey guys we've been talking about this forever it seems like we're heading in that direction and if that materializes it's important to understand what happened the last time right and the last time that happened occurred just before the FED cut rates right over interest rates I mean it I swear it feels like a crescendo where everything is converging right so you can see that when all Bitcoin pairs broke down it corresponded to just before the First Rate cut arrived and if we go and look at at sort of Market expectations for monetary policy which again is subject to change and I don't I don't really put a lot of faith in these probabilities right now the market is suggesting the first cut arrives in June and I could be on board with that idea I certainly could be on board with that idea but there's there's a part of me that thinks like maybe they'll actually do one in May again looking at this I would tend to defer to what the market is saying I don't think I have any special Insight compared to the collective you know group of investors that are are sort of looking at this stuff but if all Bitcoin pairs were to break down let's say sometime between now and and the beginning of April we know that last time that happened the FED cut the following month and so the next meeting after the March meeting let's assume they're not cutting in March I imagine the labor market data would have to come out pretty awful for them to cut in March so we'll see what that comes in at but assuming it's not that awful then let's suppose the first real chance of a cut is may still only a 21.7% chance again the odds I imagine still favor a June cut um but we'll see if if if they can you know if they can make it that long so going back over to this metric looking at total 3 minus usdt Bitcoin we're at 42% now right we're at 42% now and all it takes is a weekly close at 39 that's all it takes and again I don't know if it's going to play out the same way as last cycle I really don't but just remember that last cycle when that happened right when when all Bitcoin pairs broke down all USD pairs also had a larger correction okay again could this could this time be different could be I'm just pointing out what happened last time you know you can use that information and and make your own decisions and I think the point is to say like it doesn't have to play out a certain way but you should understand that there is a risk right and and that risk also materialized back in 2019 just when people you know thought it couldn't happen um so I would say just keep an eye on it something we've been talking about forever but it still hasn't actually broken down yet right so again putting this over here right total 3 minus usdt divided by Bitcoin weekly close below 39 hasn't happened yet but again it seems like we're building up it seems like there's a crescendo where a lot of these things are slowly occurring and a lot of people don't really want to believe it but we're kind of heading in that direction right and the other thing that's sort of a derivative of all this stuff of course is the eth Bitcoin pair which I think will eventually get a weekly close below 049 okay now remember last cycle e Bitcoin had a weekly close below the range low two weeks after all Bitcoin pairs broke down suggesting that alt Bitcoin pairs would likely break down before eth Bitcoin because ethereum is a relatively safer asset compared to altcoins some people would say eth is also an altcoin and by the strictest definitions it is but when I refer to altcoins I'm talking about everything besides Bitcoin and eth all right so in that sense in that sense it seems like we are heading that direction but in the short term we know that it could take some time for us to get there while alt Bitcoin pairs broke down a month before rate Cuts eth Bitcoin broke down the same month as rate Cuts in the last cycle so it could hold on a bit longer and we do know there's the whole spot ETF stuff for ethereum coming up potentially in May I don't know if it's going to be approved or not but one thing to to continue to sort of keep in mind is that there's this fractal right here which we've actually been following pretty closely so far right if you think about it right we had a a a a big move up and then a move back down where it bottomed sort of in in in early to mid-February and it came back up and put in a lower high we saw the same thing here right it went up here it came back down and it and it found a low in mid-February came back up put in a lower high but you can see that from that point it was a very slow bleed back down basically where eth Bitcoin only marginally dropped throughout the entire month of March and then the drop started to pick up in April and again if you think about what's happening in April we have a Bitcoin having coming up and so I think that Bitcoin should remain stronger than ethereum not only because of the having narrative but also because we saw eth bleed to bitcoin until we went back to QE last cycle and we haven't seen that yet again we haven't even seen that occur yet looking at the the the balance sheet by the FED e Bitcoin Bott precisely at where the FED shifted from QT to QE so we haven't seen a rate cut we haven't seen the shift from QT to q and we also have the Bitcoin having coming up three great reasons why I think eth Bitcoin will eventually bleed back down to the range lows and eventually give us a weekly close below 049 so that's the next thing is that eth Bitcoin should get a weekly close below 049 so again all three of these things are all kind of the same thing right they're all more or less the same thing but it's just certain mileston to keep in mind that hey these things are are sort of you know Milestones that we've we've been looking looking towards again it doesn't have to be what you want to happen and it might not happen it's just that based on the historical record these are Milestones that are likely going to happen at some point and so it's worthwhile to be prepared for that potential outcome whether you want it to happen or not right whether you want it to happen or not um so all three of those things I think are are slowly occurring but none of them have actually happened yet right and again like until they actually happen it's still just a theory but there's other things that are starting to happen and and that already have happened and and one of those is gold breaking out right this is something and actually before we get to gold breaking out the next thing I want to to touch on because it relates to these is Bitcoin dominance plus e dominance we have said I have said that this this should get a weekly close greater than 73% so Bitcoin dominance plus eth dominance to get a weekly close greater than 73% and the reason is because that would actually correspond to the breakout point do you notice over here we also Bitcoin dominance plus e dominance we're going to call it Blue Chip dominance I consider e the blue chip but the reason I haven't been optimistic on it for so long is because it's just bleeding back to bitcoin and bitcoin's relatively safer so I'm not going to concern myself if alts are bleeding to eth because if eth is bleeding to bitcoin then alts are also bleeding to bitcoin so in that sense you can see that last cycle despite the fact that stable coins were were more a part of this cycle than last cycle we also had troubl seeing the Bitcoin plus the the Blue Chip dominance breaking through 73% and once it did once it broke Bitcoin cooled off for a little bit right we saw Bitcoin kind of cool off for about half a year it then started to rally and then we got the pandemic we got it you know everything got rined and then QE came back so 73% and we're not that far away right I mean we're at 72.83 per. um and I I you know if you look at it it looks familiar right I mean we are building up to it still not a weekly close above but it's not that far away and so you have all all four of these things which are essentially derivatives of each other and they're all sort of building up to the same thing now it's harder for Blue Chip dominance to go up because eth dominance usually goes down when Bitcoin dominance goes up so in order for the weekly in order to get a weekly close above 73% Bitcoin dominance has to go up more than eth dominance is going down that's why it takes a lot longer so all all four of these things it seems like we're building up to but we still haven't seen them yet now the thing which again is somewhat Loosely related is usdt dominance going to approximately 4% approximately right and the reason why I say approximately is because you know this is more of a handwavy type thing they're all handwavy to be completely honest but if you were to go look at the usct dominance we've sort of outlined this for a long time that um usdt dominance has this habit of going back to this trend line and once it gets to that trend line then it starts to make a U-turn right and and again to some degree trend lines are made to be broken and I'm not going to say I'm not you know this is not a hill I'm going to die on you know the usct dominance frankly I don't really care about it but I'm just pointing out that every time it previously hit this trend line Bitcoin did have a larger pullback right November 2021 March 2021 February 2020 June 2019 November 2018 even though we were you know a year into a bar Market almost we still had another big drop after that and then December 2017 so every time we hit this trend line something happened right here it was high inflation right over here it was what probably China Banning Bitcoin this was the pandemic right this you know June 2019 was was just before rate Cuts arrived November 2018 you know we had we had some crypto specific things I'm not going to get into that right now December 2017 was of course the all-time high at 20K back at the end of that bull market so every single time there was something right that was given as a reason maybe maybe just maybe if it does bounce off of this trend line and usct dominance goes back up as as people maybe go back into some stable coins um I I do or not necessarily as people go back into stable coins but just as as the market cap of of of some cryptos might not hold up as well it could be because of s yield curve on inversion right I I do think that yield curve on inversion could be kind of the narrative around the next balance potentially off this trend line now the reason why I say that it's not so clear is because with trend lines I one of the reasons I don't like about trend lines because you can easily adjust them and tell whatever story you want to tell I could I could drop this trend line all the way down here and it doesn't really look like anything has changed and it takes it from basically 4% all the way down to 3.75 right so that's the problem with Trends with trend lines like this I I prefer horizontal trend lines you know like what we were looking at with like say the Blue Chip dumps I prefer horizontal trend lines I think they mean a lot more than these sorts of trend lines but again I mean this is just something that we've talked about for a while we did a whole video on this back when usdt dominance had approached 6 and a half% just a few weeks ago and I said guys look this could very well drop down to 4% as we get a rotation a big rotation into Bitcoin going into the having and we're already there you could argue that we've already tagged the trend line but again it's one of those things where you could adjust this trend line fairly easily and say all right that we haven't tagged it yet but maybe we'll tag it in a couple of weeks um so that's something that we can say has sort of occurred right hasn't yet occurred technically uh I don't think we technically hit 4% we went down down to oh we did we went down to 3.98 so we have hit it right we have hit that 4% threshold so that is something I think we can say look I mean you know whether that ends up being something material that we're going to look back on and be like oh yeah it was kind of obvious it's happened right and and again it's important to recognize that this thing we've been tracking for a while it's happen now some people would say well why don't you include usdc domus we could do that too but I don't really think you're going to you're going to find much difference in it it's basically telling the same story right this is usdt dominance plus usdc dominance so it tells a a fairly similar story so that is something that has already occurred now the next thing is gold breaking out right gold breaking out this is sort of the next thing that we've talked about and gold is breaking out and I don't know that it's it's sort of definitive yet I I think that it would be still somewhat premature um we had a wick you know a few weeks ago to higher levels right I mean it it went all the way up to 2146 which is still higher than we've gone so until we actually get a weekly close up here it still could theoretically be a fake out right I mean imagine if if gold went back down to less than 2070 by the end of the week and this is nothing more than a wick then you start to wonder the reason I think it's not it might not be a fake out is that the the the level that I said previously was a a weak ly close above 2070 and we got that last week we had a weekly close of 2082 and now it seems like we're seeing follow through this week again I would like to see another weekly closeup here if we get another weekly closeup here then that would seem like confirmation to me that gold is breaking out the reason why that's important is BEC for Bitcoin is because when when when gold broke out over here it meant something right and and again Bitcoin didn't top out it didn't find a local top immediately when it broke out it took about another week Bitcoin cooled off for a while then we had another run but again it's something to consider that gold is potentially breaking out at the same time that all these other things are are sort of In Motion right they all these things are kind of in motion and so that is something that is also happening right so these two things we could argue have already happened right the next thing that we've talked about is the fear and greed index going into the '90s now it's back down to 75 now so it took a pretty big hit if you go look at the fear and greed index here it is is back at 75 but we've talked a lot about if you overlay just say the 92100 range right we've hit it just like we did hit it over here and just like we hit it in 2019 also during QT and high rates my contention is that when people say is it like 2019 or 2020 it it's like 2024 It's a combination of the two It's a combination of quantitative tightening and high rates but also a combination of all-time highs so it's not 2019 it's not 2021 it's 2024 where it's kind of something in between right you know it's it's occurring during tighter monetary policy where Bitcoin dominance is going up while all Bitcoin pairs are bleeding but it's also occurred at an all-time high what's fascinating to me is that this rally at this point was a 345 rally why is that interesting well the reason why that's interesting is because this rally in 2019 during QT and high rates was also about 340% or so right so a very similar rally but the difference is that in this case it actually left to an all to an all-time high right because because of diminished return diminished volatility to the downside a 300% rally actually gets you to alltime highs so we run the highs we ran the highs before the Havoc so again the fear and greed index has hit 90 so again I I go to these ideas of like it it still seems like we're experiencing a lot of Confluence with all these things that we've talked about forever gold breaking out fearing greed index hit 90 usct dominance hit 4% Blue Chip dominance is nearing 73% eth Bitcoin still a ways to go to 0049 all Bitcoin pairs not that far to go to 39 Bitcoin dominance still a little bit ways away from 56% so a lot of things right so that of course everyone wants to know what's going to happen with Bitcoin right and again I I can't really say for sure obviously I don't have a crystal ball um but what I would say is that my guess is that whatever happens going into the having the dominance of Bitcoin is going up meaning that if you do get a a a rent in crypto where it goes down a lot more I would guess the dominance would go higher if you watched closely earlier when Bitcoin was only down about 2 to 3 % altcoins were kind of still holding but the minute Bitcoin went down 5 to 6% altcoins took a huge hit so if Bitcoin were to drop whether it's back down to say like the 20we SMA um or you know like the 100 day SMA right anything like that I would expect dominance to go higher if on the other hand Bitcoin continues to sort of slowly grind back up I'm getting yes in dominance also goes up and there still is liquidity in altcoins that I think will make their way over to bitcoin I mean they're making their way over to bitcoin right now right I mean Bitcoin hasn't really been moving today I mean look at look at Bitcoin USD it's down but alt Bitcoin pairs are mostly down right I mean eth Bitcoin is up 0.13% at the time of this video but look at all these altcoins right they're down the crypto verse is is slowly healing right so again it it it seems like we're building up to this Crescendo where all Bitcoin pairs are breaking down just as Bitcoin dominance is hitting these Milestones USD dominance is hitting its Milestone gold is breaking out Blue Chip dominance hitting its Milestone etc etc etc now again I you know is is 69k the the level that we just hit is that going to be the top for a while it could be I I don't I really don't know I I really don't I'm just trying to to be honest I don't know I don't have a strong conviction on whether we go above that in the short term or not um I still think there's liquidity in alt that'll make their way back over to bitcoin I don't know if it's going to be sufficient in the short term to take it to a new high or not it it's probably going to be somewhat dependent on on you know spot ETF flows and you know one thing I've always been curious about with the whole spot ETF stuff is I imagine that the people that hold those are not your typical Diamond hand hodlers right because if they're Diamond hand hodlers they're not they weren't waiting for the spot ETF to buy Bitcoin you know that wouldn't make any sense so I'm curious you know after a day like today what happens do the flows keep on coming do they take a hit for a little while right I don't know so I would keep an eye on that I would keep an eye on the flows there I would I I would still look at the all coins because again the the issue for Bitcoin USD that it's going to have to contend with is that it's been it's had basically like three really good sources of flows spot ETF the regular DCA and people that just kind of keep giving up on altcoins and converting them back to the king you might say well Ben even if altcoins go below 39 who cares right people could still convert their altcoins to bitcoin therefore there's still those flows coming in and while that may be true the the problem is that the purchasing power of those altcoins to buy Bitcoin has diminished so at one point you know the eth Bitcoin ratio was at 8% right now it's at like 5 and a half% so again as as these as these all Bitcoin pairs bleed that then as people continue to convert them to bitcoin they just cannot buy as much Bitcoin because the value of those altcoins have gone down so much and when all Bitcoin pairs broke last cycle they then went down very quickly after that right from when they broke they then dropped another like 40% within just a couple of months or so so the purchasing power of all Bitcoin pairs could go down very quickly if the range lows break and and again that is kind is is something that Bitcoin USD will have to contend with that you know and again I don't know the answer right I'm just saying like at some point the liquidity in the altcoin market will not be as much as it once was to buy Bitcoin and one of the reasons is because Bitcoin USD has gone up so much and altcoins just simply cannot compete you know I mean the problem with altcoins is that there's so many of them and you have everyone trying to convince you why their altcoin is the best all while Bitcoin dominance just keeps on going higher you know so you have to be careful right you really have to be careful and I'm not I'm not like anti altcoins I I do think there's more to the cryptoverse than Bitcoin I just think that we you're in a phase of the cycle where alts bleed back to the king and it has nothing to do with the fundamentals of any of the different cryptocurrency projects I've I've heard for years now why eth should outperform Bitcoin because if we're in a bull run eth outperforms Bitcoin again I I think what people are failing to recognize and I've said this many many times is that eth outperforms Bitcoin in a q bull run right in a q bll run right this was a QE bull run over here and and and eth Bitcoin went up this was a QT bull run this was a QT bull run right here in 2019 where you know the Fed was draining you know draining assets off the balance sheet Bitcoin USD went up but eth Bitcoin was going down when the when the balance sheet was going up and Bitcoin was going up eth Bitcoin was also going up so a lot of people keep saying well like eth outperforms Bitcoin in a bull run I'm like yeah in a QE Bull Run but in a qt Bull Run Bitcoin remains Supreme in terms of your risk adjusted returns and and the problem with e during QT and high rates is that it is riskier than Bitcoin Bitcoin is fundamentally safer it's more sound it's been around for longer it's the higher market cap coin and so you're taking on more risk with altcoins and in a lot of cases you're getting a lower return there are some altcoins that that that stand outside of that sort of generalization and some of these altcoins are actually doing quite okay but I always said there would be some but the general trend for alt Bitcoin pairs is down so it is true that in a in a QE bull run all you know eth Bitcoin can go up but in a qt Bull Run eth Bitcoin goes down right and so you know while eth Bitcoin is is fading you kind of have people saying well it's holding up well the entire way that it just keeps on bleeding right and and that's kind of the the issue is that everyone's sort of living in in 2020 in 2020 and 2021 QE bull market when they really should be looking at what happened over here when the Fed was you know was was much more strict and that's why the dominance is going up right is because of higher risk assets continue to bleed to lower risk assets and you know there's a lot of altcoins that are bleeding to eth right now in fact the eth dominance has held up pretty well in fact given the circumstances but it is still slowly fading right it is still slowly fading it actually has been moving up a little bit here since December um but I mean you could see that it's been putting in lower highs really since November of 2021 um so again that's something that is is worthwhile to to consider so we have all these things right we have all these things happening and the other thing is um you know if you look at at even like say net liquidity and you look at at at what happened a year ago right Bitcoin USD found a local top kind of in in the surge of net liquidity that finalized in early April and you can see that net liquidity kind of turned the corner here in late February early March which it sort of looks like it's doing this time as well so imagine if in a few weeks we have all Bitcoin pairs breaking down Bitcoin breaking down Bitcoin dominance at 56% the fear and greed index you know it's already hit the it's already hit the hit the Milestone maybe it hits it again gold still holding on and and usct dominance has already hit its Milestone right you can just kind of see how the Confluence is all there right so what's the what's the thing right what what will cause all Bitcoin pairs to actually throw in the towel right what will cause it well if you look closely at last cycle and if you look at at monetary policy and you look at at the yield curve you look at Treasure yield spreads one of the things you may note is that while it wasn't talked about nearly as much as it has been this cycle we did have an inverted yield curve in fact 10 year and the three the three-month uh yields treasuries were inverted and you can see that basically I mean it was it inverted in May of 2019 and then it uninverted in October so all Bitcoin pairs broke support what was that in June so July July August September October so four months right four months before the yield curve uninverted I don't know when the yield curve is going to uninverted up till then right and if it does then you might not get a an uninverted yield curve right away right you could see all Bitcoin pairs break down before the yield curve un inverts and then when the yield curve actually uninverted kind of like it did over here in late September early October guess what that corresponded to when the yield curve uninverted you know what it corresponded to it corresponded to the FED going back to the to the Market's Favorite Drug QE right QE QE returned in September 2019 and in September 2019 all Bitcoin pairs bottomed right there literally to the T all Bitcoin pairs bottomed when we went from QT from QT to QE and when we went from QT to QE it was upon yield curve un inversion so we're just sort of thinking ahead here what if we get yield curve inversion in a few months but that makes sense absolutely did you know that the median time the median amount of months that it has taken for the FED to start cutting is eight and March we're actually in the eth month after the Pauls this is this is month number eight if you don't believe me which you should not right never never believe blind statements like you know ask me to prove it or or if I don't say hey you need to actually show it if you look at at at interest rates right if we just pull us interest rates up you can see pretty clearly here let me get rid of all this stuff you can see pretty clearly here right that we paused in July and we're now what it's more than six months right because July is um so July so August September October November December January February March right so it's eight months I'm not really sure why it's showing oh because it's it's including that's sort of the the distance right it's not it's kind of like skipping one I guess but and I guess it'll it'll update right right now it's just showing it that's the problem it's just showing it through January here um because that was the last meeting but if you extend this out till March which is where we are right now it's at 8 right at 8 months and 8 months says the median number of months after a pause I believe until the FED pivots if you go back and and look at all the prior data right I mean there's different there's different lengths of time this one over here was like 6 months this one there was was 14 um here it was seven um there's all sorts of different ones right four but again like on average right it's about eight months or so again most Cycles are not average right it's the if you if you average everything everything out that's what you of course you get the average but I mean every cycle is different and and some are going to be shorter than the average some are going to be longer than the average and unless we get a cut this month it's going to be longer than average so if we don't get a cut in March and we don't get a cut in in May then maybe we get a cut I don't know in in June or July so probably you're going to get at least a cut between May and July is my guess I don't know if it'll be in May I don't know if it'll be in June or July but I'm guessing you're going to cut get a cut somewhere around there and that I think think could be sort of the next narrative that we're looking at and when the FED starts to cut that could lead to to a shift from QT to QE which could lead to bitcoin dominance topping and all Bitcoin pairs bottoming so it it seems like all these things we've been talking about are slowly happening even though it it it feels like every step of the way it wasn't right but it looks like it looks like we're trending in all these different directions at the same time and so that's why I say I feel like we're building up to a crescendo where kind of everything's happening and and you could even argue that that I mean maybe the crescendo was was today where it where it hit the all-time highs again there's there's plenty of counterpoints right the the points to say that crescendo's behind us is the fact that gold is breaking out usdt dominance went to 4% the fear and greed index is it already hit 90 the counterpoints to all that though are that all Bitcoin Pairs and eth Bitcoin still haven't broken down yet suggesting there's still some liquidity is there enough liquidity to send it to a new high I don't know the answer to that question I don't um I would defer to someone else that is is better at predicting Bitcoin USD than I am um but I would say that these are sort of the process the process of all this stuff is is playing out it's just taking a a very long time for it to do so trying to think are there any other things to touch on um those are the main things that I I I believe that I wanted to to mention um just going over to the uh to the website here Bitcoin risk 689 we did go to the point 7 to point8 risk band right we did hit that level so these are the 7 to point8 is highlighted on the chart we did hit that level note that in 2019 we only went up to0 6 to 7 so that did occur um if you look at at stuff like the stable coin Supply ratio oscillator it kind of seems like it's doing what it always does um putting in some highs and after the highs are in it slowly bleeds down while Bitcoin continues to climb the wall of worry right it's been doing the same thing as always so that hasn't really changed my guess and again I I could easily be wrong but my guess is that we're sort of like leading into like we've already seen the high for a little while or we get you know we get another run up and we you know we go higher uh but I'm guessing that whenever that's all said and done whether it's now whether it's in April or May we're then going to cool off for a while and then the next discussion will ultimately be was that it or do we get another one right do we get something else maybe later in the having year maybe in the post having year the last three Cycles we saw Bitcoin Peak out in Q4 of the having year or sorry in the post having year those Cycles also didn't see Bitcoin in new all-time highs this soon but it is something to think about and you know another another really interesting way to look at the market is is to look at sort of the ROI from the peak and and from the lows and if you take it from the peak um um Roi after latest cycle Peak well that's looking at all of them um here it is so if you look at it like this and go Peak to Peak we're really far ahead of where we normally are so even if there were larger pullback after the having or something it's not like I mean again at this point in the last two cycles Bitcoin was still down 66% from the highs I mean again like think about that in the last two cycles as measured Peak to Peak Bitcoin was still down 66% from the high in this way it look looks like we are really far extended very extended but do you know how everyone talked about April being the top and not November I was one of them right saying April was a more technical top in a lot of ways what's interesting is if you look at this chart as measured from April instead of November we're kind of where we usually are right doesn't really look that weird when you look at it like that does it you can also look at it as measured from the lows right and in that case if you measure it from the lows and you just look at the last couple of Cycles we're also extended right so that's why I keep going to this idea of like yeah like I don't know how long it's going to last for you know if it's over already or we get another run up but my guess is that at some point you know post having or something could happened before but I mean we've been very narrative driven so far I don't know why that would change but at some point I imagine there's a larger draw down and and and then that's kind of the next discussion in the cryptoverse is do we get another run and again I mean what's fascinating about it is even if we had a larger drop we could still be where we were at prior in Prior Cycles at the same time the problem for altcoins is that if Bitcoin does get a larger drop sometime in the next few months the issue is that a lot of these Al KN were even close to their all-time highs think about that right think about that they're nowhere even close and if Bitcoin drops and altcoins are still 70% below their lows that's why it's so difficult to be an altcoins over Bitcoin because dominance just keeps on going up but the the the trick though is that if Al if altcoins do bleed against Bitcoin and the Bitcoin dominance goes to 60% and something happens in the labor market leading to the yield curve inversion and there's a larger sell-off in Risk assets and then the FED pivots and goes back to QE Everyone by that point has been converted into a Bitcoin Maxi and not everyone but a lot of people have been converted to bitcoin Maxis because they just spent 3 years watching all most of these alls bleed to bitcoin right but then by that time QE comes back and then finally e starts to durably outperform bitcoin and the cycle goes on and the cycle goes on and the cycle goes on so again I don't I don't make the rules I just try to enforce them right and that's the kind of the the way the crypto verse works is you have different types of monetary policy that lead to different types of behavior in the cryptoverse and that's kind of where we are right so I yeah I do think that there's probably going to be a larger pullback at some point it could be post having for all I know um and and it could be it could be a pullback from a higher price too right but if and when that occurs look at altcoins during that time and then you know you know you could still see Bitcoin well well off well off its prior low but all coins could be you know could be struggling a bit especially on their Bitcoin pairs right on their Bitcoin pairs they're still putting in new lows I mean they are and the altcoin Reckoning was always as I stated in almost every single altcoin Reckoning video the altcoin Reckoning was the devaluation of altcoins on their Bitcoin Pairs and here we sit in March of the having year and we're not even that far away from seeing altcoins put in new lows on their Bitcoin pairs some altcoins are already doing it right madic Bitcoin is already putting in new lows avac Bitcoin it's bleeding back down I'm guessing it's going to come back to this line eventually at the very least right poor Litecoin all it knows how to do is put in new lows against Bitcoin xrp Bitcoin just keeps on putting in new lows right I mean I mean this is this was a low from you know 2020 but if you look at at the lows from say like 2022 and 2023 it just keeps on putting in new lows so for every person that that you know has has gone after Bitcoin dominance in favor of xrp look at the chart dot Bitcoin not that far away from a new low a Bitcoin putting in new lows this week B&B Bitcoin could easily go down and put in new lows link Bitcoin is it is it just another double top right here I don't know even so Bitcoin has been stronger than a lot of the other ones no doubt about it but it is still slowly fading right and if it if it can't hold here at its bull market support band then you're likely looking at it going back down to 12,000 sets from 19,000 maker Bitcoin has been heading back down right at a Bitcoin it's not even that far off the lows right it's back below 1100 SATs the lows are like 800 SATs just another 20% drop but it's putting in new lows basically so when you think about like the altcoin Reckoning and and think think about the devaluation of altcoins on their Bitcoin pairs what if they just keep on putting in new lows then was the altcoin Reckoning ever even over even though people think it was if they keep on getting devalued against Bitcoin probably not so again you know I I go back to this idea of like it seems like we are kind of building up to this Crescendo where all of these things are slowly playing out some of them have already played out like the fear and greed index said 90 or above gold breaking out still need to confirm that so we'll wait usct dominance around 4% we still need to see this happen so this one hasn't happened this one hasn't happened this one hasn't happened and this one hasn't happened but what if they all happen if they all happen then I'd like to think that the thesis was was true and and that we a lot of people just didn't have the patience to wait it out but remember the business cycle takes years to play out years so it's easy to get lost it's easy to get lost in the day-to-day stuff but anyways those are my views on the market um again if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the

00:00:00,"The video discusses various technical analysis indicators and metrics suggesting the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, is nearing a critical juncture that could lead to a period of Bitcoin dominance increasing at the expense of altcoins.Key points:
- Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs before the halving event, which is historically unusual, suggesting the current cycle may continue to defy expectations.
- Bitcoin dominance is expected to rise to 56% and then 60%, signaling a healing of the broader crypto market.
- The ratio of total altcoin market cap to Bitcoin (TOTAL3-USD/BTC) is nearing a critical level of 0.39, which previously marked a turning point for altcoins bleeding against Bitcoin.
- The Ethereum-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair is expected to eventually break below 0.049, following the pattern from the previous cycle.
- Gold has broken out, which the host sees as a potentially significant development in relation to the crypto market.
- The Fear & Greed Index reaching the 90s, along with other indicators, suggests a high degree of confluence in the market signals.The host believes the crypto market is heading towards a crescendo of events that could lead to a period of Bitcoin dominance increasing at the expense of altcoins. This is due to factors like the potential for yield curve inversion, the Fed's monetary policy shifts, and the continued devaluation of altcoins against Bitcoin. The host suggests that even if Bitcoin experiences a larger pullback, altcoins may struggle more, leading to further Bitcoin dominance.",327,"[0.015029907, -0.012123108, 0.0007724762, -0.0018844604,

Hi, let's try again and see if Bitcoin can hit a new all-time high today uh we are only couple hundred dollars away from it so um it's always nice to catch them live if we can and then we can kind of go back and watch um and just see it you know for the sort of for the history books but we'll see if we can make new all-time highs I mean we've already done it on the Euro we've already done it by market cap it seems like the USD evaluation is is the next to fall and so we'll see if we can actually take that out and you know over the night I noticed that a lot of altcoins surged against Bitcoin um which right I mean you guys know the the the implication of that right it just means that the liquidity from M will just go right back to bitcoin right it's because of the phase of the again I could be wrong I mean I I get wrong I I'm wrong about a lot of stuff but normally when when this kind of stuff happens um in in in this phase of the market cycle under the current you know conditions if it if it goes to altcoins it just comes right back right it comes right back to bitcoin and and then Bitcoin uses that as fuel to to ultimately try to move higher right um so we are getting pretty close um if we look at at the prior highs uh you can see we are only about a 100 someone's saying that we already had a new alltime high is that true yeah I know you guys want me to draw the house um I guess we'll draw the house admittedly I think I I I I think we are there's a lot of Confluence right now I mean you know you have you have again when we covered a lot of this yesterday right you have dominance moving up near the breakout point you have gold breaking out you have all Bitcoin pairs they were breaking down they surged a little bit over the night and so um again I I I think that liquidity will just go right right back to bitcoin and and you know you give it another day or two and and and Bitcoin dominance should be even higher um  that is my my expectation is that is that the alt coins go go right back to bitcoin and it's interesting because you know a lot of the um the stock market not not the stock market as a whole the S&P 500 is actually doing quite well or it has been but some of the Magnificent 7 you know continue to be stuck in in traffic on struggle Street I mean Apple Tesla Google not really doing that great um and I I do have to wonder if if this Breakout by gold it's move gold is up another 1% today again I know no one cares about that right for a lot of us Gold's not an investment for a lot of people it's not an investment but it can be a signal to to to watch and so I do wonder if if gold breaking out is is signaling to the Fed that they need to start cutting um again that's kind of here we are guys we're at 68 it looks like we it looks like we just Wicked above it um so yeah there there it is right 69k so that is a new all-time high we have entered in through the door so I guess technically this is price discovery mode for Bitcoin we haven't been at 69k since November of 2021 um so I mean not quite three years right not quite three years but um guess two years and four months or so right so 26 months it took and and and and the fascinating thing about it right and we we we talked about this a lot is the reason you want to be Bitcoin heavy over over altcoin heavy at least in theory although many alts do out for Bitcoin but in theory the reason is because Bitcoin should hit new highs first right um and that's sort of the reason right and again like if you can if you if you time the altcoins at the bottom then that might not be true but you know if you're just dcing one thing Bitcoin tends to to be better right it tends to be better at least at least at that you know in in the phase of the cycle that we've been in right um so again just something to think about right something to think about but it does look like we did cross into a new all-time high we have now been rejected by about $1,000 so pretty sharp rejection on the first attempt we did Wick above it um we've talked about that I mean we we went through a lot of different indicators yesterday and talked about you know kind of where we are in terms of extension above certain key levels and and um and all that stuff so yeah I mean we're probably going to get a pullback at some point right I mean but and and I imagine that the thing to look for right the thing to look for when when it comes to these pullbacks is remember that so far all the pullbacks have been about 20% right so as long as it's only 20% Then You could argue the trend remains intact if it becomes more than that and really I mean 22% is okay but you know if if it becomes 25 or 30% then that could signal a reversal in the trend so just be be aware of that right a 20% drop from the current prices puts you at 55k 54 to 55k which is fascinating like you know the the argument is that you even if you were to drop to 55k that the trend is still theoretically intact but but if you drop beyond that that's where things could get a little bit dicey I still think there's a lot of you know there's there's definitely a lot of um Confluence over over many different metrics right now but we also know that when we are in Mania mode it's absolutely impossible to how high Bitcoin will go it's absolutely impossible I mean there's no way to know right absolutely no way to know um we sort of speculated yesterday on on some levels that you know that if we were to break to new all-time highs that could be hit um but again I I don't know right I don't know where it will Top out before a larger drop um we can go take a look at the extension from or let's go look at the short-term bubble risk now uh so we are currently extended from the the 20we estim about 53% so um still you know still a fairly I mean look it's not as extended as it was in 2021 or in 2019 or for that matter 2017 2013 2011 right so we're not as extended as any of those prior times right we know that but again the Counterpoint is that we should experience diminishing volatility from one Peak to another right whether the peak puts to new highs or not we should experience diminishing volatility from from one Peak to another and and again there's a a fairly interesting trend line when you look at at sort of the extension from the 20we SMA and you know we're we're getting pretty close right and and arguably you could say we tagged it if you if you sort of connect the dots like that but you know if you if you connect the dots like this and it implies sort of like the mid 70s right if you connect the dots like that a little bit less right a little bit less the mid 7s because that's 0. 51 it was when it was at 0. 53 that it would correspond to the mid 70s now remember that's a dynamic reference point I mean the 20we SME is constantly changing and so if you were to change the 20we moving average right I mean currently the 20we moving average is around 44367 but next week the 20we moving average could be $1,000 higher and then therefore the extension for the 20we SMA would be different go look at the vid there's a live stream that I did um here in January of 2021 when we hit it when we hit that level and what's what's interesting is is when we hit that level Bitcoin was only at 42k right so it hit that level it got a substantial pullback and then it hit it again right it hit it again but it was at a higher price because 2 gu had moved higher so um but yeah there there's a live stream that we did back over there in in early 2021 and we were talking about sort of the extension from the 20we moving average um and and we're not that far away from it I mean and again it depends on how you how you want to sort of fit it there I mean by some measures we're already there um by others there's a little bit more wiggle room to go um I did want to I did want to pull up the the fear and greed IND right so and again this is this is one of those metrics it's it's it's a bit handwavy um kind of like all of them if we're being honest but it's a bit handwavy and I I wanted us to sort of look at this and and and the fear ingredient next right now is at 90 right so what I want to do is I want to visualize anytime the fear and greed index is in the 90 to 100 Zone and unfortunately we don't have a lot of data um it only goes back to the to the last two you know the last few Peaks and you know in 2019 when we hit we we hit 95 and then that marked a local high and so in 2019 it was very fleeting right we hit it we hit 95 on the fear and greed and that was it in 2020 right we were in the 90s to 100 from November through February and yes we did go we did inch a little bit higher after February but you know had you sold your Bitcoin right at like 58k 55 58k back then I don't think you would have been disappointed you know just a few months later um but what you will see is that we stayed in the 90 to 100 phase for a while before it actually um before we actually saw a larger drop so again it's it's one of those things where it there there's two great examples of of what could go wrong if you only assume that one has to play out right if you only assume that 2019 has to play out then what happens if it ends up being this 202 20 2021 rally but if you only assume that this one has to play out what happens if it happen you know if it ends up being the 2019 rally um and again I've you know you can easily find combinations of both I I don't think there's a clear I think again when people ask is it 2019 or 2021 I think the answer is is 2024 um but yeah I think that when you look at you know when you look at at it I mean it could be a combination of both because there's elements of both right there's the ele element of 2020 where we have you know where we've put in a new all-time high right there's that element so in that way you could argue that it's more like 2020 but in other ways right in other ways you could argue that it's you know High rates and QT and gold breaking out like 2019 right like gold was breaking out in 2019 you had QT you had it was right before a Fed pivot so in that way it's kind of like 2019 but in terms of the new alltime high you know the spot ETF stuff the having coming up you could argue that that and again it could be it very well could just be a mixture of of both potential outcomes right where it doesn't look like 2019 it also doesn't look like 2020 remember the Market's got to keep this on our toes and it's not going to be obvious right it's likely not going to be obvious the way that it's going to play out um and and again I mean there there are times actually in history where you go up to all-time highs and you you sweep the high right you sweep it and then you do get a large pullback before then going up even higher and that pullback was about a 33% drop in 2017 right it was a 33% drop after sweeping the High um so that's another example to look at but we don't have the fear and greed index for back then um there's I mean there's obviously other things that we could look at but I mean I think you guys you guys know where we are generally speaking um and yes there's a lot of altcoins that are up today on their Bitcoin pairs right there's no doubt about it I imagine the dominance has taken a big hit it has it's all the way down at at at 54.6 so do I mean it's still up on the week right so I know it doesn't feel like it but it's still up on the week but but down on the day um and so again the sort of the implication that we've talked about many times is that um that liquidity from alt will will likely go back over to bitcoin and yes there's been a lot of great a lot of great altcoin rallies right like look at total 3 minus USD divided by Bitcoin right I mean even today where altcoins are up against Bitcoin they're still down on the week you know and I still look at this and think like it it seems it seems like we are going to slowly bleed back down to that range low now back over here it took 41 weeks to break the range low right so from from when we set the low so when we broke through it was 41 weeks from here to the current time we're currently on week you know 3637 I I I have to get it exact to know but if you take it from from that Wick there to to where we currently are it's been about 36 weeks if you take it from when we first got into these lows it's 37 weeks but again you know if that's the case then it implies that it could still take some time for all Bitcoin pairs to break down um and again we know that what what historically happens is that Bitcoin breaks those altcoins down on a Bitcoin rally it's the whole the whole dominance metric of Bitcoin that we've been tracking forever that it it breaks these it breaks them down on rallies and the reason is because they they just can't keep up right like they they can't keep Pace with Bitcoin and therefore they they break down on their Bitcoin pairs below support because Bitcoin is is fundamentally the better asset and and when you're you know when you are in in times of uncertainty a high uncertainty like we are today people tend to you know they tend to Veer towards the the the the lower risk assets um and that's why liquidity just kind of makes its way back over to bitcoin and and also too like when Bitcoin goes parabolic people don't like missing out on that and so they'll a lot of times what happens they'll convert their alts to bitcoin and exchange in the hopes of of um of of chasing that Bitcoin rally because what what people really want to do what people really want to do is they want to convert their Bitcoin to altcoins and and ride a theoretical alt season right that's what people really want to do is they want to ride a theoretical all season but the danger is that Bitcoin continues to to sort of leave the altcoins behind so people convert their Bitcoin to alts and then they look back at Bitcoin like oh crap bitcoin's not done and then they just go right back to bitcoin right because as long as Bitcoin maintains momentum it will take back control from the altcoin market right it's only when it really loses momentum that you know that that altcoins can can can start to to perform and that's assuming that it's it's like a you know sort of like a 2020 2021 run and not like the 2019 so um those are you know that's what I I think is worthwhile to think about and you know I mean again like some of these altcoins are doing well I'm not saying they're not I mean you know you have a lot of them right are are putting in new local highs right I mean you have um I mean even ether I mean ethereum's above 3,800 um even Doge Shana um uni xrp right they're all up today right adaa madic is down today madic is is one of those ones that it it it really is trying to so it's really try this is the problem when these alts get to their range lows right they're really trying to hold on but but they're struggling to do it right they're struggling to to hold on and and that's why maybe that one is is is under a bit more pressure is is because it's actually at the range lows and and actually it's below the range lows right um a lot of these other alts they're not there yet like adaa Bitcoin it's not at the range lows right dot Bitcoin still not there right ax Bitcoin it's still still not at the range lows but when when when some of them get down to those lows not saying they can't bounce but it's just that you know if they lose support then then they have to go into price discovery mode to the downside where then they have to figure out what's the next support level so that's the you know that's what I I think about when it comes to those those all Bitcoin pairs um but yeah I mean so right now Bitcoin is at 68k if you're just now joining us we did break to a new all-time high um we went to 69,1 156 at least here on the index um and again while Bitcoins at a new high most altcoins are not right and that's the reason right that's the reason for for rioting the Bitcoin dominance rally right that's the whole idea is is to to not to not fade Bitcoin in favor of of the thousands of different altcoins but if you want to diversify into altcoins it's okay but what I would say is is you know you always want to make sure that you're the ones that you're getting are are at least holding up on their Bitcoin pairs um if they're holding up on their Bitcoin pairs then maybe you can justify the risk if they're leading on their Bitcoin Pairs and they just keep on putting in new lows every few months then you would want to reconsider that and say well you know two years from now is it more likely that Bitcoin is going to be doing better than this altcoin right or even a year from now you know where would you rather have your money and most cases in most cases Bitcoin tends to be the winning answer sometimes sometimes the altcoin ends up being the winning answer but most cases Bitcoin does um and that's kind of the the whole premise behind the dominance ra and again you know as as as we get closer and closer to the having I I do think dominance will break I think it will I know today it looks pretty bad um you know with it with it dropping like this but I do think that we will see it break out right I really do I I know it's I know you could even look at this and and argue that it looks like a distribution pattern I get it I mean I'm not completely UNP unsympathetic to that idea to be completely honest but from a fundamental point of view it it seems like Bitcoin should still hold the re for at least another at least another month or two right because in order for the those in order for those altcoins to break down collectively on their Bitcoin pairs Bitcoin dominance has to break out and the idea is that the FED will stay higher for longer until they've really brought the degens back down to earth a little bit you know and and you know while Bitcoin I think is is fundamentally sound and and is is going to stand the test of time a lot of altcoins won't you know and and so um I I I do I really do believe that dominance will break out right and and the breakout the breakout point is is 55.3 so it's a little over a percent from where we currently are so if you see dominance at at 55.3 and especially at 56% right at 56% it's clear that altcoins have broken down on their Bitcoin pairs but at at at 5 at 55.3% altcoins should be broken down on on their Bitcoin pairs um and it should I mean normally as you can see it happens as Bitcoin rallies right it's it's those Bitcoin rallies that that break the all support and we looked at the 2016 um analog and and it took it was funny because it Bitcoin hit about 740 before eth broke down right and it's kind of funny because 740 if you just multiply that by 100x 74k I'm like is that what it's going to take to break eth down do we have to see you know mid 70s uh Bitcoin to break e Bitcoin down it's possible um it's certainly possible um there's you know I I I put out you know I I I put out a a message in um in ITC premium when we started the year and um and what I said what I said in the message was that we will remain risk on until Bitcoin dominance hits approximately 56% once we get to 56% I think I will have to reassess kind of where everything is is gold still breaking out what does the labor market look like you know um where where are all Bitcoin pairs if all Bitcoin pairs still haven't broken down at at 56% miraculously then then you know maybe there's something there but if you know if you're if you're hanging out and and E Bitcoin is breaking down at at 56% dominance which is where I said I think it would break down at you know it should be broken down by the time dominance is at 56% right e Bitcoin should be below 049 durably at 56% dominance so if that is the case at 56% dominance if you have e Bitcoin off support and you have all Bitcoin pairs off support and you have gold breaking out and the fear and grade indexes in the mid 90s like you know I mean it's a case could be made right a case could certainly be made that um that we we you know we would be due for for a pullback but um until that time right until that time um you know the um I imagine people keep their their their party hats on if we go take a look at the stock market um the S&P is actually down quite a bit today um the nasdaq's down about a 1 and a half% the russle down about 05% or so so this is actually a really important week so again I know everyone is is is loving is loving this and you know the the issue is that when you're at lows when when you're in the dumps you can never imagine going up again when you're at highs you can never imic going down again um but let's just remember that the Confluence we've talked about for for a year and a half is happening right it's all happening um and now that it's happening it's almost like we don't believe it right it's kind of crazy right now that the Confluence that we've been like discussing for how long it's almost like we don't believe it and and the reason is because of all the spot ETF stuff right I mean you know and and and all those news articles that are coming out right and kind of giving the the the the idea you know the people giving people the idea that that it's up only forever but again there the Confluence is there if you want to see it um but it can take weeks to months to play out as we saw in 2021 and even in 2019 I mean you know while the top occurred we still hung out at the highs four months before it was obvious in 2021 we kept going up for months before it was obvious right so that's what makes you know that's what makes it so difficult is that even even once you do get to the point where it turns around it's not obvious until months later right when you take a step back um ethereum is is at 30 you know it it's actually gone up to 3827 um so pretty big move by eth there um the other ones I mean ethereum is is certainly closer to all-time highs than than these other cryptocurrencies right I mean that would be a brutal way for the market to go if Bitcoin hit new highs and and really none of the altcoins did um before you had a larger pullback that would certainly be brutal um but we'll see where it goes and also there's a lot of uh labor market data coming in this weekend and again the labor market moves relatively slow um but I would keep an eye on it right I mean I would certainly keep an eye on it we should have basically Wednesday Thursday and Friday it'll just be you know back to backto back labor market data stuff right you employment rate non-farm payroll uh job openings job quits job hires ADP employment you know the household survey the The Establishment survey right we're going to be getting a lot of stuff over the next few days and and again I think that it's really interesting how how crypto is breaking you know how how Bitcoin is showing this much strength and and and and so too a lot of altcoins have at the same time the S&P is not but again that's there there there's some there's some cherry picking going on with that state because S&P is still doing largely pretty well right I mean yes today it's down but it's still largely doing pretty well um for a while here right I'm I'm guessing we could connect these dots and and argue that it's getting somewhat extended but I mean even Bitcoin you had connected dots that it eventually broke out from um I my my interpretation of gold here is that it's telling the Fed that they need to cut that's my interpretation of it is that gold is telling the FED that they should have started cutting yesterday and they're not going they're likely not going to cut in March um because inflation is still too high you know is as much as I I would I would like for it to be down right I I would really prefer I really don't like going to the store and spending $300 every time I go you know um but how can they cut you know how can they when you have you know when you have inflation still at 3% how can they cut but I think gold I I think gold is telling them that they need to cut gold I mean normally when gold breaks out like this from these range highs you know what it means it it it means that we're not that far away from a pivot is what it historically has meant I mean if you don't believe me I mean just look at over here right I mean when gold broke out in June of 2019 fed pivoted the following month liter I mean legitimately when it broke out right here the fed pivoted the following month right that's why I'm saying gold you know as far as for crypto investors right as far as crypto investors are concerned right no one here would would give a flying you know what if gold went to $3,000 right no one would care right no one in this in this chat room would literally care if if if gold went to 3K right because it took you know a decade to go from 2K to 3K so no one would care so I'm not asking you to look at gold um in that light what I'm saying is is look at it as a signal as a signal and when it broke out over here it was a signal that cuts were coming it was a signal that cuts were coming and by the way the S&P still climbed for several months after gold broke out it's not like it's not like gold breaking out spelled disaster for the S&P when it broke out back then but it did signal that cuts were coming and then the time before that it broke out was in was here in 2008 and in that case gold broke out actually after Cuts had already arrived and you know what the implication of that was in my mind is that when gold broke out here it was telling the FED that hey yes we see that you started to cut but you haven't cut nearly enough right you haven't cut nearly enough for you know to stop this gold train and then you can see that fed ended up cutting a lot more so I I'm asking you know when you when you think about gold I would I would view it more as a signal than anything else and and again right now it it is showing that it's looking like it wants to break out it could I mean it looks like it's already broken out that could that could change certainly um but that's that's what's going on right see there's a lot there's definitely a lot of things to consider a lot of different Confluence right to think about um over the next few few weeks and months and um my guess as I as I said yesterday like my guess is we're we're reaching some type of Crescendo as we approach the having we'll then cool off you know you know following the having and then the sort of the next debate that'll take place over the following you know let's call it six months will simply be was that it or will we get another right that's kind of what I think is going to happen is is we get our first top you know sometime I don't know right sometime around the having plus or minus a month there I mean it could be now right it could be four weeks from now could even be after right but I do think we're going to see the market cool off later this year and then we'll we'll basically have to figure out was that it or or will we get another surge you know and and at least the last several Cycles we always had another surge in in the post having year um we'll see you know we'll see what happens this time but that that is kind of uh it's kind of where we are right now so if we were to go take a look at at a few other things so the summary risk is at 516 social risk is at 315 the social risk is is still it it hasn't taken out the the highs yet this year right so again it it kind of the implication is that there's still it seems like it very well could right I'm not implying that it won't um but there's still some you know there's still nowhere near the same amount of retail that we had back over here in 2021 which is kind of fascinating considering the bitcoin's at new highs right when you think about where Bitcoin is and how you know a lot of Twitter accounts and YouTube channels are averaging in order of magnitude less activity than they were back then it's kind of eye openening I think the implication is is well is it going to go back to like it was in 2021 or will it not um I think that's kind of where we are right now but yeah the social risk right now is at 315 um um you can look at the altcoin season index it's currently at 75.5 one so my view and I've stated this many times is that while it can Wick into this area it'll likely these Wicks will likely get rejected because Bitcoin should regain control until after the FED pivots is my guess right that bit Bitcoin should remain in control durably until after that doesn't mean you can't get a couple weeks here and there where alts surge we're seeing that today I even even on the day that Bitcoin put in a new high dominance is still only at 54% so you're you're definitely seeing times I mean look at this like Theta Bitcoin is up 20 I don't know what the hell it's doing but it's up 28% today um so you certainly you know you certainly will see things like this you know some altcoins will rally um most will not and and and most will will likely bleed back to bitcoin even e Bitcoin is actually up a decent amount today it's it's up about 6% it's back up to 056 so but again eth eth Bitcoin is the strongest out of all the altcoins right it if it's gonna fall to bitcoin it's probably going to do it after the altcoins fall to it right because altcoins in general are not as competitive with Bitcoin as ethereum is so if eth is going to fall against Bitcoin I imagine it would happen after altcoins fall if you look last cycle in fact altcoins fell to bitcoin the week of June 24th and that's actually what marked the local top but eth did not fall to bitcoin until two weeks later right it took another two weeks for ethereum to see that same drop below the range lows in a durable fashion right it didn't occur until the week of July 8th um so it it took a little bit more time and so that's kind of the argument is that yeah like ethereum will likely show some resilience relative to the altcoin market and and that's one of the reasons why you know even today um ethereum dominance is up right I mean if the ethereum dominance is up altcoins are still bleeding not only to bitcoin but they also bleed to e it's just that while altcoins bleed to eth eth has been bleeding to bitcoin so I don't spend too much of my mental energy or YouTube videos talking about how alt coins are bleeding to eth but they are the reason I don't spend so much mental energy talking about it is because eth is bleeding to bitcoin right and if and if and if eth is bleeding to bitcoin I don't really care if alts are bleeding to eth because if if if alts are bleeding to eth and eth is bleeding to bitcoin then alts are bleeding to bitcoin right so that's why I don't really spend a lot of time talking about it I mean like look at look at eth you know it is you know it's still it hasn't broken out of this downtrend right um Soul eth was one that was actually a bit stronger but is it you know is it just kind of back up to the Range High only to fall back down you know is it like is it is it just kind of repeating this pattern here where you like put in a top and then you put in a lower high right and then you just kind of keep on you just kind of keep on going down as as as it keeps bleeding back to eth you know is that what's happening it's it's possible Right dot e yeah I mean it's I mean it's down from the highs do is down 76% against eth right so I mean and I get a lot of these altcoins that I know everyone's making videos on and and and talking about but I mean look I even Al Garand Al Garand is down 97 you know 97% against e and if it's down 97% against e guess how much do down against Bitcoin 99% right n ALR is down 99% against Bitcoin so like think about anyone that's DC ALR for the last four years for the last four and a half years I mean like you've just been bleeding to bitcoin when I first joined crypto I didn't want to believe this stuff like I really didn't I I was I was um I guess more naive right I was more naive like I I I thought that that these altcoins would hold water against Bitcoin over the longer Hall and I was proven cycle after cycle after cycle that that's just not true they bleed back to bitcoin over a long enough period of time and so you can make a lot of money in the altcoin market if you play your cards right right if you play your cards right you can make a lot of money in the altcoin market when you're in a Bitcoin dominance downtrend right where you where you and and when I say make a lot of money I mean relative to your Satoshi valuation I I don't really care that much about the USD valuation I'm valuing it in Satoshi right in its Bitcoin valuation because Bitcoin is like the standard that you're comparing to right as opposed to the US dollar so the idea is if you're if you're going to go buy an altcoin and and you're just looking at it and you're like oh like you know now it's going to finally bottom and then six months later it just keeps on going down you have to ask yourself at what point do you come to the same conclusion that altcoins bleed to bitcoin over a long enough period of time so what is the lesson in all that does it mean you never have alts no right if you you know if you play your cards right you can make a lot of money on alt coins but the lesson is that you take profits back to bitcoin right because if you don't this is what will come for you right this is what will come for you dash Bitcoin and guys you know if you look at Dash Bitcoin it did the same thing right I mean like you know it did the same type of bounce off the range lows right and then it it still ultimately faded down right so this will eventually come for you and I know the Counterpoint to all that is well you're looking at at dinosaur coins right you're looking at the dinos why don't you look at some of the new flashy stuff that's great you can make money on that but the new flashy stuff are going to be the dino coins of next cycle right so that's my point is that yes in their first cycle in an ALT coin's first cycle it can outperform Bitcoin a lot of times the the the the altcoins that outperform Bitcoin even in a Bitcoin dominance uptrend are the coins that were only created that year right before you know in the coins that have all the bare Market baggage they tend to not do as well the newer coins can do well against Bitcoin in a Bitcoin dominance uptrend right we know that but those coins that do well against Bitcoin in a Bitcoin dominance uptrend they eventually become the dinosaur coins in the following cycle right so the whole idea with altcoins is that you can make money on them but you want to you know ideally you you take profits back to bitcoin because if you don't what's going to happen is that altcoin will eventually just become a macro beder right that's kind of the idea okay but anyways right now Bitcoin is I mean it it it ran the highs we we're now down at 67k uh dominance is still down on the day um we're at 53.86 per. so it's it's funny because I'm as I'm talking about all this stuff like like simultaneously as I talk about it alts are surging against Bitcoin but again I'm not I'm not saying they can't you know see these little surges right they they certainly can and they have over the last several weeks we've had plenty of surges um by all Bitcoin pairs but the general Trend right the general trend has been to sort of just slowly fade back to the downside as as liquidity flows back to the king um so yeah yeah I mean they're up on the day they're still down on the week all Bitcoin pairs are down about 1.6% this week um if you include eth it's actually up about 0.25% eth has had a pretty good showing so far this week but again that kind of goes back to the idea of eth will hold up better than altcoins for longer but eventually it too should fall against it's Bitcoin um I guess that's I mean I don't I don't I mean you guys know my thoughts I don't really know what else to say we already hit we already hit new alltime high so I don't know what I'm doing here um the first time you hit it is kind of where the uh you know sort of the excitement is if you hit it again it's like well okay we already hit it right so we did hit new alltime highs so we at least can can know that that that has happened so for the first time ever Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high before the having right so this High over here was around 69k and we just went to 69.1k 69.2k probably is going to depend on the exchange you're looking at but we did run the highs um and the question is is can we you know can we continue to go higher keep an eye on altcoins and and keep an eye on that liquidity in the altcoin market and and see where that goes watch the labor market data over the next few days and see where that comes in and and and and honestly you know keep an eye on gold right keep an eye on gold if it continues to break out it could be telling the FED they need to Pivot right that they we need QE and normally gold rallies when the QE you know when the QE arrives right gold will it can sell off initially but then it'll it should continue to Rally so keep an eye on gold it looks like it's breaking out all Bitcoin pairs the number to look for is 39 when you look at total 3 minus USC Bitcoin coin dominance 55.3% is the breakout Point 56% for good measure eth Bitcoin 049 again we're we we could very well be weeks away from all of that stuff right weeks away and given the fact that eth Bitcoin is surging right now it's up about 7% right given that fact I mean for for E Bitcoin what it ends up usually being is the stairs up or sorry the elevator up and the stairs down right so it'll it'll get these surges and then then just sort of slowly come back down right so this stuff can take weeks to play out right it can absolutely take weeks so make sure we we're aware of that um and also maybe just keep an eye on the fear and greed and see you know what it's doing um it's it's currently at 90 and the excitement is in the air right the excitement is definitely in the air last week we were at 79 yesterday we were 82 today we're at 90 we'll see where we come in at the end of the day I mean I don't know sometimes it seems like it should go up but then it actually goes down like if there's a sell off before the the day you might actually see the fair and green index back in the 80s or something before the day is over or maybe even lower you know if if we end up you know like if Bitcoin ends up closing the day at like you know at a lower valuation than alltime highs right if it closes the day at like 66k or 65 or 67 right then you might actually see the fair and greed and expect down some um so it kind of depends there was there was a day last week where it surged into the 80 it it went to 82 and then it was the following day it was at a higher price but the fearing GRE index came in low lower because sometime during the day there was a pretty big selloff even though Bitcoin reclaimed that level there was a pretty big selloff um so yeah and yeah I don't know the the the nasdaq's down about 2% today the Russell isn't down as much right the Russell is only down about 045 you actually see so there's kind of a similarity there right the Russell is only down half a percent the nasdaq's down 2% altcoins today are up 1% whereas Bitcoin is down 2% so what do you notice you're seeing the frothier stuff surge today right so altcoins are surging against Bitcoin um the Russell is surging against the NASDAQ is are are all EVS surging against Tesla that' be interesting to take a look at I don't know um they are Tesla's down four and a half % lucid and rivan are only down to 3% so we're kind of seeing it across the board today so while I'm lecturing you on why altcoins should bleed to to bitcoin we're actually seeing them go up right now but again the the the the lecture is not based on a daily a daily time frame it's based on a macro Trend that's been taking place for two and a half years right for two and a half years this trend has been taking place so remember right I mean that is is is is where we are right now is is yes today is the day that the altcoins are celebrating against Bitcoin but they should still bleed back to the king and and again I I think the the the stuff to watch for for the rest of the week Beyond the price of Bitcoin which is what obviously everyone's going to be watching keep an eye on gold keep an eye on the labor market data you know if you guys like these live streams maybe I can do them more frequently I haven't done them in a while um but I mean if you guys like them I can I can try to do them a little bit more frequently um but yeah do you guys have any any any um questions you'd like me to talk about could you look at eth Bitcoin yeah we can I mean you know it is surging today I'm not going to pretend like it's not it's right there on the chart um and I don't really know I mean like you know I look at it and I I still think it'll break down I really do I I really do think that's the ultimate outcome I think it'll break down um but that doesn't preclude it from you know challenging that belief for weeks before it does right I mean I mean look I don't again like I I I've I've literally never bought Theta in my life right I've never bought it I really don't care what it does but I mean you know it's it's surging here on its Bitcoin pair so I don't want to I don't want to completely say that eth can't you know can't find some strength against Bitcoin in the short term but I still do think it will bleed back down whatever ever comes next it's my guess right it's my guess but I I could be wrong what are those indexes called the alt stuff so there's um there's to so yeah if you're not familiar to there's total market cap there's total market cap which is everything there's total two which is everything besides Bitcoin there's total three which is everything besides Bitcoin and eth there's others which is everything outside of the top 10 so you know the the stuff beyond the top 10 the things I was looking at I was looking at total three minus usdt divided by Bitcoin so I was taking the altcoin market so it doesn't include Bitcoin and E I was subtracting out usct and then dividing all that by Bitcoin you could also subtract out usdc if you want to as well right so we can do that if you guys want is it's just more or less a rounding era which is why I don't do it and also usdc doesn't have as much price history but it's kind of doing the same thing right I mean like it's it's it's basically at these you know it's trying to hold these range lows right um and so that's why and again you can see that it doesn't really have as much data so I can't even I I can't really go any any further out to see kind of what it was doing but it's at these range lows it's been trying to hold that's the question is does It ultimately break and I think it will right I mean it it broke over here and whatever you know there there were some lows over here if the if the data actually existed on the chart um because we know that it does for usct right where it broke down right there right and and here then it broke down eventually so I'm guessing I'm guessing that it will eventually fall below this by the way remember it took 41 weeks last time so if it takes 41 weeks this time it could still be weeks away because we're at like 36 to 37 weeks at this point and then there's also total two minus USD divided by Bitcoin so this includes eth same idea right I mean kind of the same same general idea that you are you know you're hugging the range lows um and that eventually it breaks and and and what causes it not to keep breaking theoretically speaking although there's not a lot of data points so it's fre you to call me out on that right but at least last time it stopped breaking really once you saw the FED go back to QE right and because we haven't gone back to QE yet I still think that all Bitcoin pairs will eventually break down to you know alt alt liquidity will flow back to bitcoin is is the Assumption it could happen on a Bitcoin rally that's what it normally does it could also happen on a Bitcoin dump um this here this this breakdown right there occurred on a Bitcoin dump actually right so you you can't even definitively say that it has to occur on a Bitcoin rally like there are examples where it all broke down against Bitcoin on a Bitcoin dump right here's another example um uh where was it now I guess that's not I mean this this example here I believe Bitcoin was going up then right wasn't it um so they broke down right there so actually they broke down yeah was sort of on a Bitcoin rally but then after they broke down they just continue to break down right even after Bitcoin cooled off right so yeah I mean you could certainly see something like that play out again oh USD dominant someone's asking for a so us DT dominance is um is an interesting metric as well to track because it has been a pretty good indicator of of where things turn around all these prior areas on this chart marked were came just before 50% drops but the the issue with this trend line is that it's it's very easy to sort of manipulate like I could bring it down here and it doesn't really change anything right you could still argue that we tagged the trend line and then argue that we still have more room to go so I I would keep an eye on the USD dominance we are getting in by by the way if you think this is just we talked about this we did a video on it when it was right here and I said guys if we get rejected here and Bitcoin only drops 20% and then starts to go on a rally into the having then the the thing to look for will be if the USD dominance drops to around 4% and we are at 4% I mean it you know it could go a little bit lower for sure but we are nearing that level right we are nearing that level it's at 4.08% the trend line sits at at at around 4% plus or minus a few ten so something to watch someone says sometime soon we'll probably see a correction to the bullmark worb around 40 to 50K Bitcoin dominance will then top out after the correction then money will flow into altcoin Market as Bitcoin dominance drops that's possible right it's possible um you the the uh the the bullmark sport band for Bitcoin right now is currently uh ranging from 44.3 to 45.3 so it's a big drop you know and you know to get to that level um my concern with the with the bullmark swan is that when you go this long without testing it history shows that you don't hold it now maybe we hold it this time I'm not I don't want to get into trouble with you guys more more than I already have but history you know history would would suggest that you really need to check you know you really need to check in with it every few months um to hold it right and and if you don't and you get something like this where you go you know six months then the likelihood of holding it is not as high and we're currently at 20 weeks right the end of 2017 we hit um you know from the last test in 2017 to when we actually then came back down to it about 20 weeks right 2019 here to the test of it was about 22 weeks right so we are already at the point where it's kind of the argument is right like that no matter what Bitcoin does whether it goes up to 70 or not you you might argue that it's too far gone to hold the 20we SMA as support whenever it decides to test it I mean it could test it next week maybe it doesn't test it till May right maybe we have to wait until after the having for it to test it and perhaps when it tests it the 20we SMA is much higher you know maybe it's at 50k at that time um you can see that when we tested the 20we SME over here in 2021 the 20we SMA was at 40 7K right now the 2 week estim is only at 44k right so again you know there's certainly an argument to be made that that is kind of going to be the next story is when we do come back down to it do we have enough strength to hold it us support right do the spot ETF flows continue sufficiently to keep Bitcoin above its 20we moving average and in in Risk on environment if it if not then you might go risk off right and that's why I'm saying in order to get insight into that in order to get and maybe see the most likely outcome keep an eye on gold and keep an eye on the labor market if gold you know if gold pulls back and doesn't sustain this breakout then it could end up just being a false breakout like we had back over here and then the party continues for a while right but if it sustains this breakout and it's more durable than the one that we had back in December then that might raise a few eyebrows I would also keep an eye on oil because you know one of the things with with oil is that if keeps going up it might exacerbate the problem with inflation and and sort of drag it on longer and longer and longer and and cause more and more rate cuts to get priced out if if inflation is not derly going back to the Target that the FED has set at 2% so that I mean again it's not really that elevated I mean it's still only at 79 we were at you know we were at 95 back in September so still well off those Highs but just keep an eye on it um go see if it breaks out or see if it's a fake out and then all Bitcoin pairs right obviously keep an eye on all Bitcoin pairs is the RIS magic that you developed all of us also available for stocks we have it for the S&P um and I think we have it for like Tesla we don't have it for a lot of stocks at this point I mean I guess the reason is because I don't tend to buy individual stocks I have bought some um but I don't tend to buy them so I'm not that interested and I guess the the website here reflects my interest uh unfortunately I I trying to change that um but if you do pull up the the risk on the S&P 500 this is on the daily it takes a lot of load it's like a hundred years of data that we're we're having to load in here um and um yeah you can see that the risk on the S&P is at is at 0825 the thing I like about the risk metric is that it it I don't have to worry about anything else is I just look at it and say where you know where were we previously and the thing with the S&P risk is that it can stay elevated a lot longer than Bitcoin risk can that's what that's what I've learned throughout all my years tracking it is that it can stay higher risk for longer than Bitcoin um it's kind of strange right but it can it can ride those high risk levels for for months um before showing any weakness um but yeah we're right now we're at 0825 risk it looks like the highest we've gone is 0865 the last time we were at 0 865 risk was you know back over here in in sort of mid to late 2021 um and sort of drawing a line across the screen you can see that there's been a few times in history we've we've hit these risk levels right I mean the S&P is definitely extended I mean no one's trying to deny that it's been one a hell of a rally and who knows where it's going to stop some of these rallies by the S&P extended even higher right I mean the uh the rally over here in 1997 the the risk levels went even much higher and the S&P continued to climb the wall of wory for years before It ultimately came back down meta having issues let's go check in with meta and see what's going on it's down about 2% so the thing I talked a little about this yesterday but I will reer reiterate when you think about the Magnificent 7 right um you know some of them have been slowly falling off right Tesla was the first to fall off then you had um I want to say Google I want to say Google I don't know if that's true but that's what I want to say yeah it looks like it looks like Google fell off right we were we were in this pattern before right and you can see it was on the third attempt we finally broke back up Google has fallen off Tesla has fallen off Apple has fallen off from the returns that the Magnificent 7even are giving right so you still have right you still have um the you still have Nvidia right you still have Nvidia you still have Microsoft and if you go check in by the way with um with Microsoft let me see let me pull it up I'm trying to figure out um Microsoft has still been doing better than a lot of the other ones but today it's down um you have Amazon right so we have Microsoft Apple Nvidia Tesla alphabet meta and Amazon so Tesla's fallen out off Apple has fallen off and Google has falling off Amazon yes it's down this week but it still hasn't really definitively fallen off yet I mean it doesn't look like apple right it doesn't look like apple um Amazon has not yet Nvidia has not yet and um meta has not yet right so and Microsoft right Microsoft so I think like you know when you think about the Magnificent 7 and and and when you go back to Prior times like the nifty50 or you know prior times where there was concentration in the market it usually is when the last one Falls right and again that that could be Nvidia this time um and and maybe that's the one that holds up the longest but um I would uh keep an eye on that how much impact do you think the ETF inflows have on the price of Bitcoin I I mean I think they certainly have an impact I'm not I'm not going to say that they don't um we can actually go look at some of the so we have some of it on the website here so um let me just go to the um we just added it um fairly fairly recently so I'm trying to remember where where we put it so here's the funds overview for these spot ETFs and if you click on one right like if you click on the I shares Bitcoin trust you can see the Holdings right so the Holdings have been going up um if we go back and look at here you can see kind of which ones are outperforming um so yeah I mean certainly they've had some effect right I mean they definitely had some effect I do wonder you know if they're having a good effect now at some point I wonder you know the people buying the spot ETFs are are not going to they probably not going to be your diamond hands people right I mean the the people watching this video are are are probably the most you know I'm guessing the people watching this video are more likely to own their own keys but there's going to be a lot of people out there that are they're not going to be sort of Die Hard right they're just doing it to make money which is secretly what all you guys are here for as well but we we'll at least pretend otherwise um I think that yeah like certainly they they have an effect um but you know I mean look when when QQQ launched in at the end of the dotc era it rallied for like a year right it rallied for a year and it's funny because when it when it launched it launched at like 48 which is funny because Bitcoin when Bitcoin spotf launched it launched it um like 48k right and what what this did is it went from like 48 all the way up to 120 120 and then it went down to 20 I think about how crazy that would be that'd be one hell of a move but I don't really think it's the best analog because uh for a number of reasons like you know I mean back over here unemployment rate was going down right right now unemployment rate seems like it's going up so I don't know if it's the best analog but maybe it is maybe it is a good analog and you know I I think it's worth kind kind of keeping in the back of your mind right like if if if six months from now it still seems like it's playing out like that then we you know it might be worthwhile to to to continue to follow that but um otherwise just kind of keep it in your back pocket someone says my God if QE happens so that sort of a danger with QE is that if it comes back too quickly it could lead to another round of inflation which I don't think anyone wants um but I do think we're probably closer than people think I'm not saying that it has to happen this month but the economy is weakening right I mean like bankruptcies are going up um all a lot of the excess in the labor market has been removed now right A lot of it has so at some point once that excess is fully gone which you could argue that it has been gone that's going to make its way over to the labor market um and then that'll be the next narrative that we have to F that we have to focus on and and when that narrative you think about like the inverted yield curve the sort of the the risk is on the other side of inversion we've said that forever right it's when it un inverts is where the risk materializes but the only way it's going to un invert is if the I well the main way that it would un invert is if there's some type of weakness and then everyone thinks that fed's actually going to Pivot but they haven't pivoted yet and until the labor market shows that weakness they probably won't P Cycle indicator AC cross yeah there it's no work it's not it's not close can I please show Bitcoin against M2 sure so here it is against M2 so you can see that it is pretty clearly at new highs right and it's you know it's still pretty high up because I mean again M2 went down so um that's why it's still kind of clearing the highs even though Bitcoin USD is off the highs now it's down about three $2 to $3,000 um did we hit the target of the two and a half down from the last Top Cycle we actually went to two which is kind of actually what we did last cycle Believe It or Not Right which is kind of funny because um if you look at if you look at the logarithmic regression bands the rainbow sorry not that one the rainbow I need to pull it up what's funny is is you remember last cycle when um when we so so from here to here was two and a half and then from here to here was two and a half and then from here to here was only two and I was like well is the model broken right all models are wrong right some are useful but is the model broken and what's interesting is that when the actual top came it ended up being two and a half log lines down right we just sort of we front ran the cycle a bit we front ran it and then we cooled off and then ended up being two and a half now the issue is that two and a half right two and a half from here puts you all the way down at this one that we've already passed right we've already passed it but have we just come into the to the sort of the two right so one two and then maybe we end up topping out at this one in a year and a half right you might say well Ben that makes absolutely no sense absolutely no sense none whatsoever because that's only at 50k but you have to remember that in a year and a half it'll be much higher than 50k right if you go take a look at where it would be in a year and a half right so it's it's this blue one so if you go all the way out to December of 2020 2025 it would be at 115k so I I really wonder if we're just front running it just like we did in 2021 and then we cool off for a while right so that's kind of what I would I would look at right is is are we just kind of front running it in the same way right in the same way um and and and so you know you could argue that the two and a half log line idea sort of fell by the wayside again but then does it end up being right in another year and a half right where you know maybe you fade back down you cool off for a while and then you eventually go back up to that same log line but when you go back up to it it's another 50k higher right so that's also possible as well right by the way here's a great example where Bitcoin USD has dropped another perc and dominance of Bitcoin has gone up right we saw it go from 53.8 up to 54 right so that's a great a great example of how you know this a great example of how you can see um alts bleed to bitcoin even when Bitcoin goes down right it it can happen I know people believe that it won't but it it can happen and it certainly can happen um I've seen it happen right I know I know it's I know it's possible um but it hasn't happened really in a while which is think why a lot of people don't believe that it will happen but again what I would look for I would look for for all Bitcoin pairs breaking down for E Bitcoin breaking down for gold breaking out the fear and greed index is already in the I mean look guys the reality is that Gold's already breaking out and the fear and greed X is already in the 90s so now confirmation of all that would be alt Bitcoin pairs breaking down and eth Bitcoin breaking down that would sort of give you confirmation of everything we've talked about for like the last year and a half and also usdt dominance is has has is basically at the trend line right so it's kind of like all that everything we've talked about for like a year and a half seems like it's coming into a crescendo and we're all just watching it happen right and and and and you know just seeing it play out and it almost seems surreal that it's even happening but here we are right it has been happening what is the social risk indicator at um 315 so 315 still not that different from 2019 right I mean again it could turn into something different but it is not that different from 2019 and and so I mean you can see that here social risk topped in earlier 2019 and then it actually ended up putting in a lower high where Bitcoin USD actually topped so I would keep an eye on this like does retail come back or do they not again I don't know they're not back yet not and look some retail is back right but they're not back in the same way they were here in 2021 that's what I mean they're not here like they were here in 2021 that's why I think that you could certainly have a a cool off phase you know for six months or something um before you know before sort of rekindling the flame can you show the E RIS metric sure um so here it is for eth so eth risk is actually higher than Bitcoin risk which is another reason why I think eth Bitcoin is going to bleed eth risk is at 747 747 so it is pretty extended doesn't mean it can't go higher but it is it is pretty extended well Bitcoin F if everything we talked about comes into play what would be your next move be so this is what I would look for okay again it's so hard to know exactly The Ordering of things but like if this trend line on usdt dominance ends up marking the top which hey maybe it does maybe we just get rejected at the all-time high right it's possible right it's certainly possible but if that happen happens if we see gold break out and if all Bitcoin pairs break down and if e Bitcoin breaks down and if the fear and greed index kind of hits those 90 levels which is that where we right now and then it sort of Fades back down what I would look for is first you would watch to see Bitcoin dominance top in a Bitcoin USD downtrend okay that is the key thing but here's where it gets interesting Bitcoin dominance should theoretically top in a Bitcoin USD downtrend that people don't think of as a downtrend right there it's too early to for people to even consider it to be a downtrend right so it tops in a Bitcoin USD downtrend sometime around a pivot to QE right that's what you would look for right dominance topping sometime around a Fed pivot plus or minus a month or so from there from from that point Bitcoin dominance I think would if it follows prior Cycles right if it follows prior Cycles as it comes back as as look if if if you're in the camp of Bitcoin only ever goes up like you're not going to like anything I say right you're frankly um but if if we can Envision a scenario in our future where Bitcoin goes down right if we can Envision that then in that scenario Bitcoin dominance should initially go up but if it follows the last cycle then Bitcoin dominance will Top at the same time that Bitcoin Falls below its 20we SMA right so I'll say that again Bitcoin dominance should theoretically potentially I again I'm not married to this idea right but it could theoretically top the same time that Bitcoin Falls below its 20we moving average but as Bitcoin grinds back down to the 20we moving average Bitcoin dominant should go up okay so I I I want to just be clear about that's what I would expect but it could it could come out different like it could be different but that's what I would expect based on my own experience is that Bitcoin dominance climbs as Bitcoin USD Falls and then when Bitcoin USD goes below the 20 week that's potentially where Bitcoin dominance tops and then the question will be um then you could get to the point where all Bitcoin pairs bottom out right and if we get to that point then then then the focus that I think people will care about will be alt USD pairs right as opposed to alt Bitcoin pairs but that's where things can get tricky so that is what I would expect based on the you know based on history um and and so that's what I will continue to sort of follow and you know I I I really think that if if Bitcoin dominance can break to to you know to to 56% I think that that we should be well on our way to 60% at that point right if if we can break about 55.3 go to 56 then I don't really think I I don't really think it's it's gonna stop there I mean I think it will go to 60 and I I think that that alt will bleed back to the king um even in even if Bitcoin goes down but that's the that's the beauty of the dominance Theory right I mean that's been the beauty of the dominance theory for the last two years is that no one knows how high Bitcoin is going to go if you want exposure to crypto you can get Bitcoin you know and and and you can be fairly confident if you believe in the dominance theory of dominance goes higher during QT and high rates that you have the soundest asset in the cryptoverse and so if we go up you have exposure to the upside and if Bitcoin crashes 50% it minimizes your downside risk because if Bitcoin crashes 50% altcoins are going to be in the gutter I mean they're going to be destroyed if Bitcoin were to see something like that so Bitcoin gives you the potential upside while minimizing your downside now at the current prices bitcoin's pretty I mean the risk level is pretty high right I'm not asking you to go YOLO in now um but that's the point right if if you you were dcing Bitcoin back in late 2022 early 2023 or altcoins Bitcoin has generally outperformed the altcoin market so I would say if Bitcoin dominance goes to 60% and then Bitcoin goes below its 20we moving average I think that at that point there is a strong case to be made that dominance could have topped at that point but I don't think the dominance top is in until the FED pivots and I don't think the FED pivots until the labor market shows weakness but I wonder I I have to wonder is gold telling us that the FED has gone too far I have to wonder right because every time right in recent history that gold has broken out of this range of a range that it's end whether you want to look at 2019 or 2008 it always has meant that rate Cuts were around you know that that rate Cuts were going to were coming in in this cycle we hadn't even had rate Cuts yet in the in the 2008 one we had already had a few rate Cuts but it wasn't nearly enough so I have to wonder if that is ultimately the outcome I think gold is sending a signal for those who want to listen but I can't possibly know how high Bitcoin is going to go before before there's a larger draw down right and until that happens um it's really hard to say I mean again like right now bitcoin's down 5% right but again I mean volatility as you get as you get into these phases volatility can be extremely extremely you know can you know turn your stomach right the amount of volatility that happens and that's why I say right you know when you're in a time like this you need to have a plan you need to have a plan that you developed a year ago so that you can stick to it now and not fall for any of the BS narratives that are coming your way right stick to your plan don't stick to oh I'm just going to wing it right you had a plan presumably that you thought of a year ago stick to that plan if you change it if you change it sort of impromptu then doesn't mean it can't work out but historically anytime I've changed my plan uh I've always wondered like why I changed it I'm like I should have just stuck with my plan is there a correlation between gold and Bitcoin well we do have a um uh correlation coefficients and we're going to go over to the uh Spearman coefficient the Spearman coefficient there's the Pearson and there's the Spearman the Spearman is nice because it doesn't assume a linear relationship so we're going to look at the Spearman co co correlation coefficient Matrix if you look at the spear the the Spearman correlation Co fish Matrix diversify right they're all correlated you know they're all correlated you know who cares if you have a basket of 20 different altcoins if they're they're all basically correlated let's switch it over instead of just looking at crypto let's look look at crypto stocks and metals if you look at crypto stocks and metals um I'm not really sure why we're getting an NA here on nickel it's probably because our you the provider or something is down or something at the moment but we'll get that worked out if you look at Bitcoin so here's Bitcoin and then we scroll all the way over to Gold the correlation is 0.14 right so that's not not a very strong correlation right it's not if you if you scroll down like it'll tell you right plus one is a strong positive correlation negative one is negative correlation um it it's not it's not very highly correlated right and we can even we can even add that in right we can look at at Bitcoin against gold right here so that's the correlation of Bitcoin to gold right not not very impressive or obvious here's the 365 day so over 365 days I guess it's correlated about 739 but I mean that makes sense because over the last year Bitcoin has gone up and so two is gold right and gold hasn't gone up as much but still gone up so they've been correlated when you think it might be a good time to accumulate eth I look I I'm not asking you to follow my my views on eth I I just think it's going to bleed against Bitcoin Co given enough time I I I would encourage you to to do what you think makes sense for you if you're a maxi like if you're an eth maxi then I I certainly don't expect you to wait until .03 to 0.4 in fact when we were at 0.049 I made a whole video and in that video I said relentlessly that people should be hedged in case eth Bitcoin does not break down to my target so if you if you really want eth again it's up to you I just think Bitcoin will outperform it whether Bitcoin goes up or down right that's my view is that it it outperforms it sorry I'm just looking at the comments um oh is meta down someone says meta is down worldwide is that true I don't know if it's true um I honestly have no idea but I'll take your word for it all of meta is down so how's how's the stock looking if it's down it's down one and a half percent the funny thing is if meta went down if if Facebook went down I have to imagine that like if you're if if you're my generation there's a good chance that none of us would even notice because I I think a lot of my generation like we started out on Facebook um and because Facebook came out like when we were you know like in in in middle school right it came out when I was I think I was in Middle School when it came out and then it was the cool thing right like back then it was Myspace and then everyone switched over from Myspace to to Facebook and um and it was like the cool thing for like three you know three or four years and then whenever when parents joined Facebook that's when it became uncool and then all the kids that originally signed up for it were like well no I don't want to be on Facebook if my parents are on Facebook it's not the cool thing anymore so then like I feel like a lot of people in my generation don't even use Facebook because it was the cool thing for a few years until everyone else got on it and then once everyone else got on it it became uncool um but and then everyone kind of migrated over to other platforms yeah at one point you're right it was like only college kids and they expanded it Beyond I mean I'm sure they don't regret expanding it I mean I'm sure they'd rather be raking in billions of dollars per year rather than being the cool platform you know I don't think anyone's blaming them for their decision I just think that a lot of people left um in my generation because it was the cool thing at first and then once the you know once our parents joined it became uncool yeah like there's like Facebook Marketplace and stuff yeah I I I I've never used I've never used Facebook Marketplace not once in my life and I don't intend on using it yeah I'm a millennial have I already talked about dominance of course what do I think about xrp well that's a loaded question I think that and I said that I put out a tweet tweet I have to be very careful about what I said about all coins because what happens is I put out a tweet about xrp dominance dropping and then like I got cited in three different news outlets as like enraging xrp holders but guys the whole thing was that a lot of xrp Maxis dunk on bitcoin dominance constantly right I mean how many times have you seen xrp people dunking on bitcoin dominance anytime it has a pullback over the last two years and then my my only retort to them was that if you're going to dunk on bitcoin dominance and then you're going to shill xrp relentlessly then how come you never pull up the xrp dominance chart which by the way has dropped from 31.7% to 1.4% right so don't you know don't if you're an xrp maxi right like be be fair right like don't just dunk on bitcoin dominance and say it's only ever going to go down and then go shill xrp for you know relentlessly to all your followers and then not acknowledge the elephant in the room that xrp dominance has dropped from 31% to 1.4% I'm not saying it can't ever Spike back up right I'm not saying that in fact it could I mean that's what it often does is it gets these big spikes back up but it hasn't been back up to the top of the range since 2017 and if you look at the xrp Bitcoin valuation you know I mean maybe it maybe it comes back down here to these lows and gets some type of a bounce I don't know but my point is that if you're going to dunk on bitcoin dominance show your altcoin dominance and then come to the same conclusion about Bitcoin dominance I doubt you will I think you would see that the Bitcoin dominance has stood the test of time and it's remained High um and most altcoin dominance just continues to go down because there's there's tens of thousands of altcoins right but there's only one Bitcoin How likely do you think it is for link to be a relic that's a good question um you know I have said I have if you've if you've caught wind of what I've said previously I've said a number of times that like my portfolio is 99% Bitcoin and then people always like well what's the other 1% um if you followed me last cycle you know right I mean I was very clear about which altcoins I had last cycle and and Link was one of them and I I sold basically what I did with link um what I did with link last cycle was I wrote it and then I sold link here and I sold it into Bitcoin right I did I did still have more link right I still rode more of it up I did plenty of videos on it but I sold a lot of my link to bitcoin right there and the reason was because the the risk level on link Bitcoin at the time hit one it actually hit Triple 1es where the link risk on its USD pair its Bitcoin pair and its e pair were all at one so I converted my link to bitcoin right there and I got really lucky because that marked the top on link Bitcoin I still had some link to ride the USD pair with but I did convert a lot of the link to bitcoin right there and then link Bitcoin has basically been down ever since now it was showing some sh like some strength for a little bit um and I was I was a little hopeful that it might break out but it didn't right I mean like it was it was just like another double top right it had a double top right there and then it just kind of did the same thing again you know so I I don't know I I really don't know it it every time that it's had the opportunity to break out against Bitcoin it just keeps on getting rejected so I I wanted and maybe we could take a look at the link eth valuation to maybe give us a little bit more insight um you know maybe this is trying to hold but technically that's a lower low still I mean I don't I don't know if we can even Clearly say at this point it it really to to me it's still a question mark I don't know the answer to it um I I thought maybe it could break out against Bitcoin um because you know it broke out against Bitcoin last cycle in a Bitcoin minutes rally but it still hasn't it still hasn't broken out so I I don't know maybe maybe it won't what do I think about Plan B stock to flow model I mean I think it's um look it's just like any other model right it's not going to be perfect but um a model is a model and and if it if it provides Insight that helps people then I think it's worthwhile and I think a lot of people have have found value in it um I I don't have anything negative to say about it I know people people people give them flak for it not going higher last cycle but I mean a lot of people thought it was going to go higher last cycle right I I think like we would definitely be a better asset class if it wasn't so toxical like if people could put out price predictions and if they don't get hit they don't get blasted for a year because of it right um I think it's worthwhile um you know I actually have it on on my website here if you look at the uh stock to flow model um you can actually see it right and what's interesting about it is you can look at the deflection from it right and you can can see that it it had it it went pretty far down below it now it's come back up here I'd be curious though it almost seems like you could draw a trend line through some of these Peaks and I'd be curious as to where that comes in now my my thought is that it will not come to 1 million like I know if if if that is is what the model is calling for which it seems like it is there there's also another there's there's a more conservative model as well that I think was calling for 55k last cycle and that ended up being a lot more accurate this one was not as accurate um and so I I don't think it's going to go to a million this cycle um unfortunately right I don't I don't really like saying that stuff because then like there's always a lot of people out there that'll say well no it is and you're against Bitcoin if you think it's not but kind of like over here when it was it called for 100k and we just never hit it you know I didn't like being the person saying we weren't going to go to 100K in 2021 um and I was very clear that I didn't think we would hit 100K in 2021 I thought it was possible we could hit it later but once the bare Market unfolded in early 2022 I said no it's off like we're we're going down um so no I don't think it's going to go to a you know 1.3 million this cycle but hey I've been wrong about things before maybe I'll be wrong about that um but that that just seems astronomically way too high for this cycle and you can see that every cycle it gets closer to the line right like this cycle over here was well above this one was closer this one was even closer this one didn't even get up to the level that it was at so this time I don't think we'll get anywhere close to it that's my view could I see what eth Bitcoin did in 2019 yeah I mean it it basically came down down to the range lows the same time it did this time and then it didn't break down till July but it broke down when when when when the First Rate cut arrived right so like the First Rate cut occur the same month that e Bitcoin broke down um actually e Bitcoin I think broke down first and then the rate cut arrived right so that's this is what happened in in 2019 is is it had these sort of these range lows and then it took until it took until July to break down from that low there it took it took 83 weeks we're currently already at at 90 weeks right but if you measure it from the second top it took 75 weeks and from this top here we're currently at 78 so we are like we're in that time zone we're in that that time frame but again it will likely still take some time for it to just slowly bleed back down right like it it it it does that a lot right where it doesn't it doesn't make any it it takes the elevator up and then it just takes the stairs slowly back down right look at all these moves over here by E Bitcoin that would have brought people back in and then it still eventually just resolved the downside once rate Cuts arrived so that's the that's the hard part about all this stuff is like I think all of us know that rate cuts are likely going to come at some point and that there's a decent chance that e Bitcoin breaks down when the First Rate cut arrives but who knows when that is what are the gas fees on eth well 160 uh I mean the look The Market is very heated right now right there's no doubt about it I haven't seen it I haven't seen it this high in a long time there's no doubt about no doubt about the fact there's no doubt about the fact that the market is heated right now I'd be curious to see what what Bitcoin transaction fees are doing so they're spiking up a little bit here you can see they they come up they've come off these highs from December um but they've actually just been putting in lower highs since so we'll see if it can if it can put a higher high or not why is Bitcoin dominance dropping when Bitcoin goes down that's different I look I wouldn't I wouldn't concern yourself too much with what happens over the daily time frame like there's been and and I say this sincerely there's been so many people over the last year that has told me like why is Bitcoin dominance going down now does anyone look at the Bitcoin dominance chart today and say why did it go down no it went up who knows what daily time frame it's again I've said this before it's a geometric it's a random walk or geometric Bounty and motion right it's unpredictable but the the general trend has been up right the general trend has been up any given day who knows what the hell is going to happen I know I sure as hell don't um but the general trend is up so yeah I think like you you have to take a step back and and and say look yes in the short term Bitcoin dominance is taking a hit today but it's been up only for a long time and I don't think anyone's going to look at this chart in the future and say why did Bitcoin dominance go down in 2023 like it it went  up could Bitcoin put in a triple toop like gold and break it later yeah it's possible I know some people have sort of uh talked about the idea of of you know sort of a rejection off the alltime high you go back down and then you go up later on like some people talk about that that's possible for sure did Bitcoin top on the First Rate cut last time no last time Bitcoin topped before the First Rate cut but again every cycle is going to be slightly different I mean when you look at the history of of gold and its relationship with the S&P it's not like every time that gold breaks out the S&P collapses when gold broke out in 2008 the S&P collaps when gold broke out in 2019 the S&P continued to go up right so it's not like we can take one example to the bank but yes last cycle Bitcoin topped in June and then the First Rate cut occurred in July this is a fair point if um I understand the concept of Bitcoin dominance but market cap is also increasing it can be external um Fiat not just all bading to Bitcoin that's true and I I've said that before right it's not just alping to bitcoin um but I I think there is some element of that right um but you're right like they alts can also go down against Bitcoin just bitcoin's going up and altcoins are staying flat can you show what happened when Al hit. 39 I mean they fell off a cliff is what happened right I don't know if it's going to happen this cycle and frankly I I I don't really want to be the guy to say that it has to happen because if it doesn't happen I don't even want to imagine what the pitch Works would be like but um yeah like when it when it fell below the range low right if you overlay total three right once we fell below the range low right there that's what marked the top on that purple line which was total three right right right right there right and that's where total three had a larger pullback is it going to be different this time I don't know I just I want you to be aware of what happened last cycle and you can make your own decisions and not blame me right but that's what happened last cycle will it happen again that's for you to decide but again we're also not there yet right like we're not we're still not there but we could get there quickly but we're not there yet does Bitcoin monthly RSI indicate the cycle top is approaching I don't think the monthly RSI is at the same levels that it was back at the prior highs um if again if you pull up the RSI well this is the weekly RSI so the weekly RSI is at 86 8 87 right so is getting pretty high um the monthly I don't think is that high though the month monthly so that's the TW Monon the monthly is at 74 right so here's the here's the monthly RSI trend line so a lot of times being Bitcoin heavy makes the most amount of sense until you know until you until you reach sort of the full extension of the Bitcoin rally but you know there are cases where you don't go all the way to the top right in the in the 2019 19 rally it sort of faded right there when the FED cut rates um and then it got a pullback and then went to the top so we could either you know we could go to the top we could get a pullback and then go up later I don't know there's also the two- we RSI which I I think I briefly looked at right the two-e RSI is getting pretty heated right it's at 86 I mean just kind of drawing a line across the screen you don't hit 86 that frequently now again when we hit 86 in 2021 it was in January so we still had a few months when we hit it over here we had a few weeks um when we hit it right there we had a few weeks these are two week candles remember in here we had a few weeks or maybe a few months um so it's really hard to say but we are getting again the market is relative the Market's heated right I mean who knows how high it's going to go and there's no doubt about the Market's heated fex is 90 okay um yeah the two we RSI shows we we're pretty heated right now but RSI is not the best indicator to use because it can stay overbought for a long time it can stay oversold for a long time it's not the best one to use has Bitcoin ever reached an all-time high before the having no this is the first time if Bitcoin tops a week after gold breaks out does a 60% dominance mean breaking all-time highs or could it could be other any other price still be 6% we already broke alltime highs um so maybe you missed that but we already broke alltime highs um you could go to 60% as Bitcoin USD goes up or goes down I I I don't think it matters you can go to 60% either way and I'm more convinced of that than anything else right I think that Dominus will go up regardless of direction of Bitcoin USD so if you want to expose your crypto I still think Bitcoin is is the better place to be that's my view how much weight you put in the stable coin dominance chart us plus usdc so we looked at USD dominance earlier if you're not familiar with it it's this one um but there's also there's also if you want to add in um usdc dominance you can do the same thing I don't really think it makes a huge difference I think it's more or less just kind of like rounding ER at the end of the day it's kind of a similar Trend right it's not that different any updates on net liquidity and reverse repo yeah I I kind of think net liquidity is doing it what it did last year in fact um it's kind of interesting it's I I've been watching this for a while and it it looks like it's really doing what what it did last year um if you're not familiar what I'm talking about so this is net liquidity here and if you you look at it let's just overlay it with Bitcoin so if you look at net liquidity you can see that sorry let me get rid of this um hold on so if you look at at net liquidity so net liquidity is this yellow line and then this other one is is Bitcoin USD um so if you look at at what it did last year net liquidity kind of had this like phase where it went up for a little while and then it faded as you got into May right and Bitcoin USD found at least a local high after that move up in net liquidity into early April right into early to mid April is where Bitcoin USD found that that Local High um and it kind of looks like here again and by the way this move started in March in early March where net liquidity started to go back up and so you're looking at it here again and it seems like net liquidity is starting to move a little bit higher here and so I wonder if it's going to play out in the same in a similar way where like it it it goes up a little bit and then sort of Fades back down as you get into the summer I I could see something like that happening um for sure but again I mean even even in that case even when that liquidity came down Bitcoin then popped up later on in the summer and put in another high right but I mean it does go to show that like um you know as liquidity as as liquidity slowly goes down alt bed to bitcoin right that's the sort of this is overlaying alt Bitcoin pairs with with net liquidity you can kind of see that as as net liquidity goes down the valuation of altcoins against Bitcoin goes down as net liquidity goes up the valuation of altcoins against Bitcoin generally goes up right all right guys I think we're going to wrap it up thank you guys for tuning in it's been almost two hours if you guys like the content

cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin. They discuss Bitcoin's recent all-time high, the implications of altcoin surges against Bitcoin, and the importance of Bitcoin dominance. The speaker suggests that the current market conditions, including the breakout in gold and the strength of Bitcoin, indicate that Bitcoin could continue to rally and potentially reach new highs.However, the speaker also acknowledges the potential for a pullback, highlighting historical patterns and the need to monitor key indicators like the Fear and Greed Index. The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the market dynamics and being prepared for potential volatility.The speaker delves deeper into the altcoin market, explaining that while altcoins can see short-term surges against Bitcoin, the general trend has been for them to slowly fade back and bleed against the king cryptocurrency. The speaker cautions that altcoins tend to become the dinosaur coins of the next cycle, and advises taking profits back to Bitcoin.The speaker also discusses the importance of monitoring other market indicators, such as gold and the labor market data, as they can provide signals about the potential direction of the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, the speaker suggests keeping an eye on the USD dominance index, as it has historically been a good indicator of market turning points.The speaker further elaborates on the potential relationship between Bitcoin dominance and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. They suggest that Bitcoin dominance could potentially top around the time of a Fed pivot, as Bitcoin may outperform altcoins during periods of quantitative tightening and high interest rates. The speaker also notes that the recent breakout in gold could be a signal that the Fed has gone too far, potentially indicating an upcoming pivot.Overall, the main message and conclusion of the summary is that the current market conditions suggest a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, but the speaker also cautions that a pullback or reversal is possible, and investors should closely monitor key indicators and be prepared for potential volatility.",406,"[0.024871826, 0.020568848, 0.017532349, 0.012306213, -0.007423401, -0.016616821, 0.001748085,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin the beauty of mathematics part 44 if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom we do this video series on the first of every month so that we can take a step back from what's going on in the daytoday the week to week you know we take take a step back from looking at all the little things we look at on a more daily basis and just say all right where is the asset class right now is it undervalued is it overvalued is it fairly valued and and that's the purpose of of the video and and I know it's called Bitcoin but it's actually the total market cap as of March 1st 2024 the total market cap of the entire cryptocurrency asset class is coming at about 2.27 6 trillion with the fair value being about 2.3 78 trillion this represents an undervaluation of approximately 4.3% now Bitcoin has been undervalued or sorry total market cap has been in undervaluation territory essentially if you exclude popping above it here in August 2022 since June of 2022 so we we're going on almost two years of being in that undervaluation phase and now that the question sort of raises is is that out of the ordinary it's not you know historically we can spend years in undervaluation territory in fact one of the prior Market cycles that a lot of people like to compare this one to even though I do think there are some distinct differences but is a 2015 2016 cycle and in that case you can see that it went undervalued in January 2015 and did not go to any type of overvaluation until 2 and a half years later almost about 20 what so 20 28 months or so um so almost almost two and a half years before it actually went into overvaluation territory and if you look at the cycle before that you can see that we we did poke our head into overvaluation territory a little bit but we didn't durably go there until the post having year so in last cycle we durably went overvalued in Q4 of the having year the cycle before that we durably went overvalued in q two of the postav year and the cycle before that we went durably overvalued in q1 of the post having year so in all three prior cases entering sort of a durable overvaluation phase occurred sometime between Q4 of the having year to Q2 of the post having year that's at least what we have historically seen right and the the reason why I'm bringing that up is because we are approaching ing that overvaluation territory right I mean we're only 4% below the fair value logarithmic regression trend line now again there was a period in 2019 where we went overvalued for a while but what I mean by durable overvaluation really is where you're spending like you know a year right I mean we went overvalued here in November 2020 we didn't go back down below it until June 2022 right I mean that was well over a year of being overvalued so when I say durable overvaluation I'm talking about these phases right May 2017 until December 18 right well you're o in overvaluation territory for like the better part of 1 to two years not just a few months like it was over here this was like April to to September right so really not even half a year of overvaluation territory back in 2019 so when we think about durable overvaluation it means really aggressively going into that upper overvaluation range and staying there for a longer period of time now what's fascinating is that when Bitcoin sorry when the total market cap fell below the fair value logarithmic aggression trend line the fair value was at about 1 trillion and then when we went back up to it the fair value was about 1.13 trillion the fair value today is about twice that at around 2 you know 2.4 trillion almost um and the reason why the fair value goes up it's it's a monotonically increasing function is because we assume that adoption is happening within the cryptocurrency asset class now that assumption is not really baked into the model the model is just taking new count the data it doesn't concern itself with what's going on in you know Bitcoin adoption it just sort of looks at the data and says well based on the data this is the fair value of the asset class and so again we can spend a long time being undervalued and we can spend a long time being overvalued and what history shows history shows that during undervaluation territory what tends to happen is market share goes away away from altcoins and towards Bitcoin right away from alts and then towards Bitcoin but as you get into parabolic rallies above the fair value logarithmic regression trend line that can shift away from Bitcoin and back to to all coins so it's important to you remember that now one of the things to note is that a lot of times we will get relatively close to that lower green regression trend line before durably going overvalued and fact it actually happened over here in in March 2020 you might say well that's not really that close that was not that was the daily close if you look at the lower band we went down to about 102 um or the lower band was 102 billion and if you go look at total market cap back then you can see that it actually dropped all the way down to around that same level like the low 100 billion range so an important consideration to make also back over here in August 2015 the lower band was at around 3 billion ion and if we go take a look at where total market cap was back then you can see that it went right around three billion right um and so we've talked about you know that general idea in the past of of of getting close to that before durably going into overvaluation territory again we're approaching it now right we we are aggressively approaching it now we're only 4% or so away from the over valuation territory so it will be interesting to see what the reaction is at that level because during this whole period while total market cap is the same as it was back in April of 2022 we know that the the the composition of the of the asset class is completely different right I mean a lot more of that capital is in Bitcoin as opposed to to altcoins right there's been a rotation of that capital from alts to bitcoin as the relative flight to safety has has really taken over right and so when we think about where we are today what we can do is we can take the percent difference from the fair value and the actual current market cap and see you know how far you know where are we in terms of overvaluation undervaluation and you can see that we are approaching the red line which represents the fair value and if we go back and look at history you can see a couple of things right in this cycle right in the 2012 cycle we went overvalued briefly and then we went overvalued again briefly and then on the third attempt we went durably overvalued right it was a third attempt in this cycle it was the first attempt right once we went into overation territory we stayed there and then last cycle the first attempt didn't really wasn't really durable it only lasted a few months the second attempt wasn't durable either the third attempt kind of got us there and then the fourth attempt we really blasted through so that just kind of shows you you know where we were each time when we went durably overvalued and again this one here was post having year this was post having year this was Q4 of the having year right now we're in q1 of the having year so what it shows you is kind of where we are right we talked about how you know we are pretty heated right now I don't think anyone would deny that the asset class is somewhat heated everyone's watching the price um you know on an hourly basis it seems right so we are somewhat heated um for sure and and I think that is best represented by the idea that normal durable overvaluation territory doesn't occur until late having year or early post having year and we are now approaching that territory and we're only in q1 of the having year right so um that is you know at least something to to keep in mind and so you know if there is if there is a cool off phase let's say sometime you know after the having or something for a little bit but that would be relatively normal right we we saw that over here um in 2012 um we saw it over here in 2016 right and we also saw it um you know being undervalued well into the having year of 2020 so that wouldn't be out of the ordinary if something like that were to happen um but in the meantime you know it's just important to always take a step back and say where are we generally speaking in terms of the entire Market cycle and technically we are still below the fair value logarithmic regression trend line now I've been an advocate of a Bitcoin heavy portfolio during undervaluation territory especially during QT and higher rates because Capital should leave alts and go to bitcoin and I'd like to think that that's what's largely happened right I'd like to think that's what's largely happened um and that phase I think think will continue for a longer you know for for longer you know that Capital sort of eventually making its way to bitcoin slowly but surely and that continuing to provide Bitcoin um with that liquidity that it needs so interesting way to look at the market I think just to take a step back see what is the fair value what is the current market cap how undervalued or overvalued are we are we and also understanding that we can stay undervalued for a long period of time and in terms of how long we were undervalued before we went durably overvalued if we just kind of exclude the 2019 phase um which maybe we shouldn't excluded but just a sort of phrase it is how long did it take once we went undervalued to reach a phase where we went to overvaluation territory that lasted for at least a year here it was from November of 2018 until November of 2020 so it was two years approximately here it was January 2015 until May 2017 so just over two years and then over here it was you know October 2011 to February 2013 so just over a year right now we were June 2022 until March 2024 right so this coming June will be two years um last couple of Cycles it was about two to two and a half years okay and and the 2-year Mark will be reached um about 3 months from now so not not not that far off um the 2 and a half year mark of course would be reached if it if it were to play out like this cycle over here which I know a lot of people have compared to it would you know it would essentially mean two and a half years from from from where we dropped below and that would basically put us all the way out at the end of the year right at the end of 2024 so uh just a different way to think about the market hopefully you guys find this uh you know these this series useful to kind of keep you focused on the long-term trend of the asset class how the asset class how the composition of the asset class changes over time and how you know in undervaluation territory Bitcoin heavy portfolios tend to do better um and then once you get really durably overvalued after that Bitcoin parabolic rally is over that's when altcoins tend to outperform for a while so just something to to remember the overvaluation phase the undervaluation phase it's pretty normal unfortunately we can't just stay on the fair value that would obviously be a a lot more simpler but the way the markets work we go undervalued we go overvalued and we just sort of you know EB and flow right from extreme fear to extreme greed and back and forth and back and forth I've also said before right that ultimately my goal for the asset class is to reach approximately A1 trillion do market capitalization plus to minus a few trillion and as we go to sleep at night we cannot help a wonder what's a few trillion dollars among friends thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at inth cryptoverse decom also note that we have a free tier on the website and the free tier actually includes this chart right so make sure you guys check that out I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-02-29 00:00:00,"The video provides a detailed technical analysis of the cryptocurrency market, focusing on the total market capitalization and its relationship to the fair value logarithmic regression trend line. The speaker notes that the total market cap is currently undervalued by around 4.3%, and that this undervaluation has persisted for nearly two years, which is not unusual based on historical market cycles. The speaker suggests that during periods of undervaluation, capital tends to flow from altcoins to Bitcoin, as investors seek a flight to safety. The speaker also discusses the concept of durable overvaluation, where the market remains significantly above the fair value trend line for an extended period, typically between 1-2 years. The speaker argues that the cryptocurrency market is currently approaching this durable overvaluation territory, which has historically occurred in the late-having year or early post-having year periods. The overall sentiment of the transcript is cautiously bullish, as the speaker suggests that the current undervaluation presents an opportunity for a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio, while also acknowledging the potential for a cooling-off period before the market enters a more sustained overvaluation phase.",226,"[-0.008590698, -0.010559082, -0.028457642, 0.016494751, -0.0008225441, -0.042785645,

hey everybody Welcome to the no shill Zone with Ben and myself hope everyone's doing well um yeah so I I think right out of the gate we should talk about bitcoin's move here I think that's the first thing on the radar I can just quickly show it on my chart then we'll flip it over to yours Ben here but basically what we're doing we saw we can see this little area here that kept on getting hit over and over again and then weekend price action floated up and today we're seeing a little follow through rally I have resistance currently sitting at this upper band of this trend line which is just above 54,000 uh we're only about 1,400 bucks away from there so I think that is a very real possibility that we could be headed into into that level then that's the next big test what do you have on the docket yeah I mean Bitcoin keeps repeating this pattern of getting a really strong move up consolidating going higher and then sort of retesting some of these longer term moving averages right strong move up consolidation up down um and it and it kind of just keeps repeating itself right where after these strong moves up we consolidate for a little bit put in a higher high get a get a bit of a reset and I I think that's likely what's going on right now and you know the other thing too and I've I've I know everyone's fully aware of my views on on sort of the the Bitcoin dominant stuff but you know when you see when you see like the eth Bitcoin valuation rally like it has and you see some of these all Bitcoin valuations rally like they have and if you believe in the Bitcoin dominance theory that it's going higher that just means there's all that liquidity from those altcoins that'll just eventually make their way back over to bitcoin especially you know as the having approaches and and all that stuff so yeah I mean it seems like it seems like there's liquidity there that that Bitcoin can absorb back um but we know that that's a long process and you know the dominance has taken a bit of a hit recently but when I see right when I see e Bitcoin rally back up to like 006 I just think to myself all right well that liquidity will likely eventually make its way um back over to to bitcoin do you are you concerned and this is something I talked about this morning is that you know we've seen even though the FED is supposedly restrictive on their monetary policy they instituted uh two two procedures right one was the uh the emergency lending program they started that in March of 2023 um because of the the Silicon Valley bank failures and a bunch of these Banks failing and and essentially it gave the ability for banks to borrow money at essentially zero interest rates or close to that and then basically Supply themselves and they could actually loan this money out um at regular interest rates right um that the FED has announced that that's coming to an end I think it's on March 11th or March 9th and then the reverse repo Market is another one in fact I have a chart of this here um basically for those of you that don't know the reverse repo Market was a place where the the banks could park money uh during periods where they just wanted to put money aside right it was it was a way for them to do that and and and I want to just show this right so if we look at this chart this is when reverse repo and basically when you park money at the FED it's being taken out of the banks meaning it's essentially taking liquidity out of the system and if we look at the reverse repo it started in in basically November of 2021 which by the way coincided with the Bitcoin top and the stock market top and it topped out in 2022 and started to fall in October of 2022 which is when the stock market topped out before this run from there until now and essentially when you see this dropping this means the FED is pushing money or giving money back to the banks essentially re liquid you know giving them massive amounts of liquidity this was almost 2.4 million trillion dollars and they've now they've pushed this all the way in and I guess my point here is that if you look at this number it's getting close to this longer term kind of normalization which means that eventually the FED won't be pushing this much money back into the banking system and then if you talk about the the lending program that I mentioned that that's coming to an end I do wonder if asset prices which have been elevated due to liquidity are they due for this kind of like starvation mode where you don't have the same liquidity flowing into the markets I don't know I'd love to hear your your thoughts on it Ben yeah I mean the the reverse repo sort of he guess has been kind of like a stealth way for QE I mean it's it's sort of been able to offset some of the QT that fed has been doing and you know they've been sort of butting heads but um one one thing that I I I like to look at which by the way I mean it takes into account that that metric the reverse repo this is the the net liquidity it's like an approximation of global net liquidity and and it's the central it's the C it's the fed's balance sheet subtract out reverse repo because we know that they're adding liquidity by by reducing that and also subtract out the TGA and then by the way add in the central sorry I'm sick um add in the central banks of of you know a lot of different other countries and you get something looks like this and um and yeah I mean you can see that liquidity has been draining for or you know or has been slowly moving down for a while although Bitcoin has deviated from that right like if you were to if we were to Overlay this um you can see that I mean it's funny because it it we did the same exact thing last cycle right where we we follow net liquidity for a time and then at some point we deviate away from it um same thing happened last cycle but where I think this liquidity stuff is is more useful um is is is looking at how highrisk assets bleed to lowrisk assets right like look at this same chart look at like the Russell divided and when you look at the Russell divided by the NASDAQ you can see that you know I mean it as this has been going down over a long enough period of time right the Russell bleeds to the NASDAQ right the same thing like you know like total three divided by Bitcoin same idea I mean you know these charts I I I think these charts line up a little bit better anyways um with that general idea so yeah I mean my guess is that in the short term I I could see net liquidity going back up a little bit um mainly because it's dependent on the dollar because if we're adding up the central bank balance sheets of all these other countries it's spend on the dollar and the dollar is is you know it's pulling back here in the short term right it's it's finding at least some resistance here at around the 20we Ese and I've said before I think you know this kind of reminds me of the whole Bitcoin dominance carving out a bottom um and if it follows that Bitcoin dominance carving out a bottom move then it means you know forming some type of higher low um somewhere somewhere over here so I I I think that is really useful um especially looking at high risk against low risk yeah and just to show my dollar chart what I have here is is yeah just like you were mentioning the Dollar's gotten a little weaker we had this little short-term UPS sloping trend line here that we've broken um but again you know you could make a case that you still have low higher low higher low at this point we haven't made lower lows yet so so it could eventually turn back up but I do think looking at this trend line this would be the one that I really watch uh not that one there this one right up here is if we do start to turn back up we've got to get through that now if you break through this Downs sloping longer I mean this one goes back to the 2022 highs on the dollar which again that was basically when the markets turned around right you know when Bitcoin bottomed out when we saw um um the other assets really like the stock market really bottomed out starting to move up so that'll be interesting to see is if we can break above that in the dollar how does that react or how to asset prices react yeah and you know like liquidity last cycle had a very similar type of move although I think this cycle it's been a lot more pronounced um you know last cycle the S&P sort of topped out right there in you know right in January 2018 right as net liquidity topped out um and then you can see that there was two clear distinct bounces in net liquidity right there and the first bounce the first like sort of top corresponded to the S&P bottom right that first that first bounce corresponded to the S&P bottom same thing over here right like s liquidity topped out right there that's where the S&P topped out and then this first bounce that's where the S&P bottomed right like it's the um it's a very similar type of pattern and then the second bounce is is was sort of after the S&P was was making some of these more durble all-time highs right and that's kind of where we are right now um and then the question is is if it continues to play out it means you know we have a few more weeks the S&P gets another correction maybe not un maybe not that dissimilar from what we saw right there could also be could also happen as the long end of the yield curve goes back up remember the long end of the yield curve is what caused that move to the downside um and if inflation remains sticky we could see that again and then you know then you get another move Higher by the S&P and then finally QE has to return in all this Glory as the FED is forced to Pivot but again that's a long process to carry out yeah yeah no I agree I agree 100 per. so are you thinking I mean we've seen ethereum really rock and roll here I mean really amazing move on ethereum uh just continuing to power higher do you have any upside levels that you're thinking it could go to um you know based on the Bitcoin ethereum chart or anything like that well so I I think it I I think eth can top out when eth Bitcoin goes below 049 so it's not really like a price per se because it's kind of a game of chicken right like it's hard to know what the eth valuation will be if and when eth Bitcoin is below 0049 but when we have a weekly close below 049 for eth Bitcoin that's where I think ethusd will finally get a larger correction right so you know right now eth Bitcoin is is back down to 0.0059 um and and my guess and I you know my guess is that eth Bitcoin will likely top out you know relatively soon Pro it could be it could even be this week you know I I don't know um but I I do think it it will slowly bleed back down kind of like it did over here kind of like it did back over here and then once that happens I I think then you start to think all right well this could end up forming forming a top for for ethusd so that's that's my view just below 049 then I think ethusd gets a larger correction hard to say exactly where that's going to happen I mean and we talked about last week in um 2019 eth rallied from like 80 bucks to to 360 and and this rally has been you know 900 or maybe like 880 and it's all the way up to 3100 so you know if it's if it's emulating this as a as a sort of a 10x move from from the low to the high then there could still be a little bit more room for it but again it's going to be dependent on on bitcoin yeah I have I have um a 618 FIB retrace that's that's kind of on my radar coming up here um looks to be right around uh let's see here uh yeah right around 30 just above 3,300 so just an interesting level to watch around 3325 that'll be the 618 from the uh previous high on the cycle on the bull market cycle from here to the low so I think I think you're right about that it does I mean just based on the relative strength too you would assume it uh it should push a little bit higher here um any any thoughts what are your latest thoughts on any altcoins do you have anything that you know I know I know your views in general are Bitcoin dominance but but I mean do you think the altcoins are going to get another massive run or or do you think like did when salana hit 126 and change was that a top for the cycle I don't know man I mean Al alss alts are are a very risky business for sure and I mean some of them are like I mean there was one last week was it a Unis swap that just like went up yeah in a day um that was nuts yeah I like I I mean if you look at like all Bitcoin pairs my my view is that they are are likely gonna sort of slowly turn this corner and come back down to the range lows yeah one of the things sorry I was going to say one of the things I did notice is when we had like early last week before Nvidia earnings we had a a some down days in the stock market where you saw the tech stocks even selling off and it was interesting because Bitcoin didn't do much it just kind of held steady but the altcoins actually did make shorter near-term lows which just shows you that you know the altcoins yes they can make you a fortune but there really are they are risk assets right I mean they're the the classic case of riskiest of assets and so as long as the stock market is doing its thing I mean Nvidia I think today is up on the day they seem to be doing okay um but but but I do wonder if you start to see that bigger corrective move in stocks do the alts take the biggest blow which you would assume they would you know one interesting thing about all this is you know I know we talk about a lot about like Bitcoin dominance right um but I I think that same principle can be applied to like other asset classes as well and I'd be curious like what your thoughts are on the EV space because you know Tesla has been I mean Tesla hasn't really been doing that great in recent months but we saw after earnings last week we saw lucid and rivan take absolutely monstrous hits and and what's fascinating to me is in the same way that I you know I ultimately expect all to revisit these lows against Bitcoin and ultimately likely break down look at something like the rivan valuation divided by the Tesla valuation and look how perfect it is right that it is now revisiting wow that exact level this is the June 2023 low now the rivan valuation against Tesla is now at that low basically almost to the to the you know to the decimal place um amazing and and so yeah I I I think that this is kind of showing us the path for for all Bitcoin pairs right like this is what's likely going to happen they're likely going to bleed back down to their summer 2023 low and we're seeing this across you know various asset classes and by the way I mean some of them are weaker and some of them are stronger right like rivan only just now got back down to this level but if you were to like look at the Lucid Tesla valuation it broke below that June 2023 low long ago right showing that rivan has been relatively stronger than Lucid although they've both been relatively weak against against Tesla interesting yeah yeah I was just brought up my Tesla chart and I was just noticing this bigger wedge pattern that's really started back in 2020 the lows of covid and then again you could see the highs how it they just align and this is this is just the coolest stuff for me with charts is how you know why did price stop here or here or here you know it seems an arbitrary number but it just all aligns perfectly and and basically as a technician you can watch watch this and say okay well we're going to stay inside of this range which is basically right now between 245 and 140 but eventually one of these these these lines will continue to come towards ahead right I mean if we continue to extend them out at some point and we can even guesstimate it looks like in March of 20 basically a year from now price will have had to have broken one way or the other and then you know you look at some of the economic data do we do we slip into a recession does that become a bigger issue I right now at least at least all the word I'm reading on this on on news articles is that Eevees are now out of you know they're not in Vogue anymore right it's just the sales are slowing and all that but then again you throw a recession into the mix where does that take Tesla so so again just I mean the beautiful thing about a wedge pattern is that you know when it breaks out you know when it breaks down it's very clear on the chart I do at least think Tesla will survive any like is if there is a recession I think they have a strong enough cash balance to survive I think the harder thing is you know do do do lucid and rivan and and and Neo right do these other know these other EV companies do they have enough to survive because a lot of them are are by a lot I think I mean like almost all of them are are cash flow negative yeah and I would I would assume rivan won't on its own my guess is they're going to get gobbled up by you know Ford or GM I mean you know there was even an article I read this weekend that was talking about hey you know Ford or GM should just buy them and so at this these levels it's so minimal and then then you know then it can be an offering by for GM one of cars maybe but um but yeah man it's wild um speaking of uh let's talk a little gold real quick here uh gold today having a little bit of a pullback but um but at least for me I still and you know you know just like just like you and Bitcoin dominance it's me and gold so we we have our we have our passion plays here it's the same idea right I mean it's all about the flight to relative safety right gold or or say Bitcoin relative safety overalls yep exactly that's what it is that's what it is and and I think I think it's important to recognize is that just like with alts you may not make the most money like an ALT can go up a THX I mean probably in a short time bitcoin's not going to do that Gold's not going to do 100x in a year either I mean that would be shocking if it did but it but again it it protects you against unforeseen issues where where I I do still think that like some of the charts that I was looking at this weekend are just it's scary how how addicted this economy is and and the stock market and even the crypto markets are to liquidity and does that again reinvigorate inflation I mean we've seen and by the way we'll get pce numbers out this week which will be the the favored in number for the FED but does that also show an uptick and I think I think I actually was noticing that the forecast is for an uptick in pce now it doesn't tell us what the markets will do because the markets are expecting the uptick but if it's more than expected is all this liquidity that's still in the system going to reinvigorate inflation and do we see the 1970s you know possible move up again you know a lot of people have been comparing it to the 1970s but yeah I mean as far as gold um my my my sort of thought process on gold has been that it you know if it gets above that 2070 level this these highs I I think that's a riskof signal right to to risk assets like if gold is breaking out but the trick is that that hasn't actually happened yet right and it's the same thing as like the E Bitcoin valuation hasn't actually broken down yet and so until that happens you know this the market can continue on right it's just a game of chicken with a fed and you know the market continuously pricing in rate cuts and then those rate cuts getting pushed further and further and further out um and and and by the way I mean you know as these rat cats get pushed further out that becomes very detrimental for these companies like these rivan and these these Lucid they need that a lot more than Tesla needs it even though Tesla needs it too Tesla can survive right lucid and rivan they need that like you know they need looser looser monetary policy um yes just on that same note sorry to interrupt but you know people need to realize is not only do we have I think some some crazy amount like seven trillion ion Dollar in US Government debt that's maturing that's going to have to roll over at much higher interest rates but also we're talking about corporate debt like you're talking about with these rivan and these other players that a lot of times when they borrowed money a few years ago three years ago let's say they were paying almost like you know less than 1% interest and that's going to get rolled into what four five six percent on these corporate corporate notes it's going to be a huge drain on on on their ability to turn profits right you know one one interesting thing I was looking at because you mentioned like the whole retracement stuff earlier with um with regards to I can't remember which one it was but oh ethereum right ethereum yeah um what what I thought was interesting is if you actually look at the fiber tracem of eth Bitcoin like from that high to the low what you'll see is it actually retraced between the 786 and the one um but the reason why it's interesting is because that level was slightly above the first high but slightly below the second high right like it didn't make a new high um and so I'm curious you know if you go look at like Bitcoin USD again I have no idea how high this is going to go before you get a a larger pullback but you know we're not that far away from the 786 right yeah um and and you know there there were two peaks as well just like with eth Bitcoin there were two peaks eth us or yeah Bitcoin USD had two peaks and so you know It ultimately becomes a game of chicken like what where does Bitcoin need to go to break e Bitcoin down right how high does it have to go and I think that's ultimately what it's it's the liquidity is flowing back and forth right and and eventually I think it breaks it down and then we we sort of finally see that larger pullback but until that time um who knows you know who knows I mean we have the having coming up in what just a couple months less than a couple months in fact um yeah yeah yeah and and and also there's there's the uh there's of course a narrative to fight it for ethereum and that's the spot ETF like what are your views on that like about the spot ETF for E do you think it's going to be consequential for the markets I mean I do think so I think it's going to be a little slower moving I think the excitement over eth at least as of now like if you were to talk to 100 people on the street many more would have heard of Bitcoin and be much more interested in the Bitcoin spot ETF but there's still there's still a market for it um for me it's just just always investors I think in in Bitcoin specifically but eventually eth they have to remember that it works both ways right so right now every every week I'm saying oh a new record for liqu you know for for buyers and money going into these ETFs but remember when the stock market sells off and people get scared that will work on the reverse so you just have to you know be aware that I think a lot of in bitcoiners they're they really think like oh it's always going to be another billion dollars or two billion every single week going forward and that's not going to be the case and eventually it can have a very big detrimental like if you get investors freaking out over something and they just want to get out of everything it can have a big impact as well on uh on bitcoin's price so I think eth is e will be important but um but probably not as important I'm guessing right well I mean you saw the uh you were trading the dot crash I I believe right and I mean look what happened with QQQ after that that one launched I mean it went up what 2x from where it launched and then and then look what happened after it um but again like that that process it took a year you know for it to ultimately top out um so yeah just something something something to think about and I think that's important to recognize is that the timing of everything is is hard I mean it's I think it's it's very easy for us to look at the data and look at you know in inverse uh inverted yield curves once they un invert I mean but again we don't know when that uninversity inverted yield curve on inverting so timing is so hard man I mean that's something for 20 almost 25 years of trading timing is always the trickiest thing right and that's why people should have you know or that's why I think it's a good idea to just have kind of like an investing strategy not really based on trying to time exactly when it occurs right and so like you know Bitcoin I think it gives exposure to the upside while minimizing the downside risk gold same idea right I mean Gold's probably gonna outperform the other I mean it's probably gonna outperform silver I imagine for for a while um there there was another thing that you know we talk about Bitcoin dominance a lot but there's another dominance metric that might be interesting to talk about and that's usdt dominance um and what's really cool about this one is look at you know think about where all of these occurred right like these these where it tagged this trend line right and everyone's going to know exactly where Bitcoin was at the time this was January 2018 right June 2019 right that was just before a larger drop this was just before the pandemic drop February 2020 this was March 2021 this was November 2021 um and so I I think that and and and the reason I'm bringing it up now is I I brought it up I think about a month ago we were talking about it you know when it was back up here testing that 20 we SME it started to drop again and my the concern here is you know is it going to that 4% level right and if it does is it going to emulate what it has done previously when it hit these you know the this sort of this this trend line here so something something that to keep in the back of your mind I think do you think that we'll see you know are you more in alignment with interest rates you know that that we'll see three Cuts later this year I mean do you have any sense on on where that likely will come in I mean obviously we can look at the FED fed watch tool but we know the market has been always favoring Cuts faster than what it seems like right I mean if you went by the market we were gonna have a cut last year and we didn't right right yeah I think we'll probably have at least a few Cuts this year but um I I I don't think we're gonna you know unless unless something catastrophic happens right like there's like a Black Swan event um I don't think we're going to have what the market was initially hoping for right I mean it could I mean honestly it it very well could play out in a very similar manner as 2019 did I mean and it is so far I mean you know if you look at 2019 what's interesting and and I think the path to getting there has been slightly different um which is why it might be um uh sort of throwing people uh by surprise a little bit but if you look at at what happened the last time the FED paused Bitcoin dropped a little bit and then went on a fairly spectacular rally and that rally did not end until just before the First Rate cut arrived right and again if you look at at this cycle you know look what happened right when the FED Pauls Bitcoin sold off you know just like it did right there and then it's gone on a rally the main difference though is before the Pauls here Bitcoin sold off 50% right before this pause Bitcoin was going up but once the Pauls arrived Bitcoin has been playing out in a very similar fashion right draw down and then just sort of a slow grind entire um into one month before the First Rate cut so I don't know when the First Rate Cut's going to come maybe is May could be June um I don't know but as the FED started to cut last cycle that's where crypto finally took a breather and the S&P left crypto behind actually I'm sure you remember in during those rate cuts a lot of these you know a lot of smaller com companies loved seeing loose monetary policy but for some reason crypto uh just couldn't keep up once those lower rates actually actually arrived yeah yeah and speaking of which yeah we we have seen the underperformance of the Russell compared to the NASDAQ I mean is probably the the widest difference in performance between two indexes that generally are made up of many similar companies obviously the mag s not so much in there but but yeah it's been amazing to see how small caps have underperformed that's actually one of my favorite trades right now is looking for a catch-up trade in the short term it's not a long-term trade because I think once we hit a recession small caps are going to get crushed but there's this this period where you'll probably see a little money rotation out of the large players some profit taking there and I think you could see a catch up in um especially if pce numbers come in decently this this week then you'll see the Russell really rip to the upside yeah and it's kind of funny how similar this is right like as it after the pivot and then rallies and then consolidates for a few weeks that's kind of like our our ETF consolidation you know and then it rallies a few more weeks and then gets a red week kind of like we just saw right rallies a few more weeks then we get another red week here um maybe maybe we're sort of going into that Final Phase where that liquidity just really goes back to bitcoin um yeah and and it and it and and I know like right now I've been getting a ton of messages from people saying like hey what do you think about eth Bitcoin right because it's it's rallied back up but you know it did the same thing in 2019 as well right in fact at the same exact time I mean February 2019 look at that eth Bitcoin rallied for a few weeks and it almost it almost took out that prior high from December but it it didn't actually quite take it out out and then it just slowly rolled back over um I don't know I I I mean we're not that far away from taking out that high so I don't want to say it can't happen but it is something to sort of keep in the back of your mind yeah I agree I agree and it looks like the dominance at least my dominance chart just continues to kind of hammer on this area of resistance here I'll pop it up real quick but you can see that we just kind of keep on tiptoe above this line of dominance and getting kind of rejected here but really one of the things to just keep in mind at least as a Trader you look at patterns like this right so you can start to see a kind of a a channel development here uh bear with me as I do that but look at that it's almost a perfect little parallel Channel um which again that's actually bullish like if you just took that like if someone just said hey this is a stock chart or this is a whatever chart I'd be like oh man that's that's getting ready to break out to the upside it's just consolidating in a flag pattern there so be interesting to see at what point that happens and if you go back if could you go to the February 2019 not on on my chart but on your chart Dre a very similar parallel Channel like in the first few months of 2019 like right right um no before that the one right here that parallel Channel and that was that was going into the First Rate cut right yeah and then eventually it broke it broke to the upside and and and just went on a massive dominance rally that's a great Point yeah it's amazing how these patterns repeat over and over again doesn't matter the asset class folks but but again if you learn to spot these patterns it doesn't make you 100% Trader no one ever is but it puts the odds in your favor especially when you have a nice trend line to notice when the breakout occurs um that really is helpful as well so yeah very very cool you can even see right here it looks like there was kind of another it's a little steeper I don't like the steeper ones quite as much right but it was kind of the same sort of thing and then it broke out before it finally collapsed and you can almost see here how once it got back inside that's where that bigger drop happened like once it failed once it broke back inside of the channel that's where he really got hammered to the downside so it's kind of what we would refer to as a failed breakout at that point um you get significant downside yeah and I mean I that's sort of the the argument with with the dominant stuff is that um you know last I mean going back to all this liquidity stuff it was it was precisely last cycle where if you like overlay say just the balance sheet of the FED right I mean that is where dominance finally topped after that you know after that final parallel Channel I mean that's where it It ultimately topped I mean yes it did sweep the high later on but I don't think that was nearly as consequential of a move as this one was um because this one this one was faded almost immediately this one took I mean this one took like a year to fade back down interesting yeah I think we should wrap it up there been about 30 minutes guys if you're not subscribed to Gareth make sure you do so links to his socials are down in the description below and we will see you guys next week yeah same thing guys follow follow Ben here and uh appreciate you guys tuning in as always guys thank you so much and we'll see you next week take care y",Youtube video,2024-02-26 00:00:00,"The discussion focuses on the technical analysis of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. It examines the recent price movements, resistance levels, and the potential impact of changes in global liquidity and monetary policies on asset prices.The analysts express a bullish sentiment on Bitcoin's long-term trajectory, citing the upcoming halving event and the potential for altcoin liquidity to flow back into Bitcoin. However, they also caution about the risks associated with high-risk assets, such as altcoins, in the face of tightening monetary conditions. They believe Bitcoin and gold are relatively safer assets compared to altcoins and other high-risk investments, and they recommend a cautious approach to navigating the current market environment.The discussion also delves into the concept of USDT (Tether) dominance, which the analysts believe is an important metric to monitor. They note that USDT dominance has historically reached significant levels before larger market drops, and they suggest keeping an eye on whether it reaches the 4% level, as it could signal potential market turbulence.Furthermore, the analysts explore the potential impact of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. They draw parallels between the current cycle and the 2019 cycle, where Bitcoin experienced a sell-off after the Fed paused, followed by a rally leading up to the first rate cut. The analysts believe a similar pattern could play out this time, with Bitcoin potentially consolidating and then rallying in the lead-up to the first rate cut.Additionally, the discussion touches on the underperformance of the Russell 2000 index compared to the Nasdaq, which the analysts view as a potential opportunity for a catch-up trade in the short term, although they caution that small-caps may face challenges during a recession.Overall, the refined summary provides a more comprehensive understanding of the technical analysis, market dynamics, and the analysts' perspectives on the current cryptocurrency and broader market environment.",379,"[0.05734253, 0.041046143, -0.021270752, -0.027038574, 0.04135132, -0.026672363, 0.033569336, -0.039642334, -0.032318115, 0.051361084,

hey everybody Welcome to the no shill Zone your favorite data Duo is back at work here even on a president day holiday here in the US how are you doing Ben pretty good Gareth how about you good man so where did I'm going to throw it throw it to you where do you want to start today um well I mean of course I think people would want probably want us to start with uh with Bitcoin because you know it's hanging out at at 52k had a nice push up above the spot ETF highs and maybe maybe we could just sort of jump in about where do you think we go from here do you think there's any more room in the short term uh to go higher I mean ethereum you know eth has continued to move up even though Bitcoin has been some still the last few days uh so what are your thoughts about that yeah so so a couple things here so if we just jump over to this chart and this is the Bitcoin chart right I always find these things fascinating because when when most people look at charts they think it's just chaos right it's ups Downs lefts rights whatever it is but in reality if you take a look at the lows in October of 2023 and you connect it to the exact low of um January 2024 that line there's a parallel you can bring up and it literally gave us the high here before this consolidation move the high of the the spot ETF approval and then also the recent high right here so just as a technician and again this is purely data data driven is that I look at that and I say okay well in general we pull back off of these lines now it doesn't mean that every time you do eventually you can break out of it and go to the upside I think we were talking about just before we started the show that you know ultimately you can go up for longer periods than anyone expects to be honest before you get any sort of corrective move so right now again I am I am looking for a little bit of a pullback in Bitcoin I don't know how deep it's going to be the the the the pivot point that I'm going to watch for is the previous high so I always rotate back to the previous level that we were rejected from in this case it's the 49,000 level right here where the spot ETF was approved I think as long as we stay above this 49 then I think you look at and say okay neutral to positive bias yeah we could pull back a little off this trend line but if we were to break below 49 and essentially have a failed breakout that for me at least would be where I would start to say okay this could turn out to be a bigger move to the downside what's kind of interesting is if you look at sort of the rli of Bitcoin as measured from key points like you know if you want to take it from like the um if you look at like you know as measured from the 69k peak and you compare the current cycle the screen line with the prior two cycles it's notable just how much above the last two cycles we actually are right now um in fact as measured from the peak the last two cycles of course it happens to line up with the uh you know with the pandemic drop but even if you just sort of fast forward out of that you can see by day 850 those two cycles those two prior Cycles were still 65% down from their highs which is I mean that's substantial I mean a 65% down from the high is is quite a substantial um level to be at considering right now we're not that far away right I mean we're you know we're at 52k the highs are of course in the 60s it I mean it does show to some degree that we are ahead of where we were at the same time last cycle and it and it's kind of reminiscent to me um if we don't even look at this cycle how the cycle before this one there were periods where we got well ahead of that prior of the cycle before that one right there's there's two key areas where it happened right the 2019 rally that sort of faded once the rate Cuts finally arrived and then we had another rally later on this was you know after all the money printing all the trillions printed and and and of course all the um you know all the major buys by you know by micro strategy and and and sort of and even you know Elon Musk at Tesla they they bought um Bitcoin over here and so you can see that we certainly get ahead of where we can we can get ahead of where we were in a prior cycle that that happened last cycle so kind of seems like we're doing something similar once again where we are um and again it's it's really it's really impossible to predict exactly where there will be a pullback the thing that I would remind people of um is that this pullback here in 2019 that finally occurred was after you know or as it was before the First Rate cut but also it was after the uh the Bitcoin dominance retrace back to the 0. five FIB um right and that's still you know that's still a little bit higher than where we are right now that's about 56% % and and you know I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on on the dominance because I mean it's been in a macro uptrend forever we've had some pullbacks along the way it seems like we're in one of those pullbacks right now yeah let me just bring up the dominance chart on mine and just see I just have some old trend lines that I've been watching kind of interesting here because again I don't even know if I've looked at this chart since we talked a week ago um and you can see the lines I had in here um and it's interesting because if if I just extend them out look at what we just hit on dominance right here and then you can see we kind of bubbled up and then tried it tried to break out here and then it kind of got rejected so you know just something to to take a look at on that but if you zoom out and and what you always want to do at least what I do is is if the short term and this is just zooming in on the daily dominance chart what it looks to me is like a lot of chop right a lot of chop but if you go to your weekly chart it gives you a much better bigger term View and again for me I'm seeing like where is dominance running into resistance well there's a clear area right under here where if we draw that trend line through that that's your area that it keeps bubbling up against if we can break through this like 54 55% level it looks like it's clear sailing to about 57 or so right up here so again just interesting to see that but one thing I wanted to Pivot to is is I was just looking at a couple different charts is is um you know does it bother you that this is a by the way this is a chart of Bitcoin versus the S&P 500 and does it bother you at all with Bitcoin that the S&P is making new all-time Highs but Bitcoin hasn't or is it just because Bitcoin is much more more volatile um of a of an IND you know of a of an asset class yeah no it doesn't really bother me because it's actually it's actually quite in line with what happened last like late business cycle QT you know before lower interest rates came I mean like last cycle if you look at the S&P 500 I mean we were making all-time highs a lot sooner than we were this cycle you know after that after that sort of that you know midterm year drop right 2018 had a pretty big drop in the S&P 500 just like 2022 did you can see that in 2018 we got to new highs really by about April of the the pre-election year this time it took us all the way until basically the end of the pre-election year um or maybe or early this year I don't remember exactly the day that it happened but um and you can see that while the S&P was making new highs Bitcoin was not right I mean it was it was pretty clear over here that Bitcoin was not and it took Bitcoin really until that pivot to loer monetary policy actually occurred that it was able to make that larger move um to the upside that's not to say that it can't do it I mean we're more connected now to traditional Finance I think because of spot ETFs um than we were back then so that might be something to keep in mind but um it's not really that surprising that that Bitcoin hasn't done it yet again last cycle it didn't it didn't make that move until after looser monetary policy arrived we are actually got pretty close right I mean we ried all the way up to like 14k and the highs back then were 20K but we did you know we didn't actually make it there until until that shift to loose monetary policy arrived there's another chart by the way Gareth that you know it's not I used to look I used to enjoy looking at it more until they actually changed the definition of M1 but if you look at like you know Bitcoin divided by M1 um you know there there was this 2019 rally over here and again it's funny because we always when we think about like you know the last Bull Run we think about 2021 and a lot of people don't really think about 2019 but when you account for M1 um you can see that the 2019 rally was was you know about as about as impressive they did though change the definition of it somewhere over here but despite that I don't know if it's a coincidence or not that was sort of the same level still yeah still interestingly how it works out that way maybe maybe looking at it with respect to M2 is is a better way to look at it um I mean you can see that last cycle there was a pretty big rally um by Bitcoin we cooled off a little bit around rate cuts and then we got another move up on the other side of rate cut so maybe something like that is is is playing out interesting interesting pivoting over to eth here I just wanted to show a chart here that I find fascinating is that you know basically eth has has had this up channel that we've been stuck in since 2022 right we hit the high we came down to the low didn't quite get to the high here came down to the low then hit the high here and had that pullback and then interestingly enough we did break out above this line here and then it back tested you could see two two candles here piercing this line but it held and we have seen it move up and so you know you know I think the big question is is is this is this money rotation I mean Bitcoin obviously is kind of stalled out here um some alts by the way I find it interesting there's certain alts that are making shortterm highs um and then other alts kind of have been left behind a little bit like I was looking at um a chart of of uh like inj which TR is trying to move back up but it's still off of its Highs but yeah I mean I'm just curious about your thoughts on where ethereum is headed in the near term here yeah I'd always you know I'd first look at at say like the eth Bitcoin pair um to see what that's looking like and you know I'm still I'm still somewhat stubbornly under the impression that it's probably just repeating these same sort of structures that we've seen in the past right where you you you put in these lows and then eventually you breakdown from it but there is there are bounces that occur off the lows right there's like you know a pretty big bounce here and actually if you look at the last cycle right if you look at sort of the last cycle by eth Bitcoin after getting this bounce we sort of came all the way up just like we did right here we actually came back down below the 20we SMA and then got a bounce in February right which is kind of what's Happening Now I would look probably for eth Bitcoin to you know to not go too much higher I mean it it could certainly go a little bit higher or here but I still think that that that liquidity will flow back to bitcoin um eventually especially as we get closer to the having so and again that goes back to the whole Bitcoin dominant stuff I do think that it has taken a bit of a hit recently um but I wouldn't be surprised to see it it it go look at this look at here's another way to look at dominance kind of looks like maybe it's in sort of an ascending triangle here Y where it's you know put in a low put in a higher low and it's it's really struggling to break above that 54% level so I think if you get a weekly close above 54% then you're then you could very quickly move to those levels that you mentioned but as far as as far as eusd I I just talked about this somewhat recently on my channel I'm you know it's interesting because there's there's certainly two different ways to look at it you can look at it through sort of like the cyclical view of eth um you know which is basically looking at the same chart but instead of looking at it for Bitcoin you look at it for ethereum and you kind of see all right we're we're basically doing what we've historically done we've had you know diminish volatility uh to the downside if you look at it in terms of monetary policy what's fascinating is that this move over here is essentially a 10% move of this one right so like look at this like that's an 84 this is about 10x higher right and then the second the secondary tap of that ascending wedge was about 104 here it was about a thousand um and then the third tag of that trend line was about 150 over here believe it or not it was, 1500 um and then it we broke through the trend line right we break through it go up to about 270 280 just like we did here we got a pull back to 220 to 230 just like we got went to 2200 to 2300 there and then we finally got a blowoff top all the way up to a weekly close of around 300 with a wick up to around the 360s um and and of course what's fascinating about all that is it occurred going into those First Rate Cuts right it occurred going into those First Rate Cuts so I'd be curious if it if it plays out like that here in the not sistant future where you know eth continues to show short-term strength against you know Bitcoin but then as you get closer to the having you get March and April Bitcoin takes over eth Bitcoin goes back down to the m lows and then you get some type of unversioned the yield curve as the FED cuts and then you see ethusd uh fade back down until we get sufficiently back to quantitative easing interesting interesting yeah speaking of like the economy I I think couple things stood out in the past week for me so we saw the CPI and PPI numbers coming out pretty strong right they were hotter than expected and it kind of threw the market for a loop which you know up until about a month ago we we were hearing that oh six rate Cuts then it was five I think it's actually down to two three to four now is what's expected but but I think that was something that stood out to me because then it opens the door to the potential that the FED won't be able to ease as much as the market wants if inflation is not coming down towards 2% right so that's a negative for risk assets number two retail sales right we know the backbone of the US economy is the consumer and retail sales came in really weak and one thing I just want to give everyone a heads up on is tomorrow morning Tuesday Morning Walmart and I believe it's Home Depot report earnings and that will give us some color on you know is it just a fluke that retail sales were weak weaker than expected or is there something more going on with the consumer in the US economy and I'm still in the camp where like I still think that the the crypto markets are influenced by risk assets meaning that if the stock market's going up generally crypto probably Trends up because there's more money being created one chart I just wanted to show you guys here I think this is a super interesting one is this is the this is basically the stock market versus GDP and we have now made a new high in terms of valuations in the stock market versus GDP down here and it's just you know again these type of charts are important you're now at such a massive amount I think it's about a 50 trillion almost 51 trillion in stock market market cap in this country uh versus GDP which is much much lower obviously so little things like this start to get my attention in terms of is the stock market overvalued are we at risk of a potential bubble um you know one of the other charts to show is smci this was an incredible move I mean something that was trending on Twitter because it was so insane by the way when it started trending on Twitter on Friday morning that was that actually the top and so just for everyone out there watch that I use that as a personal indicator it's not the only indicator it doesn't determine if I short or go long but but this fall was insane 30% from the opening highs basically in one day to the downside but look at that move I mean that was parabolic it looked like a crypto like it looked like a meme meme chart to me it definitely did so so I guess my point is is that I'm continuing to watch the stock market I'm continuing to watch signals like this just because I do think it influences the crypto markets if we did see a big riskof situation in the stock market yeah Nvidia earnings are this week right I think they're on yeah Wednesday after the close yep absolutely I know some people have uh made the comparison of Nvidia to Cisco from the dotom I mean the dot when when Cisco when the Cisco bubble finally popped uh and by the way I think uh markets are expecting an 11% move from Nvidia I think that's what options are pricing in which is kind of funny because the last two earnings I think Nvidia ended up being relatively flat um but yeah I mean I think uh Cisco didn't actually start to break down until March of 2000 I believe it was March where it finally started to show some weakness so I mean if if if Nvidia um I don't know which way it's going to break after earnings but I mean if it if it breaks up then maybe you just kick the can down the road another month or something I I don't know as far sometimes sometimes when when a company reports it the final accumulation of buyers and stopping out the last few shorts that will be and then that's actually the top you actually get this kind of blowoff top effect but you're right this is the Cisco chart here guys and but you know Ben you're bringing up a good point is Cisco's never gotten back to those all-time highs that it hit in the dotc era and I know people today a lot of the younger Generations you know it's like oh well what's Cisco it's not even that big of a company anymore well this was this was like the equivalent of the AI narrative for stocks is what Cisco was it was the backbone of the internet and the internet was just becoming a mainstream thing at the time and this was the only game in town Cisco was really the only game in town for the backbone of the internet so it was the equivalent of the AI chips that that Nvidia is putting out right now and that's why you know it's good to draw these types of comparisons um you've had bubbles along the way in fact I I was going over this with with other groups and talking about how you know every so often you have these parabolic moves we had them in the the marijuana stocks we've had them in the crypto markets we've had them in the Solar stocks and and ultimately when the blowoff doeses occur it's a big drop I mean these these things really do collapse and if we just take a look at the Nvidia chart very very eerily similar in terms of looking at that chart and and and some of these past bubble blowoff and again there'll be lots of naysayers they'll say oh it's different it's different this time I've heard that for every bubble though can you go back to the Cisco chart for a second absolutely one one thing that's I I and yeah like one thing that's super interesting about it is like imagine that bubble in 1998 to 200000 just didn't happen like and the chart just slowly trended up it the the sentiment around the stock would be completely different you know yeah it's just that because that bubble existed um you know right there I think sort of a lot of people compare it to that high but otherwise it's basically just been trending up for the last 20 years so you know as as as far as Nvidia goes my my thoughts are that like yeah like I mean AI is probably going to be something that completely changes Our Lives over the next 20 years I don't think anyone's disputing that it's just that when you get these types of moves it's basically pricing in you know Perfection for the next 10 years and there's going to be competition to Nvidia um I I I I think that well right now the margins margins for NVIDIA are like 80% and there's no way with I mean already AMD is coming out with chips and like all these other players they're all racing and by the way China we're we're we're kind of banning some of these chips from going to China so China's like on the fast track to produce a bunch of these chips themselves at some point it becomes commoditized I think I think andin will fall off a cliff that's what happened with Cisco is they and I mean that was why a lot of what they offered did that that's what happened and then the valuations fell quite a bit so yeah I mean like that's probably what's going to happen I I think the hard part is no one knows where the high you know no one knows where the Top's going to be no um and I don't there's no really rational way to predict exactly I mean look at the Cisco chart who would have known that that was exactly where it was going to finally top out in March of 2000 you know there impossible to know if that was the level no it's and it's and you're right and you know it's it's I I honestly thought the top on Nvidia was months ago if not more and it's it's defied gravity and continued to push up um part of that I think is liquidity and I think it's just it's just we've gotten into this Market very similar to 2021 where people aren't really questioning valuation they're not thinking ahead it's just like hey throw money in because it just makes money money in the market makes money which again to me is a little bit of a warning sign doesn't mean the top is next week or next month but it's just like these are red flags that are starting to be be in the market that investors probably should be aware of I'm curious what are your thoughts about I mean because like an individual stock right I mean Nvidia I mean obviously if Nvidia were to collapse like it would take the stock market with it but yeah you know to a certain degree I that the stock market is still much bigger than Nvidia so I'm curious you know one of the things that has been discussed for the last couple of years and is always discussed really during aggressive rate hiking Cycles is whether the FED will achieve a soft Landing or a hard Landing or no Landing um and I'm I'm curious where you stand on that like what do you think the risks like what are the risks of a soft Landing one of the risks of a hard Landing what would you be looking for to look for confirmation of either one yeah so so one thing just and I'll just show this real quick first this is kind of one of those freaky trend lines that that people should be aware of this was the high of the q's the NASDAQ 100 at the.com bubble High look at what we hit in 2022 and look at where we currently are right now so again doesn't mean doesn't mean it's the high of course as we all know but you know you just look for these little things that can give you a little insights into the charts but for me when it's looking at like you know potentially whether it's a soft Landing or not you have to look at the labor market right so labor Market's probably the number one thing so far that's held up but I would like to just point out and let me just try to go to this chart here I don't have it pre-prepared but if you look at U6 U6 on employment U6 has started to actually pop up a little bit here um let me just get rid of these and what I've noticed is that U6 is the leading indicator for recessions meaning that the the overall employment rate doesn't change for those of you guys out there that don't know what U6 is it basically gives you it's it's underemployed right so it's someone that wants a full-time job but they can't find it so they take part-time work and and the concept behind that is that initially a company will also say Hey listen we can't keep you on full-time because things are slowing down but we'll keep you on part-time and so these are people again this is a more accurate view of underemployed which can be a leading indicator because that before a company fires someone they often times would say oh well we can't keep you on but we'll keep you on part-time and if you look at this even though the labor the unemployment rate hasn't fully started to pop up we have seen U6 back in in 2000 before the 2002 recession U6 spent about 12 months going up before it hit the recession and if you go to 2007 same thing 12 months of up ticking in the U6 before the the Great Recession and then even in I mean covid was a little bit of a Black Swan no one necessarily anticipated it but even there you saw a little bit of an uptick first and if you go here right if we just zoom in let's just do the one year this is very clear that U6 is starting to Incline so to me that's an indicator that a recession is probably coming even if the unemployment rate itself isn't showing us that or or the the uh the hirings the other thing is I think the consumer we talked about it earlier right the the retail sales if this economy is going to continue to be what it is the the consumer has to keep spending and I do wonder how much the consumer can do it when you see the retail sales weaker we see credit card debt north of 1.1 trillion now um there seems like a lot of pressure on the consumer now starting to kind of develop and at some point there'll be a breaking point so uh what about you what are your thoughts on on this stuff yeah well I me the consumer I you know looking at prior business Cycles the consumer can definitely stay stronger for I think longer than a lot of people think um and I I think there's been a lot of you know with all the money Printing and whatnot a lot of consumers you know they they've they've had some cash saved up up but as inflation continues to stay really elevated all that slowly comes back down right you know back down to historical lower levels um yeah you know it's interesting when you when you s when you were showing that chart about like the unemployment rate uh or the U6 and how there was like 12 months of like a slow uptrend yeah like pull it back up um I I think you know if you think back to like those Cycles imagine you were someone living through that cycle and seeing it go up but not really seeing the sort of the the larger move up right right it can be exhausting right you know sort of waiting for that Trend to actually occur and you know I don't think anyone wants to see people get laid off it's just this is kind of what happens during aggressive R and Cycles by the FED I mean I would prefer for everyone keeps their job and I I think the thing is is like look this is a risk just start preparing for it that like you know maybe prepare maybe plan out for how you how you would you know navigate a scenario if it were to eventually end in the same way that the other business Cycles end it um yeah and and and I would just point out too it's you know there's there's so many Eerie similarities and again similarities don't dictate future results but you know whether it's Jerome Powell saying exactly what Ben banki said in 2007 that we're going to avoid a recession or you know there's just there's just Eerie similarities about this stuff and then you look at like the US deficit you know the debt levels how how much higher we are in so many of these metrics but at the same time you look at money supply and money supply and liquidity in the system has also increased you know substantially which you could argue as creating or helping elongate the bull cycle right the the longer the growth cycle but we we ultimately and this is the scary thing about it is I've often delved into this thought is would our overall economy in the long run be better with no fed intervention or with fed intervention because I've always argued that with the FED intervening they keep the bull market and the growth longer but you don't get the natural recourse of the Cy which is the the recession period um and then when you get it it's 20 times worse like what we saw in 07 or 0809 and so I you know what are your thoughts on that like like do you think the FED over the long term has helped or is it potentially that they've just been creating I mean it seems like they helped because the the economy's done better but do we have to pay the price at some point well I mean I think it certainly makes speculation more dubious I mean like it's not like you know ra rather than looking at like um you know some of the metrics that like the like the prior generation looked at more frequently like like price to earnings and all that stuff a lot of people in our generation I feel like don't even care about that stuff it's all about you know um sort of riding the momentum all the look I I think that there have been periods where it was appropriate um you know for them to do something but I also think that over the last few years they went far above and beyond what they needed to do I mean I think in in 2021 when it was clear that the economy was heating up and did did not really need them to continue to expand their balance sheet right they should have stopped then and they should have started raising interest rates then rather than waiting until 2022 I mean of course it's easy in hindsight um to say that but it is something to consider and by the way um like here's some charts like there's plenty of charts that show the labor market slowly softening up uh this is like new hires in the manufacturing sector right it's dropping a lot uh one of the ones that I I think was a little concerning was the average hourly earning or sorry no average hour work per week um had a pretty big drop actually uh the last the last report um down to 34.1 which is not what essentially happens I think in the in the cycle is that the first thing that companies do is they they reduce hours right they reduce people's hours before they lay them off because think back U6 what I was mentioning in the U6 right well it's so hard it's so hard to find good workers I think that's been you know that was something that's been challenging or that's been a challenge for businesses for several years is that it's really hard to find you know a a good worker and they don't want you know the the the ones that they have they don't want to fire them and then have them go off to their competition and start working right so what they do first is they reduce hours right they reduce hours um that's a pretty common tactic eventually If the Fed doesn't pivot you know soon then they have to start going over to to layoffs right but I I think look you know when it comes to the labor market and and you know there's a couple things you can look at one of which is what you were just showing the U6 we know that it takes a year or more for it to slowly turn up right so in that in that time or sort of in that regard it's not really different right I mean we've seen it take a long time before another way to look at it is to look at say the number of job openings per unemployed worker and see like it's come down a lot from over two openings per unemployed worker to where it is now it's at 1.4 44x but a lot of this I think was just getting rid of a lot of the excess that was created post pandemic yeah so I I think the hard part is will the FED actually start to cut rates before this continues to you know to crash down and as as long as inflation remains at 3% I I I kind of think the fed's hands are are still somewhat tied yeah I agree I agree I think that's a wonderful way to end it I mean pretty intense discussion today folks I hope you guys enjoyed it and the data out there and and as always guys follow everything Ben does he's freaking awesome um yeah I would love to work more with him and figure out other things so we'll talk a little bit about that more and more but he's awesome guys and and check out everything from his socials to his service out there same thing with Gareth uh you know Gareth has um a great website great socials and you know I mean I one of the things about Gareth and I know we've talked about this before is you know like back during 2021 especially you know really early on or you know I think like what like October November but also you were raised in the warning signs earlier as well um you know I mean like it's the market the market can go on and on and on right for a long time and and still stay at those Highs but eventually eventually these risks sort of manifest and I mean I think Gare did a great job of last cycle kind of warning people about that and saying look guys you know I know I know everyone wants Bitcoin to go to 300K but you know maybe that's not going to happen uh just yet so again like I I think we're all longterm uh we want to see absolutely we want to see bit do well over the long term and I think we we we all think it will um but yeah like there's certainly risks that we have to consider in the in the meantime uh yeah make sure you guys go follow Gareth he puts out a lot of a lot of content and um I think we'll wrap it up there and we'll see you guys a week from today awesome have a great one guys thanks for tuning in take care",Youtube video,2024-02-19 00:00:00,"Refined and Expanded Summary:The summary provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of the cryptocurrency market, particularly focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The analysts note that Bitcoin is currently trading around $52,000 and has broken above the previous spot ETF highs, but they anticipate a potential pullback in the short term, with $49,000 being a key support level to watch. They also observe that Ethereum has been outperforming Bitcoin recently, breaking out of a consolidation channel, which could be a sign of money rotation between the two assets.The analysts also discuss the relationship between the stock market and the cryptocurrency market, noting that the S&P 500 has been making new all-time highs while Bitcoin has not. They attribute this to the timing of the shift in monetary policy, suggesting that Bitcoin may not make a significant move until after the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, similar to what happened in the previous cycle.Furthermore, the analysts express concerns about the potential for a market downturn, citing factors such as the recent hot inflation data, weak retail sales, and the parabolic move in the SMCI index, which they compare to a meme chart in the crypto market. They also draw parallels between the current situation in the stock market and the dot-com bubble, particularly with regards to Nvidia's earnings and the potential for a similar collapse.The summary also highlights the analysts' cautious and somewhat bearish sentiment, as they suggest that various technical and macroeconomic factors could potentially lead to a market correction or a more challenging environment for cryptocurrencies and risk assets in the near future. The analysts emphasize the importance of preparing for potential scenarios, as they believe the current economic conditions bear eerie similarities to past business cycles that have resulted in recessions.Overall, the refined and expanded summary provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the cryptocurrency market, while also considering the broader macroeconomic factors that could impact the performance of digital assets and the overall financial markets.",389,"[0.05923462, 0.031677246, 0.0033302307, -0.02305603, 0.02418518, -0.025177002, 0.038757324, -0.049865723,

spill over into crypto the having is coming up relatively soon and I also want to talk a little bit about the um the the it doesn't seem like it's generating as much hype as the Bitcoin ETF but there is some chatter about the eth ETF which could be coming up here in a few months and then and we'll talk about some um everyone's favorite topic right all the new projects that you guys are are getting into uh so let's go ahead and jump in um Bitcoin took out the recent highs right from the Spy DTF launch and you know do you think I'm curious like do you think it's going to give people more confidence sort of jump into that because I know a lot of people thought like it might be this a sell the news event and it was in the short term right like we dropped 20% but still a fairly typical correction that Bitcoin has had when you look at all prior Corrections from 2023 so do you think that this has given investors more confidence in in sort of the launch of these spot ETFs and also I'm curious um and Jessica we'll start with you first I'm curious if you think that um some of the institutions that did not list the ETS I think was was Vanguard one of them um I can't remember but there there were some institutions that decided not to list ETF I'm wondering do you think that given the success of this launch maybe they'll be compelled to to list it in the future so as to not lose clients what are your thoughts not lose out on a slice of the pie a piece of the pie I think a lot I was really surprised on just the appetite that we have seen this week alone so just for context as well so we had in the last four weeks we had a huge amount of inflows coming in $42,000 42,000 BTC of inflows in the first 20 days of trading the last 4 days 43,000 BTC of inflows so the appetite has been huge I think it was Anthony Pompano was speaking on CNBC this week and he was saying there's 12.5x more demand for Bitcoin that's what's being produced on a daily basis and if we look at what the ETF issue is we're talking about and the discussion around opening this up to Institutions and the appetite we had a huge surge of even price Wars among the BTC ETF issuers that we had seen so Black Rock and everyone was really putting their CS onto the table so it's a really interesting time that we have seen the first round of appetite coming through we've seen now the demand coming through black rock is the PowerHouse leader $5.4 billion do in assets 105,000 BTC that they've got it's like it's an absolute force to be reckoned with and we did see that Trad five funds were looking to wait and analyze the appetite and risk before get getting involved uh so actually Nick from coin buau had put a post on the coin buau Discord which was highlighting a Bloomberg article that came out on the 12th of February and this was to do with LPL Financial and they have more than $1 trillion dollars of assets and capital under management and they as you said Ben they wanted to wait and see how the appetite was see if it would work in the market really analyze the risk versus reward before they looked at allowing the ETFs and brokerage onto their platform and this is a really good entry point they have over 177,000 financial advisers working for them so this is going to be another potential spill of a game changer of kind of retail adoption and Retail brokerage getting into the spot Bitcoin ETF rapper and Bitcoin entering the space so I do think this is still a wait and see I think this has restored a lot of confidence within the tradire institutional space um and it's going to be interesting to see how the next few few months play play out seems like such a risk for you know some of the institutions to delay it especially when often times you know it's the ones that are able to accumulate the most volume that end up going on to be the ones that actually stick around for the Long Haul so we'll see if it I mean it's certainly a risky play by them we'll see if it how that how that pays off in the end yeah Rob what do you I mean you have anything to add to to that I mean what do you think about us taking out the recent highs and also some of these institutions not listing these ETS poti not behind yeah well first it was well very well said Jessica that's why we love you on the show because you always bring great insights and fantastic data points so I appreciate that that's for sure but uh just to piggyback on what you said and Ben if you could uh let me throw up my screen real quick it'll be kind of like a just a little embellishment of what uh Jess talked about but um as far as like inflows yeah same you didn't share it yet hold on actually I'll just wing it then if I can't Ah that's why because it disappeared okay ah okay are you I should be better at this actually yeah all right so let's see so yeah just like what she what Jessica were you saying you know there's in there's we're still positive uh inflows even though gray scale has been dumping we can take a look at that graphically it looks like this gray scale is the big contributor of the negativity but then also I I think there's something to be said for this is from crypto zombie and I didn't know this was actually happening but it looks like people are getting out of the gold ETFs and either they're getting out for whatever reason you know I'm not going to say they're going directly into the spot Bitcoin ETFs but like someone said they were in gold for decades and they said you know in the last uh month Bitcoin has the price appreciation has dwarfed it than what gold has done over two years so I personally own precious metals as well gold and silver so I can understand the point of where they're coming from but on the positive is also a little bit of negativity coming around the Ben I guess Genesis just got a court approval to sell 1.6 billion in Crypt trust shares so that's like gray scale two essentially but again if we to what Jessica was talking about even though grayscale dumps a ton because that's just what they have they have the cancer within them what is FTX and their shares uh 1.6 billion isn't too bad it just going to be a little bit of a price action I think we can absorb that quite easily but we'll see how it goes and then of course absorb that right with your own dcas right that's true so it's a but it's very difficult to do that on my credit cards because I have a high APR but besides that yeah not too bad but again uh I think PM said it and Jess said it there as far as demand there's 900 new Bitcoins being issued per day and if we took a look at 900 Bitcoin uh the price today that's 47 million and right now for the uh inflows every day what do we got whoops we've got uh billions actually today actually yesterday Valentine's Day it was 3 39 so as far as like a million so that's like what a 7x 8X somewhere around there so I'll take those numbers I think we're in the right place at the right time especially the people that have stuck around so congratulations everybody yeah for sure I mean it's the the recent new push is definitely um improved sentiment I think um what are I mean we only have let me let me skip to the next question we we'll come back the having is only a couple months from now right I mean what like a little over 60 days maybe like around 60 days 70 days something like that I don't know exactly um it's like 57 roughly oh okay so it's speeding up yeah I mean it's always you know it's sort of a function of of all the um of it's not a set it's not something that's set in still and it obviously can change but it's only a couple months away maybe less than a couple months away as Jessica said do you think think this is going to increase or correspond to an increase in interest in the space because I mean I don't know about you guys but like when I look at the social statistics compared to like now compared to 2021 there's not there's still not the same level of of retail interest right as there was back then um if you just look at like viewership uh across channels I mean if you look at a coin Bureau of course is one of the best ones to maintaining those views but I mean a lot of a lot of channels have have really come down in viewership um so I'm curious if you think that having will will have some impact um into that and um because I yeah as I said I just it's it's interesting that they haven't really really returned yet I mean I guess we could also ask you think that uh that that price will will continue higher but I won't put you guys on the spot for that I just more more more you know pointedly do you think there will be more interest coming back into the cryptoverse over the next two months as we go into the having Rob ah sure sounds good actually I was I was waiting for Jess's answer because she's been Jessica I think you've been been here longer than us I think that you've been in since like 2013 2014 somewhere around there 2015 so I've had one or two halvings under my under my belt but you can take it away I'll I'll follow through sure yeah so I mean if we look at if you go to Google Trends and we can take a look at just the popularity of just Bitcoin itself it's almost kind of like it's almost almost like you can overp put the price of Bitcoin just like the M2 money supply and if we take a look at it um from the having years and this for Google Trends it's not so everybody knows Google Trends is not the amount of uh unique searches per month it's just interest over time so it rates it zero to 100 and like in the in the the time frame from the last or the having having 2016 uh we can see that it really doesn't do much uh until we actually have a having and then of course uh as the price appreciates so we can see that it actually the having did some good parts as far as interest people searching for it which would be retail but it really didn't do much until we hit 2017 and then it went off the off the rail as we hit the all-time highs same thing for 2020 looks like I think it was in May 11 somewhere around there so yeah we peaked out for the interest but when did it really go up of course towards the end when we were seeing price appreciation and Elon Musk gets into it if we take a look at the last 10 years this is interest over time so I know people talk about I mean I talk about a lot I mean as far as like uh price of or interest but the interests I think the Smart Ones understand that having brings price appreciation that's when people start to search I think just like it has almost always been people are interested in it and you guys get the text messages people who are watching this video they get the the the the questions like should I get into Bitcoin now well you should have actually done this about a year ago but I guess the worst time is never so uh I still say that having has great price appreciation retail will come in as soon as it goes off the rails and it's on MSNBC and CNBC and everywhere else constantly but right now I think we're front running a lot of people sounds good Jessica what do you think yeah absolutely agree so just to kind of kind of Pop onto the back of that I think what we have seen in the past few months with trafi media is we have seen quite a lot of coverage of Bitcoin just because The Narrative of the big asset managers like Black Rock and the listings of the spot Bitcoin ETF has seen crypto in the news more than we would expect normally it was a little bit of a narrative preing and on the kind of date of the haling if there was a huge fud topic that would get crypto coverage or a big price dip or gain so price volatility that was when you would see Bitcoin in CNBC or in kind of Bloomberg and the likes there um therefore so we are going to see some coverage beforehand but just as Rob said it's not going to be the kind of thing that will'll get the new retail investors that will only come through after typically it's 12 to 18 months after is when we really see the price gains on the back of that there was quite a lot of live streams within the crypto industry last Bitcoin havving but that was as Rob mentioned 12th of May so it was everyone locked down at homes not much else to talk about apart from the Bitcoin haling there was no parties online so you had to do the live streams to sync up and see what people are talking about um and how things are going to move forward but when it comes to retail interest you're right I don't think we are fully there yet when it comes to trading volumes from new investors demand and interest that's not going to be something that we see until the price starts to go up a little bit more and people start getting their ears spiked up I like to have the uh the electrician indicator so I have an electrician in the UK who I actually can pay in crypto he is full dgen and has been in crypto since around 2017 but he will send me WhatsApp screenshots of his clients that will ask him about crypto so this is my electrician indicator with the UK and the UK retail market and the appetite for for crypto from newbies getting in the space so this week we had one person ask about crypto markets are up but the rest of this month we didn't have anything come through and also in January so as things start to pick up I.E price then the retail will will follow soon I did I remember doing a live stream on the having and then like I was looking at a chart or something and then I missed it like when it actually occurred and we were like you missed it but yeah no it's I do remember that like I mean every everyone was locked down and and I mean everyone was just online watching um watching the crypto charts and it was a crazy time back then um I'm curious they I don't know if you guys how how much you're following sort of um what's going on over in traditional markets but like the in in the AI space um you know we've had Nvidia we've had super micro computer I mean I mean just looking at at the charts for for smci like I mean it's it's absolutely insanee how how much it's gone up in such a short period of time um I I think that yeah I mean like like some of these stocks are up like you know 200% or so in the last month I mean smci is up 170% in the last month so I mean it certainly seems like there's been a lot of hype in the AI space and I know you guys are a little bit more well versed in in the altcoin market um and so I'm curious like do you guys think that the hype over in in sort of the traditional markets in AI could that spill over into the crypto space and more specifically perhaps the crypto space that has sort of an AI spin on it do you guys think that that that is or is it already happening Jessica what do you think I I think it's already happening to a certain extent so first of all you're absolutely right we have seen AI stocks are trading almost as good as dgen mem coins it's been some pretty impressive price fluctuations and moves but if we look back there was singularity.net which is a AI ecosystem decentralized AI Marketplace by Benjamin Gil and in the crypto boom of 2017 that Ico raised $ 36 million in 60 seconds so it wasn't the largest Ico on record but it was C certainly the fastest raise so there has always been a little bit of an appeal for an AI narrative as something that's quite catchy and Jazzy obviously with the surge of chat gbt that came last year AI was really a narrative and Nvidia people could really sink their teeth into um and the landscape now if you look at coin market cap and you go on the metrics of AI and Big Data it's a market cap of 29.8 billion dollars as of today so it's just you know it's a force to be reckoned with and I do think the I the AI boom and like kind of price bubble will last a little bit longer over a time span just because the developments within AI projects and platforms do take so long to come through you've still got a few years for all the Innovative AI companies to put things into fruition and then a few more years for the average person to really get on board and adopt them so the kind of the life cycle of those compared to a crypto narrative might be longer so it's kind of it's a little bit harder to determine but one thing I would say is it's definitely more accessible for retail investors to get involved involved in AI tokens and tokens that have a sub AI narrative than something to do with like AI stocks and Nvidia Microsoft these are already companies that are worth trillions of dollars so a smaller AI cap crypto definitely is something that you could look at it and similar to when you look at a smaller cap token and go oh well what if it goes to $1 a token that's really appealing to you as an investor um we saw some pretty big all-time highs from the likes of um injective which was the 26th of December mber Nea Renda was the 27th of December and then ICP after the launch obviously dipped in price and then they had the fourth of January was their all-time high so that was a kind of a smaller all-time high Market top um but I do think moving on to this year 2024 AI tokens are definitely going to have a longer narrative and we actually covered aash Network on the coin Bureau club uh a few weeks ago so for anyone that's interested in that they announced a partnership this week there was some interesting price movements there but AI projects are definitely one that I am keeping an eye out on and actually I spoke to Arthur Hayes this week and that'll be published on coin bureau's main channel on Saturday and we referenced I don't know if you guys remember the EOS Ico that raised $4 billion dollar in 2017 you know that was just like absolutely mindblowing that was kind of marketing genius in their regards and I said to him you know are we going to see a 2024 EOS an equivalent and what would that look like and he was saying that it would be in his eyes something that has AI in the buzzword something that everyone says you know what this is going to change how we work how everything operates everyone has to get involved so he's also betting on the narrative as being something that people will throw money into speaking of EOS since uh since 2018 EOS is down 99.4% % against Bitcoin it's insane how how that how that stuff happens because like what happens is like yeah like they raise money at like yeah really in really hyped up times right and then it's hard to live up to the hype is is I think what often happens it's hard to live up to it so hopefully the people that get in you know sort of early into these things can actually ride that wave you don't want to be the person you know buying at at the you know at the extreme top but um great I think it was a great perspective thanks for that um and I think you're right I mean I think it will probably spill over into the crypto space at some point Rob what do you think I are you on the same page there oh yeah I mean it's it's just easy like Jess just she I remember this I remember when EOS came out and everybody was talking about it Dan larer from bitshares and he was like the the Mad genius he was gonna make things work perfectly and then I think some of the people in the organization they had there was if you guys do a Google search for the EOS million doll bet one of the guys actually bet his co-workers that EOS would be in the top 10 or top five or flip something and he's like I'll bet you a million dollars and of course didn't happen and of course he had to pay up but he didn't pay everything and it was just it was in that time when like if you talked about selling any of your crypto you were attacked you were said what are you doing why why you have such paper hands why you so weak you should have Diamond hands and you should hold forever and it's a prime example of why like the same things happen over and over again and the same thing going to happen this time as well so like EOS you I I should say I I can't say anybody else I should have got rid of that nonsense a long time ago and I didn't and then I wrote it all the way up and I'm like I'm a genius and what do you do you write it all the way back down and it's that's a it's like a thing that that happens over and over and over again so like just like Jessica said the do com era is a great example of like say like Ai and in the.com Era you could do and there was an article it talked about how if you put com next to your next to your business name as far as like like the ticker or for the information you were guaranteed almost 74% increase from the stock price itself so the same thing is going on right now if you look at I here I want to sh so this kind of reminds everybody as they go into this next Bull Run what I'm talking about I want you to take a look at this chart and I want you to tell me if this is a good project because you're looking at right here this is just not too long October 24th 2023 00007 and then just did this and then did this and now you're almost you're a fraction of Penny I think you're a I don't know how many percentage points that you're up you're up M massively and it hasn't come down yet you know what this is this is called Corgi AI it does absolutely nothing that I can figure out and if you take a look if you go over to coin Gecko and go on the categories and put AI it's ranked number 152 what does it do that's anybody's guess but it's got AI next to it so I got to get into it so when we talk about these things just remember that uh a lot of these projects are going to do great in the bull run and uh hopefully you can understand that if you if you write them up make sure you take profits along the way because when you ride down you'll be like everybody else maybe you should change your channel name to uh digital AI news if I did I would I might catch up with you and and maybe coin Bureau but who knows yeah You' Zoom you'd Zoom past us I doubt that that's a good one we'll see there there's some chatter about the you know the the eth ETF um and I mean with with the Bitcoin ETF it seems like that was all anyone could talk about for I don't know like a year or at least six months and and it was approved and I mean I think a lot of people were fairly convinced it would be approved um and it was and so I guess I'm curious you know with the with the ethereum ETF I do see it trending on Twitter occasionally but not as much as I I saw the one for Bitcoin I'm curious you know are we are should we go into the eth ETF with the same type of optimism that it will be approved like the Bitcoin one or do you think that there's you know maybe maybe it'll face more scrutiny than than the Bitcoin ETF and and maybe it's not you know as sure of a thing not to say that it won't ever be approved but maybe they kick the K down the road Rob what do you think about about this I know you were very the Bitcoin and by the way before you I know you I know you thought the Bitcoin would would not be approved but I mean in your defense you had been saying that since like 2017 so I mean like it took seven years Ben you are you are so nice I appreciate that but let's say let's call it spadea Spade I was totally wrong about this one I said that the ETF would not get approved by Marsh and I and I said that but of course I said that you know two years ago when there was chatter about it but I was wrong so I'm not the best person to to to give opinion on this one all only I can point to is this Hester Pierce from you know from the SEC said that uh because of the Bitcoin spot ETF being approved they would use that as precedent to approve potential future ETFs essentially alluding to the ethereum ETF so I have nothing on this one I'll defer to Jessica and what she's got to say Jessica do you have any any insight into the likelihood of ethereum ETF being approved so first of all I was using the poly Market indicator which was a great indicator for the approval for the spot Bitcoin ETF and that was around 93% probability I'm actually going to get you guys to guess the ethereum ETF approved by May the 31st this is a betting on poly market so far there's over a million dollars worth of bets do you guys want to guess the probability of a yes do you want to guess the number I'll let you know if you're close I'm G to say 68% I'll say 45% Ben you're yeah 43% probability of a yes so I there's a few things I first of all if I look back to the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF there was Hester Pierce first came out the day of the approvals and was really outspoken about the kind of discontent with the SEC saying like she doesn't know why it took them this long this is not the job of the SEC they've missed out on generations of product innovators within the space it was unnecessary so on so forth so I think that has left quite a sour taste in the mouth and we'll hopefully get things moving a little bit faster than the 10 years since the winlos twins sent the approval for the first spot Bitcoin ETF there is still the question mark over ethereum as a security if that's going to slow down the approval of a spot ethereum ETF if that's going to step in the way at all but I think if we go back to the first question you asked Ben which is to do with the appetite of inflows that we've seen from the ETF issuers currently and the appetite from the likes of Black Rock what we're seeing from clients there's huge appetite for um kind of Bitcoin in a rapper which is investor Institutional Investor friendly and that'll be the same for ethereum so if we look at the ETF providers that are desperate to get a spot ethereum ETF on the market is the SEC going to be able to go up against them and are they going to be willing to put down the time and effort to I think the first final deadline is the 23rd or 24th of May for the spot ethereum ETF so if that does get declined and they do have to go and move forward and go into court for this are they going to be able to challenge the likes of six money hungry um asset managers that are looking to get a piece of the pie um JP Morgan also said 50% likelihood by the end of this year so I think it's kind of anyone's guess and it will depend a little bit on the the regulatory stance of the SEC when it comes to to the security question mark but I'm not underestimating the power of Black Rock in this one and their appetite based on the positive inflows that they've seen for Bitcoin so far yeah I mean it seems like it should eventually be approved but I I sort of sense that it's not as much of a sure thing as the one for for Bitcoin because I feel like for Bitcoin it was just like it's clearly a commodity right there's no standing for it to be a security with ethereum I mean I still think it probably should be a commodity but but what I think and and what you know what the SE what the SEC thinks are are two very different things so um yeah yeah we'll see and we also we haven't seen so much about it on social media yet because I also think the likes of Eric balunis and James safer the Bloomberg ETF analyst they're also still so busy monitoring the inflows of spot Bitcoin ETFs that that is just still taken up a lot of the narrative that we are seeing now this is a bigger piece of the pie it's more juicy everyone wants to talk about it whereas six months ago it was quite a quiet news few months and the spot ETFs for Bitcoin were the m the main thing that we could focus on and look out so now there's a few more narratives that people can focus on so hopefully you know it just quietly creeps up honors and we get some good news in May yeah hopefully hopefully I wanna I want to pick your guys' brains about some of the new projects in the crypto space I mean I know you guys talking about some of that stuff in the coin Bureau Club did Rob you talk about I I think you talk about like basically every single day on on your channel um so I'd like to give you guys you know the chance to talk about some of your favorite projects in the space um what are some things that have caught your eye recently I know my audience would love to hear you know more information about that side of the market so um Rob what do you got um well for for this one like if we're talking about new new stuff I you know I always thought that The Narrative was you know moving into 2024 25 was going to be you know three-fold which would be web 3 gaming Ai and Dees and then of course the fourth one I see it as deepin decentralized physical infrastructure networks right so when I take a look at that I've I've seen that like on um so like one would be like helium I know people some people love Sal some people despise salana but you can't discount the fact that helium actually has a working product right now you can pay 20 bucks you get unlimited talks texts and data here in the states I don't know if it's Global or not but it looks like a pretty good play and then if we're talking about telecommunications I'm really you know we've been talking about this for a while but as far as like a deepin play It's called World mobile and it's uh built on cardano and they have another one which is going to be like a piggyback called minutes which essentially is it's it's a way to use applications in your phone cut out the middleman to make calls globally and then be able to shift everything through and then you get a piece of that action instead of having to go through a a tertiary method or a third person it's going to be you essentially getting revenue from from calls globally so uh stuff like that and then also for like like the AI plays you know hopefully like hypercycle those pretty well it's one of the things that I've gotten into recently but it makes sense I mean if we're talking about AI uh to build warehouses and get uh computers and nodes and actually the the chips to actually run that and get that that processing power up to speed how difficult is that well just use Gamers uh rigs because they essentially have a supercomputer right there and you can use something like a hypercycle be a node and and go from there but again all this stuff that I just talked about like if you take a look at most of the do era and how well they did 99% are dead so again make sure that you do as much research you possibly can because a lot of these things will go up but they will go down that's uh that's my little warning for everybody gravity has a way of pulling things back down to earth eventually right true yeah and by the way guys if you guys have any questions for either Rob or Jessica leave them in the chat below so that uh we can get to those um after Jessica answers Jessica do you have any any specific projects that you are finding interesting right now yes I do first of all have to agree with Rob with World mobile there as well so I I think I I first interviewed Mickey in 2019 the utility they've been rolling out is kind of deepin physical infrastructure decentralized but before deepin was really a narrative that even had a name I guess and the utility that they have and the examples already as real world use cases are really impressive so for people that are not familiar with World mobile I absolutely recommend them to go and check them out it's it's pretty inspiring actually um when it comes to similar deeper narratives that are maybe a little bit newer and ones that I'm keeping an eye on and have on my watch list there are two within the salana ecosystem so one is Hive mappa which is a Google Street Car alternative um and that incentivizes people to sync up their dash cam they can earn rewards and earn tokens um and then the benefits is it has more kind of upcat revent data than a Google street car view because there's more people on the network contributing um and that has the ticker honey um and then also teleport is one that I'm watching as well so that is a ride sharing app on on salana um and it raised $9 million in seed rening so the ticker is trip and yeah designed for ride sharing for various economies the seed Ram was pretty impressive they had people from Uber representing no crypto is required for onboarding as well which is a really big one I think for the bringing in the next wave of people that don't really know they're using crypto but they they they're getting a faster cheaper service and they're getting incentivized with rewards I think that's going to be the next thing that brings on a new batch of retail users so they're two within the salana ecosystem that I'm keeping an eye out for and there's also one project called Babylon which is on the cosmos ecosystem and this is undergoing its test n on the 26th of February um and it is um BTC holders earning yield by offering non-custodial staking of Bitcoin onto Cosmos so that's like a pretty interesting um ecosystem they're working on Vanek had written out their top 50 crypto narratives for 2024 and they'd given Babylon a shout out myself and some of the coin bu team actually went to go meet some of the founding team for Babylon last week they're here in Dubai and it just seems pretty impressive again it's kind of making Bitcoin a little bit more accessible and incentivizing on different subchains and Nets um and Babylon they'd raised quite a significant amount from the likes of um polygon Capital as well so that's also one I'm keeping an eye out for hey Jess real quick sorry Ben um when when these all these products that you talked about did you guys talk about it on the main Channel some of them or all of them or is that with coin Bureau Club so this is on coin Bureau Club thank you for asking by the way um so we have the coin buau Club Discord so that is behind a kind of the coin Bureau Club is where guy and the rest of the research team will review specific to tokens and projects anyone who is a member of the club can vote on which altcoins they would like like to review and then our team will do a deep dive and look into those for you and also we have kind of an open Q&A where you can interact with myself and the team we also have all of our portfolios open as well including our watch list so you can see what kind of projects we're looking out for yeah and also which kind of ones are we're flagging is people we might have met conversations we might have heard um and it's pretty insightful you get a glimpse into our brains sometimes the guys will share stuff in the club before they even share us at our desks so it's Alpha off the press yeah I'll tell you uh I'm doing this this video which is on my top uh tools that I use and I mean the ones that I can legally use like uh what Ben's website you know which I steal from constantly but I was doing but I'm I've been you guys gave me access to coin Bureau club and I was doing this this review and I was like I wonder how they how they did the last set of of videos that you guys did if Benny just throw this up and everybody can can they can they can troubleshoot me they can they can figure this out take a look at all these projects right now dieso metis robit relo claros and metal blockchain never heard of them in my life right I'm sure people right now are like what the heck is that they were done in October 2023 also in November and then the latest one was yeah November 2023 just take a look at the price appreciation from what they reviewed to today and you'll be pleasantly surprised so I'll be doing a a video at some point when I get enough time to do it so you guys are doing great work thanks awesome thank you I'll pass that on to the rest of the the research team as well because they are Relentless with scrolling through kind of topics and deep diving into these tokens and it's great the feedback that we've had so far yeah it looks really great and I mean thanks for sharing all the uh all the different views you guys had on all these different alt coins I think the audience is um excited to hear all that I will say all right let's get to some questions because we we're actually bit early today we've gotten through a lot of these questions a lot quicker um I actually saw a really interesting question um Satoshi is finally released from solitary confinement after years how do they react what has become of their creation how does the market react any of you either you want to take that Jess go ahead you oh this is a good question well so first of all I think Satoshi he she whoever I think think they would be a little bit pissed at the institutions getting involved yeah so I think they would kind of come up and maybe work their magic to democratize maybe they would have a sitdown meeting of one-on-one with Michael sailor and be like dude you have got almost 1% of circula and supply of BTC at this point with micro strategy let's see if we can negotiate a way for you to democratize that a little bit and give give it out to the people share it and become more of a Bitcoin Jesus I think that would be satoshi's Mission if Satoshi was to come back I think yeah great oh Jess you're gonna get us some hate for that one but it's true because I'm sure if he came back he would probably say did anybody read this these nine pages I put out it's very simple it's very short and I'm pretty sure I put in there peer-to-peer transactions what does that not make sense what are you guys talking about and of course or maybe that that's how I see it you know but maybe he comes back and like oh you guys did some pretty good stuff but it looks like there's a why are these all these ETFs gobbling it up and the institutions which we're kind of fighting against and here we are but uh well you know numbers go up I guess I don't know if he would say that or if he'd be like what Jessica just said I'm on the train that he would probably be not too happy and go ahead go ahead no go I'll I was GNA you can finish your thought process and then I'll go to another question I was just going to say he's probably also one ing if he came to Dubai why on Earth there is orange Lamborghinis with Bitcoin logos painted all over them that definitely was not in the in the white paper anywhere when Lambo I think was was in a hashtag somewhere I was thought it was funny how like the people that are you know quote unquote in it for the tech have been the people pumping the ETF stuff more than anyone else like you know like and I I think Satoshi when if you looked at the whole ETF stuff it's like wait that's not why Bitcoin was created not so that the institutions could hold your keys it's kind of the opposite um so I think it kind of does go it goes to show that people like to say they're in it for the tech but most of them are in it for the price to go up and I think that's pretty Apparent at this point um if it wasn't already apparent before so um yeah I think you're right Rob I mean I think the ETF stuff would maybe have him uh raising an eyebrow to some degree um let's keep going um or maybe he loves it I don't know I don't know I mean I guess we'll never know when he's released from solitary confinement he can tell us I guess um I know let's see I'm trying to find some other good questions here um I just wonder I just wonder if he's already out there and he's already like GH I don't want to deal with this anymore this is this is a great project maybe it's Elon Musk and he's like I got I got a I got a cyber truck to make I don't even have time for this I don't know if you guys saw this but um I guess both yesterday uh or today Japan and the UK just had two consecutive quarters of negative GDP um and so by the technical definition that is a recession in those countries at the same time uh the you know the stock markets and but in in I mean in Japan it's nearing the prior highs from like 20 years ago um the stock market in in Germany is is at all-time highs and I don't I don't know exactly where the where the one in the UK is but what do you guys think I mean there have been there have been periods in the past where you know some countries had have you have you ever heard the saying like when the when the US catches a cold the rest of the world catches like the flu or something right um there there was an example previously where where this sort of stuff happened and then the US sort of skirted a recession I think that was back in like 2015 2016 where some other countries were unable to avoid it so I guess the question here is do you think that those are a precursor to what could theoretically happen in the US economy you know there was there was two things I know that either it's either guy or Jessica you guys you did a whole piece on bail-ins and bailouts for Central Bankers globally and it was interesting because when you take a look at it you're like oh they're going to take money from us and they're going to bail in themselves they're going to put on they're going to turn the printer on a quantitative easing there was a there was a piece I covered a couple of days ago where it was it was a goofy price prediction title but it had some Merit and because I don't like using price predictions because it screws everything up and people like they get to overzealous but it was one of the guys who actually called the last cycle he said no Bitcoin will be between 15 100,000 and this this is the data and and he's uh been been right so far not and he's you know he's been on some reasonable councils now he's saying 200,000 to 600,000 the reason is because of the massive amount of bailouts and bail-ins and quantitative easing because there's so much debt around in the world the only way to service the interest rate on that debt is to fire up the printers and for that to happen then of course everything inflates he goes so as time goes on like for these things that are happening he pretty much was talking about this is going to be the norm going to bail things out they going to be a lot of uh funds out there be massive debt quantitative easing and then of course the price of Bitcoin everything goes up and that's I think is the most scary thing that that we could have I don't know if it's gonna happen but it kind of is like it's just weird because I just talked about this two days ago it's kind of interesting because I mean you have to think about like yeah they'll turn the money printer on at some point um I think they're just trying to hold off as long as they can So to avoid another wave of inflation which would be awful I don't think anyone wants that um actually someone just asked what do you what do you guys think of the latest CPI data any thoughts on it I mean I think it was a little stickier than what a lot of people were hoping for I think still technically it came down from the month before but it was higher than what people were expecting and it did have a slight impact on BTC price when the data initially came out so we actually I picked Arthur Hayes's brains on this the interview will be coming live on Saturday and he did give his outlook on the US economy and his impressions of when we are going to see possibly a retracement or even in some words kind of a market crash or recession like um environment from the US and also from Japan and then how that will impact crypto so I won't give too much away but um that's coming soon I look forward to that yeah I mean I it's certainly an interesting um thing I mean I think that the FED is you know I mean I look I I think that everyone wants rate Cuts you know I think the market is is hungry for rate cuts and the CPI data has just basically delayed those rate cuts um more than likely so yeah I mean I you know the longer they go the more likely they are to you know to have a negative impact um but we'll see if they can if they can cut before before something like that happen um as long as we don't have a repeat of vulker or Burns back in the 70s and you know inflation quadruples then I think we'll be okay I don't know about a soft Landing but we'll see um did you hey Ben I I didn't watch it the whole way through but did you was your last Bitcoin dominance video an hour and a half uh I don't know time flies when you're having fun I don't I don't really know oh man dominance bearish or bullish this is this is your I answer this you guys the guess you guys are the guest they already know my they already know my answer I don't even know how seriously how are I don't even know what it is I don't know what it is Ben see because I know we're coming on the stream with you so I'm like Ben's got this one he's got it covered I mean like I I I I think Bitcoin dominance is bullish surprise surprise um I my guess is that I mean actually the last couple of days you know altcoins have have been keeping Pace with Bitcoin like dominance has kind of stalled out here at 54% but I I think it will break above 54 um I you know I think after after it can clear that 54 Milestone and get some weekly closes I think the highest weekly close for Bitcoin dominance at least this cycle was about 54 35% or so is that right yeah 54. 35% so I think it needs to clear that um and then it should get it should get another push higher yeah I mean I think it's probably going to go you know first to 56% and then theoretically all the way up to the elusive 60% level which is where I think it could um actually top out at around 60% dominance um that's my view and that's kind of why I mean you know I put out a tweet about this earlier or yesterday I was like everyone thinks I I you know hate altcoins because I because of my Bitcoin dominance um views but it's just like you know like I mean for me in Prior Cycles I would already be you know full DJ right into all these right you know I think is I think as like Cycles go on like the longer you're here the more you just sort of focus on the things that that stand the test of time right and like we were talking about it earlier right like look at you know EOS right I mean a few years ago it was all the hype and now it's down almost 99 it's down 99.4% against Bitcoin right you could have lost a lot of money if you converted a lot of your Bitcoin to EOS back then I mean and by a lot I mean 99.4% of your asso value so yeah I mean like I I think that Bitcoin can can lift the altcoin market for sure um it's just that I I think Bitcoin will outperform the collective altcoin Market but hey there's always some out there's always even when dominance goes up there's always some altcoins that outperformed and I I mean I think you guys probably talked about some of them earlier that have been outperforming Bitcoin for the last few months but that's always the case right there's always some that do and and usually the ones that do are the newer coins right the ones that don't have as much baggage from the prior cycle right the because they don't have all like the bag holders all the way down so they there's more like you know there's not as much um overhead for them to for them to go up I think the problem with some of the other coins is that while some of them can certainly reach new alltime highs eventually um you know you just have a ton of people that that might sell at various resistance levels because they bought in on the way down um sort of my view yeah and then you know like just to piggy back off that like people talk about well you know this this project has you know real utility and it's doing great and it's going to take over and then like the example me and Jess just both gave was helium if you take a look back to what helium's price was in 2021 when it did nothing nothing nothing it was over 50 bucks and now it just hit 10 somewhere around there and it actually has a working product and it's the same thing like I was give an example of like alivium it's a web 3 game nothing back in 2021 over a thousand dollars and now here we at 100 so like I think that a lot of this it's honestly just speculation and hype and you really have to take a look at what is going to be around here for the Long Haul as best you yeah um there are some people that are asking about I've seen it a few times let me just grab one of the most recent ones that have asked this question um if I can find it um basically the question is is do you think we could have a left translated cycle top I I think what they're saying someone else asked it in a way that it doesn't require us to you know like the um so like this one like the uh is it showing um I don't know it's not showing up basically the idea is you know it's rallying a lot at normally this time of the you know like normally at this there there it is right like do you think that we could have an earlier top or do you think the the traditional fouryear cycle will hold um where you get a peak late 2025 right so we had like a peak late 2021 we had a peak late 2017 we had a peak late 2013 so then you know will there be another Peak late 2025 or or will it will a a top potentially come early what do you guys think think I would say it is a little bit kind of unnerving first of all with crypto you have to expect the unexpected there is no kind of copy and paste with each four-year cycle there's no cookie cutter approach also this year is different because we have seen the inflows from the institutions that has started to come in and that has changed the market Dynamic a little bit so typically you wouldn't see price movements in the buildup to the Haring like what we've seen in these few months so this is something which is slightly giving a different outlook for for the haling and in the buildup for that I wouldn't be surprised if we do see a retracement at some point in the next kind of six to 12 months slightly or a correction based on what we've seen um but I would say taking profits and keeping an eye and not expecting a certain date in mind just based on the market conditions that we have seen is pretty important for this ball cycle so you're not left holding your bags in 2020 and you've kind of missed the boat of taken some decent profits yeah I mean I I think that I mean we are definitely ahead of like where we were in Prior Cycles at the same time um you know two of the prior Cycles were sort of double Peak Cycles right like 2021 was a double Peak cycle but they the Peaks were the same 2013 was a double Peak cycle but the second Peak was higher than the first Peak so I almost wonder if if something like that could happen again where you get sort of your first Peak um you know around the the the having and all that stuff and you cool off for a little bit and then you get another Peak I don't know out in 2025 but I I really don't know I mean it's the market is when the Market's like this it's really dangerous to try to predict you know exactly where it's going to top out because Bitcoin often shows that it you know these these rallies can last longer than most people think they can and then you know just when we think it can never go down again it does yeah yeah I think uh you know it's what's funny is like I remember back in 2021 around April March or April you put out a video it was a P Cycle top video and he said hey look here's a P Cycle top 350 day moving average 350 day moving average times two and it crosses over I think it's a 111 day moving average and he said usually when this happens we top out I think the price was like 56 58,000 around there sometime something around there and then we went up to 63 and then we took a dip and then we came back up to 67 that was it I think if people would have just said all right well this is a pretty good number 58,000 didn't hit the top which you did a lot better than you know wait until 205,000 when it when it crash again so but just to reiterate I think I think that because we're we're ahead of schedule we're going to see a pretty massive Bull Run and very bullish but uh I can't tell the time frames so just take profits along the way if you're so inclined or Diamond hands it it's up to you not a financial advisor it's up to you guys and who remembers 2017 as well where everyone was like keeping their fingers crossed that Bitcoin would go to $10,000 of Bitcoin and then it skyrocketed P to 17 everyone thought 20 was a possibility and then and then last it was all gone had to take profits along the way yeah wasn't it uh who was it was it there a Futures ETF was approved by the CBOE and then of course everybody's like this is fantastic this is goingon to be the biggest thing of all time and then what happened that was the beginning of the end for that cycle yeah good times good times the at Old Times guys yeah 2017 was crazy because I remember I remember the 10K Target and everyone a lot of people thought that was the top and then it doubled from there yeah yeah in such a short time frame as well yeah yeah ex huh oh yeah in 2017 was exponential games that was wild you know who was the best Trader of that cycle Charlie Lee yeah he sold at the top I I gotta him and Nancy Pelosi I need to take their trading class because whatever they're doing they're doing right yeah have you guys ta with Nancy Pelosi have you guys heard this example before no it's not my example it's it's Warren Buffett's example it's not mine um um basically I know everyone when you're when you're in you know a parabolic rally right like everyone's at a party and when the clock strikes midnight this is Warren Buffett's example when the clock strikes Midnight at the party everyone who's still at the party will turn into a pumpkin or a mouse I can't remember what it I think it was like maybe about let's just say a pumpkin right at midnight everyone's going to turn into a pumpkin who's still at the party so it's simple right you just have to leave the party before you turn into a pumpkin right before it's midnight right is that's the idea right you just you leave the party before it's midnight and you you don't turn into a pumpkin and so everyone is obviously planning on leaving the party before midnight the problem is there's no clock on the wall so you don't we don't actually know what time it is right like you know maybe you think it's like you know 100 PM but it's actually 11 p.m. right and so you know you you end up partying too long and then you end up getting turned into a pumpkin so that's why you know you really should echo or I would I would Echo what Rob said and just I mean like it's nothing wrong with taking profits along the way um and and also recognizing that hey the market can go up far higher than a lot of people will predict um and then it can drop a lot more than people will often predict but yeah I mean pretty interesting times right now for sure I mean Bitcoin is actually up I mean it's it almost just hit 53k we did it congratulations thanks everybody um yes the one last question I've seen it come up a couple of times people are talking about like do you have like so normally what people do is after Bitcoin hits highs they will then convert Bitcoin into altcoins and so some people are saying well you know because a lot of the money is going into spot ETFs and holding Bitcoin there could that potentially break the trend of of sort of a shift from Bitcoin into the altcoin market like you know if you're I guess if you're buying a spot ETF for Bitcoin you can't just cash that out and go buy a spot ETF for you know a random altcoin right you'd actually have to go to a you know to an exchange and buy it any takers Rob do you want to start with this one or do you want me to I'll jump on in so again I think it goes back I do think this year could be different so we have already seen altcoins that have hit new alltime highs we started to see that around October we saw huge price Gaines with the likes of salana we had alltime highs with the likes of injective in December time um and now moving into this cycle where Bitcoin is starting to lead the pack on price gains we are starting to see a little bit more of a Level Playing Field but I think it will depend on your rotation appetite if you look at your individual kind of portfolio and how much you are looking to to reallocate I personally have around 60% in Bitcoin and then the rest in ethereum and other alternative coins and for me that's good I'm not going to be moving any of my Bitcoin at any other point in the cycle into alternative coins I don't want to miss the boat with Bitcoin and end up flirting between the two and actually missing some pretty significant percentage gains along the way yeah I mean 60% is a I mean that's a good I think that's a decent amount um I'm I'm higher just because I'm more you know I just because of the the the Bitcoin dominance views but I I think that um even if even if you guys are like super you know for the audience like you know like speculating the altcoin market it's still generally not a bad idea to have some know some Bitcoin because it will like that's the one that sticks around from one cycle to another um altcoins sort of come and go so I think I think it's just good practice to have you know some form of a Bitcoin position rather than just nothing in Bitcoin and everything and sort of more speculative stuff but maybe that's just me um Rob do you want to take that that question up too no just I mean same thing real just real quick is that uh you know rotating at all coins is of course riskier but the rewards are higher so just uh be aware of that situation and then of course uh when we talk about taking profits like I know that this is probably not the ideal time because of course we're going to go up but when I talk about taking profits just at some point we all know how to buy we all know how to DCA we're all fantastic experts at that but I think we all suck at uh taking profits I could be wrong but I'm not the greatest so as time goes on take a little profits along the way so you know you know like oh that's what it feels like and and maybe it does go do a 20x at least I have something in the in the bank But as time goes on I think it'll it'll help out especially as we get into the Mania that is the blowoff top Bull Run and that's that's coming and it's it could be 12 months it could be 18 months but it's coming and you have to be prepared for that well it's the top of the hour so why don't we wrap it up there guys if you're not subscribed to Jessica or Rob make sure you do so links to their YouTube channels are in the description below and next week I guess we will be on Rob's channel right Rob all right yep sounds good so we'll see you guys next week on Rob's Channel thanks everybody bye guys",Youtube video,2024-02-15 00:00:00,"Here is an enhanced and more comprehensive summary:The discussion covers the recent launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs, the potential impact on institutional adoption, and the upcoming Ethereum ETF. Key points:- The Bitcoin spot ETF launch has seen strong demand, with over $42 billion in inflows in the first 20 days. This has restored confidence among institutional investors, though some are still waiting to assess the risks.- The upcoming Bitcoin halving event in around 60 days is expected to drive increased retail interest and price appreciation, though the full impact may not be seen until 12-18 months after the halving.- The hype around AI stocks in traditional markets could spill over into the crypto space, particularly projects with an AI narrative, though there are concerns about overhyped and underperforming projects.- The prospects for an Ethereum ETF approval are seen as positive given the precedent set by the Bitcoin ETF, though it may not generate as much hype as the Bitcoin ETF did. There is still uncertainty around Ethereum's regulatory status as a security, which could potentially slow down the approval process.- The panelists discuss the potential for a left-translated Bitcoin cycle top, where the market peaks earlier than expected. They note that while some altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin recently, the longer-term trend has historically been for Bitcoin dominance to increase as the market matures, with many altcoins struggling to maintain their value over time.- The discussion also touches on the potential impact of global macroeconomic factors, such as central bank bailouts and quantitative easing, which could drive further price appreciation in Bitcoin and other crypto assets as investors seek inflation hedges.- The panelists emphasize the importance of taking profits along the way, rather than trying to time the market perfectly. They caution against the pumpkin party analogy, where investors stay in the market too long and end up losing their gains.- The group also discusses the potential impact of institutional investment in Bitcoin spot ETFs on the altcoin market. While some believe this could disrupt the traditional cycle of rotating from Bitcoin to altcoins, others argue that a diversified portfolio with a significant Bitcoin allocation is still a prudent strategy.Overall, the summary maintains a bullish sentiment, highlighting the strong institutional and retail demand for crypto assets, particularly Bitcoin, and the potential for further price appreciation around the halving event, AI-related narratives, and broader macroeconomic trends. The panelists also emphasize the importance of risk management and taking profits throughout the market cycle.",501,"[-0.009017944, 0.0036525726, -0.043395996, -0.0023097992, 0.0066108704,

 everybody Welcome to the no shill Zone we are back how you doing Ben pretty good how about you g good man very good so so let's jump right back into it right so we got a a Bitcoin that is basically 50k in fact it looks like we hit it to the penny on my uh bitstamp chart we can take a look at obviously what it's doing on the coinbase one as well here let's bring that up but I I guess the question is are do you expect us to see a breakout here or is this going to be a stall out and reversal you know my my views on the market have essentially been that the liquidity from all the altcoins essentially it has to flow back to bitcoin well I guess nothing has to happen right but the idea is that Bitcoin will continue to sort of chop the altcoin market up until it has finally broken the altcoin market down and look the altcoin market has held up against Bitcoin longer this cycle than it did last cycle um there's no doubt about it um but yeah I mean you have the spot ETF flows right going into Bitcoin you also just have the regular people who sort of the regular DCA that that get into it but you know when you look at at days like today and you see Bitcoin pushing 50k and you go look at all Bitcoin pairs look at them right they're all just they're mostly just bleeding back to bitcoin and that I think is ultimately what what needs to happen is I think Bitcoin will continue this I mean I don't know if it's going to get rejected off 50k or not on the first try but my guess is that it will continue to try until we finally see you know eth Bitcoin break down until we finally see all Bitcoin pairs break down do you have do you have any idea like what would you say is the reasoning behind the altcoins holding up better is it is it the risk on in atmosphere is it the liquidity that's you know really we've seen M2 start to uptick again uh we've seen the the debt the credit card debt which is basically people consuming and more liquidity in the system is it all kind of tied together yeah I guess so I mean I I think there is a lot more liquidity this cycle uh than there was last cycle but in in other ways you could view the market it really isn't that different in in some regards and and here's a great example one that that kind of implies that it actually isn't that different like you know the eth Bitcoin chart the monthly candles if you were to actually just look at at how long it has taken eth Bitcoin let's say let's say take it from from this first high right here until it finally broke down in June of 2019 or really I guess it was July of 2019 it was about 25 months right we're currently on around 26 months right so it's really in that view it's not that different different right but it can certainly feel that way I I think one of the reasons it feels that way is because in this cycle over here the second Peak for eth Bitcoin was basically right when Bitcoin was putting in its all-time high but the second Peak for eth Bitcoin in this past cycle it was you know well into the bare market right and you're talking about it was near the end it was near the merge the end of 2022 so that could be one reason why the perception of it of it is is different this time but I do think that big coin will continue to sort of make these aggressive moves until we see that that Bitcoin dominance break out right we've been following this forever um and it's back near the range highs I mean again last cycle we saw Bitcoin go through this exact same type of rally until the until the Bitcoin dominance Street trades to the 0.5 FIB retracement which is all the way up at 56% and you know I know I know some people look at the Bitcoin chart and they would like a larger correction um we we've only had you know we've had four 20% Corrections at this point basically since 2023 started um and every single one of them has been about 20% right very similar types of moves last cycle you know QT late business cycle the problem is you know once the once the 30% correction came during that during that move it actually meant that there was a longer you know I I I think the idea is right there's a lot of people that want to quote unquote buy the dip they only get 20 they only get these shallow dips right they only get 20% dips so by the time you maybe get a 30% dip and people go in to buy it it might you know it might do some type of 2019 action where it then goes into a downtrend for you know half a year or something before continuing the overall move what what do you think Gareth I mean what is 50k is is it gonna be a formidable Milestone or can Bitcoin get through it yeah so I think a lot has to do for me is is just watching the the liquidity in the system and the stock market right so so you know it's there the fact that the S&P is just hitting new new highs continually right so so today there's no volume in the market we're in a hangover Day from the Super Bowl uh volume again in the S&P is is probably on Pace to be the lightest in the last year um so when you kind of combine that and you look at just the grind up in the market the the insanity which is like an Nvidia chart that just continues to to Rally higher um it's a risk on environment I mean it just is and so that's going to money flow is eventually going to say okay well what else is risk on what should be running during this period and that's Bitcoin and really alt to some extent I do think it's kind of interesting that you have a risk on environment should which should be really positive for alt but we're not seeing necessarily new highs versus Bitcoin has just made a new high I think the last high on the spot news was 49,000 and here we're hitting 50,000 so so you do see a little bit more relative strength in in something like Bitcoin which is probably ETF you know getting more money flow in there but um but yeah it's an incredible Market en environment here where liquidity is is just flowing I mean risk people willing to take risk um even in spite of interest rates still being relatively good I mean you could still find 5% on a you know a CD right now for a short-term CD which historically is not too bad especially over the last 20 years um but people are still choosing to be in the stock market because that's where these insane gains are right well I mean it's as far as it goes with altcoins I mean look as long as Bitcoin goes up the altcoin market can you know can can get pulled up higher right I mean Bitcoin sort of lifts those up my you know sort of the argument that that I've made before is tracking Bitcoin and and Bitcoin dominance is like yeah like altcoins can go up for sure if Bitcoin goes up the only reason altcoins are going to go up well collectively there's always a few that you could you know find some exceptions but collectively they would go up only after Bitcoin does right so you you know if you want to have the strongest horse it would make sense to have you know keep a crypto portfolio I think heavier Bitcoin than heavier altcoins and until we get back to looser monetary policy G you know a few weeks ago I think when 2024 started um you mentioned that the S&P would likely rally uh to 5,000 here at the early part of the year but now that we are at 5,000 what like what comes next I mean you know we've already we've hit that round number do you think it can just extend these gains um as as I mean crypto is not really crypto hasn't slowed down yet no yeah what what are your thoughts on the so this is really really interesting is that is that so you look at this chart and and I mean the vertical nature of the S&P is incredible just I mean to just put this in perspective you know you look at the last time so we've had 14 weeks out of 15 have been green on the S&P 500 I think there's been two other times in history where that's happened it was 1957 and I think 1927 so it shows you how rare it is to have such a kind of continual grind up in the market um with the S&P higher today I think one of the keys that I I was shocked by over the weekend is a stat that says that with the S&P at new all-time highs 39% of the S&P stocks are below their 50 moving average so think about what that's saying that's saying that essentially you you've just under half of the S&P stocks are underneath their 50 moving average we're not talking the 20 moving average we're talking the 50 which is even harder to be below um and more bearish for those stocks and and interestingly enough at the start of the Year 91% of stocks in the S&P were above their 50 so even though the S&P is going higher almost daily and weekly there's been this underlying degradation in what is essentially the underlying fundamentals of it right and so you know in layman's terms it's basically telling us that the rally is being led by less and less names within the S&P and the and it really is it should be a warning sign so yes could we go a little bit higher but at some point if that Trend continues it's a trend that is unsustainable well again I mean it's the same thing we saw in crypto right like total market cap of crypto is going up because bitcoin's going up right it's not it's not because the altcoins have you know gone back to where they were a few weeks ago it's because Bitcoin is now pushing new new yearly highs and it is putting a new year this is the um this is the chart you were just talking about G this is the uh the S&P 500 overlaid with the number of stocks I guess with the percentage of stocks in it that are above their 50-day SMA and so yeah I mean you're right like the the S&P continues to climb higher um thanks to you know a few of the larger market cap names it's actually a I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of hedge funds struggle to outperform the S&P is because there are a lot of examples in history where only a few stocks are responsible for a large number you know a large percentage of the gains and it's hard to it can be hard to sort of pick those stocks out whereas the S&P collectively like the index it'll have it in there and so you sort of allowing those few stocks to lift it higher but you're right I mean yeah you can look at it the percentage of stocks above their 50-day SMA and the stock market has basically been trending down and I think I think if you look historically look at how rare that is for that to happen I mean you know it's it's pretty I I me looking at other scenarios where you've seen that Divergence essentially the crocodile uh you know Jaws starting to kind of open here with that Divergence and eventually we know what the outcome is if you look historically it snaps back shut with either you know the lower Bunch jumping up but then the the S&P usually coming back down yeah but again I mean I I think it's important to remember that those Trends can take months to out if not longer I mean that's the whole thing with the business cycle right like the business cycle can take years to play out you know I think it's easy for us to look at a chart and look at like the 70s and see all the you know all the rate hiking cycles and rate cutting cycles and see the S&P but you know each of those Cycles took years to play out and I mean you have to imagine a lot of emotion was tied into into every single one of those moves back then yeah 100% I I couldn't agree more and so yeah it is a remarkable market right now I think I think you know you you look at risk assets and then and then you have gold right on the other side of the coin which is you know basically just um staying stationary at this point right and so let me bring up my gold chart here and we can look at talk a little bit about that gold today is lower and we're actually seeing a little bit of a breakdown below this short-term trend line right here which again I don't think there's a lot of downside on gold here I think gold again has shown that it's resilient and staying near these all-time highs even in spite of a risk on atmosphere and for everyone out there watching remember that when you get the markets hitting new all-time highs usually gold is selling off because no one wants to be in Gold why would you be in Gold when you could be in stocks but the mere fact that gold has held up this well in this bull market for the last year year and a half is is a is a testament to to people still accumulating including central banks but but short term you are seeing a little breakdown here um the other thing to just point out I wanted to just show you guys is take a look at the vix today so you have a stock market that's floating up but you're actually seeing the vix pop today a little little bit and then there's been this kind of General trend on the vix that has been making higher low a higher highs and high higher lows as well and historically I think this might have been the last time we kind of saw that over here you do tend to get Pops in that period um from that from that movement so so just something to keep in mind you know again I think you you say it perfectly when you have to say that there's the timing is the hardest thing right you you can see that the storm clouds are are showing but you don't know is it next week next month or next year basically right yeah I mean as far as the S&P goes I'm pretty I'm pretty much a fairly boring investor I just sort of DCA into some low expense ratio index funds when you know like on on pullbacks and when like Risk levels are low like back in in October when you know Yellen issued shorter duration than the market was expecting we had you know we basically had the the market essentially recognizing that the FED had hit the terminal rate right of 5 and a half% and you had favorable seasonality in Q4 of the pre-election year that was a you know that was time for me to say all right well we probably will see stocks rally for a while and I I mean I I think it's hard to know exactly when it's going to stop a lot of times after fed pauses the stock market can rally 20 25% and it's not like that's actually the median I think return on stocks after a Fed after a Fed Paul so uh and and by the way as far as gold goes um we're we're still I you know if you look at at at least last cycle and and prior cycle a lot of times the time when gold really takes off is after QE returns right and I I think it's because like why QE returns right like if QE is returning because the economy is weak then people are going to go risk off and pile into into riskof assets yeah and I mean you can see 2019 essentially is what happened right like QE you rates started to be cut and that's where gold really started to go higher yeah yeah and then and then secondarily yeah we saw we basically saw that lasting into covid right you know the move that ended with the pop that kind of you know in late 2020 gold topped out but that was when the Fed was going gang busters in terms of you know printing money and flooding the system with liquidity essentially quantitative easing so no that's a great Point what are your thoughts on like I mean you know obviously looking at Bitcoin itself but but like ethereum like how how is your Viewpoint you like there's been a lot of talk that with a potential spot ETF later this year maybe the ethereum is the place to be for the next big bull run for ethereum um you know do you have any viewpoints on that well yeah I mean look my view on on eth is that um it can go higher so long as Bitcoin does but I I think that Bitcoin will continue to sort of rule the roots I I think Bitcoin is King and I don't think ethereum is going to take it away if you remember at the spot ETF launch right you know following the spot ETF launch of of of Bitcoin a lot of money flowed into eth right I mean if we remember you know I mean look at this eth Bitcoin rally right it rallied up 17 % in a single week and it's effectively given back all of those gains at this point it has and yes I I agree like the spot ETF for ethereum is likely long-term bullish for e but you have the having before you know between now and then so if if the market really does continue to remain narrative driven which I mean you could argue that it will be then I I you know while it's possible that that eth gets a relative move against Bitcoin for sure you know sometime when that launches or going into the launch I still have to think well we have the having between now and then and I I think people are going to be more focused on that and I mean you can see that it I mean it's bleeding back down to the range lows and by the way you know last cycle eth Bitcoin finally broke support right it finally broke support right as the First Rate cut arrived and so I I I think that yes it's possible that eth b the eth Bitcoin ratio bounces around in this level it's not like it has to immediately fall but I still think the ultimate outcome is for it to break down around the time of the First Rate cut who knows when that's going to be as far as ethusd um you know it's kind of eerily similar to to again the last cycle almost an order of magnitude higher in fact right like if you look at at where ethusd bottomed out over here it was around you know 8590 right here is about $800 $900 um you know this rally over here essentially lasted at least on on weekly closes up to around 300 with a wick to you know 350 or so and I mean look ethereum is already at 2500 it already made a move to 2700 if Bitcoin stays risk on for you know a few more weeks or a few more months of course it can lift ethereum higher it's just you know does does ethereum go up in a durable fashion relative to bitcoin or not and my guess is that it doesn't my guess is that it underperforms Bitcoin like my guess is that we look back on this period a year from now while there will have been some bounces I'm still guessing it eventually breaks durably below 049 and and likely spends a year or so um below 049 before likely breaking back up to the upside I don't know sometime in in you know 2025 or or something what what's your view on eth I mean are you are you in the camp that it's going to outperform bitcoin or or do you still think Bitcoin or or what's your views on on ethusd yeah so so again you know I think one of the things for me at least is I I've been staying much more shorter term in terms of levels um so so so for instance you see the parallel lines and there something about markets where where they stay Within These parallels is just absolutely remarkable but we could see here how you know you had this High here and it kind of bubbled against it finally breaking and then that became support we broke up we came back down it became support again and now E's moved up and then you have the high line which is parallel to this one as well and we've now just crept above that so as long as we stay above this line the probabilities favor us at least moving up to like 2775 which would be the upper trend line which is again another parallel uh line so so I would say that again as long as we stay above 2500 you favor 2775 of being hit whether or not it gets through that I think that's as we get closer to a potential spot ETF that would be the trigger if it really is going to get a bid and break through there it's got to be something different right something that makes it makes it have that power to bust through that upper trend line up here but but yeah it's been an amazing amazing mover just in the recent days kind of following along with Bitcoin um you know just looking at a couple of these others I can take a look at cardano for people out there I thought this was interesting you had this wedge pattern you can see again we broke above it right here and then it's kind of been up but but again I think it's important to draw the the the comparison here that you know you have Bitcoin making new highs in the short term right we we hit 49 now we're hitting 50 a month later or so um you had you have ethereum which is still underneath and then you have uh these secondary tier cryptos these altcoins that are still really struggling I mean they've broken out a lot of them but some of them haven't I mean I was looking at inj here which to be honest this is this is actually underneath a significant resistance line right here right from this point here to this low we broke below and it still hasn't really gotten much of a bid to recapture that um couple others that are like that as well let me just see here what was the another one um I guess you could look at uh let's take let's take a look at Salas salana is an interesting one so salana I have this this really long-term trend line going back to October of 2023 and notice how again it just hammered on the line but didn't break down and it just kind of led into that epic blowoff top right here it then came back and hit it a few times and then broke down and now look the this was support for all this period it now becomes resistance so resistance here pulls back and then right back to that level here at resistance and we'll see what it does here but but it's it's interesting to see a lot of these things except for Bitcoin that are struggling underneath resistance points not to say they can't break out like if if risk on stays they sure certainly can but but Bitcoin right now certainly is the leader here well I think a lot of times like when people are in crypto for more than just one cycle like the first cycle everyone loves altcoins second cycle you get really cautious around them like you know that they can pump but you also know that they can give back all those gains you know by your third cycle or so a lot of people just kind of stick with Bitcoin and maybe some some e um because it's just that the altcoins I mean look they can give lifechanging gains I mean I I've definitely made a lot of money on altcoins in the past but if you're looking for more of like a a slow and and sort of steady thing you want to protect the satos valuation of your portfolio you know having a large percentage of of your portfolio in Bitcoin over say altcoins I I think is is sort of a long-term winning strategy now if you can if you can do what you do right with where you take the sort of these shorter term trades um then you can sort of flip back and forth um but I I still think that yeah like Bitcoin and by the way I mean like look at like Ada Bitcoin is is now back down to 1100 1100 stats and it's kind of like the same thing as like the whole eth Bitcoin stuff right like I mean like this is a very similar move where you kind of you put in a low and then you put in a lower low right it's it's all the same stuff you then pop back up and then you you know you put in a higher low and then you sort of you get your final local blowoff top and I mean it really looks like a really similar type of pattern there right where it like it gets these moves adaa Bitcoin topped out last cycle April 2019 you know about three four months before fed pivoted um could it be the same thing I I I think it it is likely and so if that happens what I you know what I would be looking at is look to see if these are breaking down you know when it goes talking about ethereum earlier I think as long as it's above 0.49 then the bias is for it to chase after Bitcoin right like if as long as you're looking at it and it's a 0.5 handle then fine like it's it can chase after Bitcoin but if it goes below 0.49 I I think that really would represent a a shift like a a major Dynamic a major Market shift in E and the reason is because I mean like it it I mean look I it that's just what happened like that's just what happens um in in at least prior Cycles right and I don't it's hard to know exactly like the um sort of the mechanics behind it um we argue about like liquidity and and all that other stuff but often times when you know when you see at least in the last couple of Cycles when we've seen eth Bitcoin break down there and when we saw it break down here that was where the purple line that was where ethusd finally took a hit right that was after eth Bitcoin broke down so again I think things are okay so long as eth Bitcoin stays above 0.49 below 049 I think you have to wonder like has has has maybe too much liquidity been sucked out and then that represents sort of a turning point in the market but yeah in the short term I I definitely agree um with your views on on on those alss yeah so let's turn our attention to we have economic data right so so every investor should be aware that we got CPI tomorrow uh later this week PPI um you know we know the fed the FED is kind of been choreographing second half rate cut three maybe this year the market says no we think March right now and we think five or six you know so so the question I guess is is I mean is there a chance that we start to see an uptick in some of in the CPI data I mean what's what's pushing the FED is the Fed just scared of the 1970s of a repeat and that's why they're trying to take this cautionary stance I mean who can blame them right I mean you know if you look if you look at at headline inflation in the 70s the first Peak which I know it looks smaller than the current Peak but the way they calculated it back then was actually a lot different than it is now um but if you were to look at this first Peak we came down to around 3% and then it just re accelerated right and then we came down to to 5% and then it re accelerated so I do think we have to learn our lesson from the prior Cycles where you know where the S&P you know went on to put in new Highs but if you have inflation re accelerate that just means you're gonna have to hike more right imagine imagine how terrible imagine the feeling If the Fed cut say 50 basis points this year and then had to raise to six and a half percent next year because they didn't you know they didn't go high enough I mean let's just give it over with make sure we're back down to 2% and as Paul said then we can go hopefully into another cycle of economic expansion but yeah I I think that I I think the the main risk to inflation right now is sort of the energy data because some of the base effects are no longer favorable um when comparing to a year ago but some of the other effects I I think are still uh quite strong like in terms of bringing CPI down and one of those is housing I mean if you look at like inflation year-over-year approximation of of contributions per category um you can see that one of the main things that's holding it up is is just simply housing which is still you know covering most of the entire of the entire thing I mean like the green bar is housing and then the orange bar is actually the total headline inflation so housing I think will continue to come down but again I I I think and you also Gareth you know I I also wonder they say they're not politically motivated and I I'd like to believe that but you do have to wonder like are they going to have some Pauls um cutting rates too much the closer they get to the election and I I don't know there's some people that are sort of speculating that you know maybe they won't maybe they won't maybe they will I think they'll likely cut at least a couple times this year as they've said but I don't know I don't know when it's going to come maybe May June what do you think yeah I mean that's kind of where it is right now it seems like it's it's May right now is what's on the table um but but I think again like CPI data coming out and I also think the labor market right I mean the labor market last last note granted I mean you could argue that a lot of that was government jobs um but that's been a consistent thing frankly um but yeah I think I think the labor market if it starts to weaken it gives them that green light to cut I think they'll try to head it off and and go for that um but yeah I mean it's it's uh it's interesting I part of me does think that you'll see a reacceleration in inflation I and again I think some of this is already in the cards meaning like I've been reading articles lately about how in some states a Big Mac meal at McDonald's is now 18 bucks I mean holy cow like insane and then I was reading about how there's been you know push back against Taco Bell because you go eat a Taco Bell it used to be like you know you know three tacos for $3 kind of thing and now it's like I mean that's like 12 bucks or whatever and it's is a big change and and and it's hard to imagine at least for what the the rank and file the the retail consumer out there is feeling is that you know does housing I mean housing is a huge part of our our net worth as a country but also uh there's a large portion of the country that's that's feeling inflation in a whole different way and you just see this Divergence in fact one of the points I wanted to make today is that I was I I was doing a lot of research into the Great Depression and the causes of the Great Depression and it's amazing for those of you out there I'm not going to get into too many details but a lot of the Sim there's so many similarities I mean you have you know crazy changes in in in electricity you know usage where it became more common place in the 20s The Roaring 20s uh you had cars cars started to become a staple now a lot of people in the 20s started to get the Model T and and there things like that um and then you also had this Divergence because of this the Rockefellers and so forth the the those that could invest in the market made massive wealth while there was a huge part of the population that that were not seeing those gains that were being affected by prices going up after World War I um and then here we are where this the same sort of things are are showcasing and so it's not to say andless you know we talked about this earlier it's not to say that we're on the verge of a of a Great Depression but I do think it's history is something that I find fascinating because it gives so much insight into human repetition of of mistakes right things that repe over and over again um and it's something we should all be aware of yeah I mean I think the FED I think they've had a pretty easy job so far especially after their mistake about inflation is transitory you got to hike rates you got to keep them higher for longer as long as unemployment ratees below 4% I mean you know they don't really need I I don't really you know there's not a huge need for them to be aggressive in in cutting I I think where things could become a little bit you know hazy is like what happens if you have inflation kind of reaccelerating like you mentioned and the unemployment rate is also starting to go up right like what ify rate yeah like what if what if the unemployment rate hits 4% but you know core CPI isn't at their target and he said as long as it's moving to their target they'll cut but what if it's moving away from their target you know I wonder I wonder what if it like let's just say it stays here at 3% give or take right if it just stays here and we see a a uptick in in unemployment to like 4% like you're saying what do they do because because obviously if they loosen monetary policy it probably does reinvigorate the potential for the CPI to start to climb again right and then and then and then today's problem just becomes you know next year's problem right you know they just sort of Kick the Can down the road which I mean again they're great at doing but I mean we'll see anyways I guess we should wrap it up we're we're we're basically at 30 minutes and guys if you're not subscribed to Gareth make sure you do so link to all his socials um in the description below and his website uh in the money stocks make sure you guys check that out we'll be here every Monday except when I'm not sick which or except when I'm sick which is actually quite frequent um but yeah that's that's all about having kids buddy we all experience it it's no fun at all but yeah same thing guys make sure to follow Ben here and follow his socials it's awesome stuff and we'll be back hopefully next Monday assuming neither of us are sick you guys",Youtube video,2024-02-12 00:00:00,"The discussion focuses on the current state of the cryptocurrency and stock markets, with a particular emphasis on Bitcoin's recent push towards the $50,000 level and the potential implications for the broader altcoin market. The speakers analyze the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that Ethereum has struggled to maintain its strength relative to Bitcoin, and suggest that Bitcoin will likely continue to outperform altcoins in the near term.The speakers also delve into the potential impact of a Bitcoin spot ETF on the market, as well as the broader economic factors that may influence the direction of the crypto and stock markets. They discuss the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, including the potential for interest rate cuts and the impact on inflation. The speakers express concern about the risk of a reacceleration in inflation, particularly in areas like housing and consumer prices, and the potential challenges this could pose for the Fed's policy decisions.Additionally, the speakers draw parallels between the current economic environment and the Great Depression, highlighting the similarities in terms of technological advancements, wealth disparity, and the potential for mistakes to be repeated. They emphasize the importance of learning from history and being aware of these patterns to avoid similar pitfalls.Overall, the sentiment expressed in the discussion is cautiously bullish on Bitcoin, with the potential for a spot ETF and ongoing liquidity flows into Bitcoin driving its price higher. However, the speakers remain skeptical of the long-term performance of altcoins compared to the market leader, and they express concerns about the broader economic factors that could impact the crypto and stock markets.",310,"[0.051116943, 0.026107788, 0.0038490295, -0.008407593, 0.011543274, -0.027114868, 0.020614624, -0.06149292, 0.0018062592, 0.02583313, -0.019943237, -0.014778137, 0.03656006,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin dubious speculation if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium add into the crypt.of these 20% drops 20 to 22% drops that's what they've all been and once again this drop here was only about a 21 to 22% drop so I mean it goes to show you that the trend is still intact and that sometimes you still will say just kidding when going near the bull market support band so and the reason why that's important is it because it tends to have implications for later on down the road right again I mean it could be weeks it could be months but it tends to have implications later on but in the meantime Bitcoin is pushing close to the the the yearly High the yearly High being just below $49,000 so one of the things to to take a look at here if you look at some of these daily moving averages in the context of the the the bullmark sport band I mean you can see that here we just got to remove it here we got below the 50-day and then once we got back above it we then shot back up and in this case we actually put in a new you know a new local high and then the same thing over here right once we got above that 50-day SMA we went right back up and in this time in that case we swept the high and then here we got above the 50-day we we came back held it as support and then we went up again and so this is why we were focusing a lot on the 50-day and saying look if you get a daily close above the 50-day SMA it sort of favors the idea of going back up um and at the very least going back to these prior highs one of these examples went back to the prior highs and then a couple of the examples actually put in new highs after you know after going below that 50-day SMA so the trend is still intact and one of the things we said previously is that by the time you get a larger correction that I know a lot of people would like you know it certainly could imply that the trend is over and same idea that we saw in you know in 2019 I mean very little Corrections very few Corrections and kept you know leaving people wanting more by the time you actually had a larger correction buying the dip at that point didn't really work out in the short term but it still worked out you know if you if you just had the patience to wait another year so same idea right you're all these have been pretty shallow Corrections um at this point and so by the time you get a larger one I mean for for someone who's who isn't interested in the short term like if you're not interested in short term it doesn't really matter but just something to keep in mind right just something to keep in mind and we also spoke a little bit about um you know we've talked a lot about the the you know the the dominance of of um usdt probably thought I was going to say Bitcoin right but we've talked some about that um and and looking at that Trend there if you look at like the market cap dominance of usdt we' we've sort of noted that if it gets rejected here off its 20we SMA which we had a whole video on right we had a whole video on this that if this gets rejected by its bull market support ban then what you would look for is potentially for it to to tag this trend line eventually and the reason why this trend line is important is because that is actually you know this trend line is ultimately what marked some more you know some some some were Market cycle tops if you want to call them that others were just local tops that lasted for you know a few months maybe a year um and so that sort of the magic number on that if I get the um if I can find it if I get the price label about 4% right if it takes longer it could be 4.3% we're currently at 5.5 but I'm telling you guys this thing can move you know the the stable coin dominance can move quickly for instance back in you know back in October it was at 8% and then two weeks later it had dropped all the way down to 6.7% so down 1.2 in two weeks it's already down from 6% to 5 a half% in one week alone so you know if you dropped if this dropped another half% and came in at at 5% I mean you can see how it's not that far away from the trend line and so I I I think that's you know something relevant to think about as well um something else that I you know I I wanted to mention is is looking at it through the lens of total right if you look at the total market cap of crypto you can see I mean if you if you look at this channel here I mean you can pretty clearly see that that that local top on USD or sorry the local bottom on usdt dominance back in that QT bull market in 2019 occurred at the midpoint of the trend line and we're still not there I mean it it would still require and there's no guarantee that we get there uh there's also no guarantee that we stop there but that would put you a little bit higher right I mean not not even just a little bit I mean that that's actually another that'd be another another 20% move now of course those things as much as we would like them to be guaranteed are not necessarily guaranteed we've seen other patterns before where you know Bitcoin puts in a high like right here and then gets and then gets a few weeks in a row where it actually go sweeps the high so I don't think we can take necessarily anything to the bank my point and I I've said this before is that the way I navigate the market is to just keep my portfolio Bitcoin heavy as opposed to altcoin heavy because I expect Bitcoin dominance to go up I expect Bitcoin to absorb that liquidity from the rest of the market and it I mean it certainly continues to do that um I mean look at you look at all USD valuations they look great all right I mean in terms of just today right I mean a lot of them are up a few percent now look at Bitcoin valuations you can see that a lot of them are down and if you look at collectively all Bitcoin valuations you can see that they've now broken below their own bull market support band and in the last cycle it was precisely when alt broke down against Bitcoin below the range low that Bitcoin had finally accomplished its goal and then it actually had a a longer cool off period you know one of the great things about Bitcoin point is how long the volatility can last but then at some point it you know the market cools off and I think that that cool off phase could occur after all Bitcoin pairs have finally broken down remember last cycle Bitcoin did not cool off until the Bitcoin dominance retraced to the 0. five retracement from the breakdown point this cycle that would correspond to approximately 56% so I still think there's some things that Bitcoin needs to get done like breaking eth Bitcoin down I think that is likely going to happen as well it's still at 053 um and that doesn't mean that it has to break down immediately it certainly could but I mean you can see that it a lot of times when it gets in these levels it takes a long time for it to get back down to the range lows and at least last cycle all Bitcoin pairs broke down before eth Bitcoin broke down so I think that would sort of be a telltell sign if all Bitcoin pairs break down then you know perhaps a few weeks later we would see eth Bitcoin break down but you know that still could be some time away um and I I think for now we'll see we'll see what Bitcoin can do here if you look at a fib retracement from the highs so we we mentioned that if we can hold here at the 0 five then eventually we there's a good chance we're just going to go right back up to the 618 right and in fact that's actually you know I mean I'm not I I we don't have to stop at the 618 I mean let me be clear in fact I mean if if eth Bitcoin hasn't broken down by then then you can make the case that it won't but if you look at at last cycle I mean we we went up to the 618 we then went all the way back down um you know to near the 382 then back up to the 618 here we went up to the 618 we we didn't even make it to the 382 we made it somewhere in between 382 and the 0.5 retracement and now we've gone right back up now the reason why the bull market support ban is important in this context is that normally what you would like to see in in uptrends is you would like to see a a periodic retest of it to go check in with it to make sure it holds that support and often times we like to do it every three to you know three to four months okay because we haven't gone to it yet it's now been 16 weeks right so we're already at the 4month Mark more or less and the issue is that you know eventually if we don't retest it soon then there's a higher probability that by the time we to we do test it we could be too far gone to hold it as support the the same thing happened in 2021 right I mean like we went um far too long it was 31 weeks so about twice the amount of time that we're at right now it was 31 weeks in in 2019 we saw something similar right where we just simply didn't test it for a long time and after getting above it right here it took took 25 weeks to get back down to it and at that point we were just simply too far gone to you know to um to hold it as support and so I don't I mean if we were to go back down and test it right now I I think we're still in the window where it could theoretically hold as support because it's still only been about 4 months and there are there are examples in the past I I believe where it we it took about um about four months before between tests like right here might be an example yeah about 15 to 16 weeks right and then here we left it right there we tested it that was about 12 weeks later um but here when it took 18 weeks you can see ultimately we did not hold it as support so we're still arguably in the window but if you know if the having narrative takes over which we said there's a good chance that it will because this Market is is chasing ing one narrative to another if the having narrative takes over and and we see a Bitcoin move into the having um then by the time you actually test the 20we ese it could be it could be a lot harder to hold it as support but again I mean this is something that we'll likely have to revisit I mean if if it doesn't come back down any time you know pretty quickly then we'll have to Simply revisit it a few months from now um because a lot of times what we've seen is you know after Bitcoin gets a push back up it then takes a while for it to you know for it to bleed back down to the bullmark sport pend and so you know if that happens again then you know the time frame on actually testing the 20 week could be you know the F month Mark the six Monon Mark the seventh month I mean you know you can see how quickly it could get pretty far out there um if it took as long as 2019 did then 31 weeks would put you out in May and and I I've I've suggested may as a as sort of an an area of Interest a few times because it's after the having and and so that will sort of be behind us and it's after theoretically we get the the news about whether an an eth spot ETF is approved or not um and so I I I think that could be the time um and by the way you know if you look at at at last at this move over here it started in October and then it eventually broke down in May here it started in October and so I you know you have to wonder like is it is it doing something similar where it stays elevated for too long and then when it holds the 20we ese or tries to hold it at whatever point you know perhaps it doesn't actually hold um but again that could still be that could still be some some time off in the meantime if you know if this just turns out to be a wick or something like you know if if it turns out to be something like this or or like this then you know there's still a good chance it would take a while to fade back into the bmark span or if it is doing something like this right where it just pops back up to sweep the prior High the thing that I would look for honestly is just keep an eye on all Bitcoin pairs because I I think I mean I yes there's some there's some outside money coming in there's obviously despite ETFs um and we we've seen the stable coin market cap go up but as long as all Bitcoin pairs haven't broken down then you could still argue there's that liquidity from the altcoin market that is there to help support Bitcoin and I know what a lot of people are saying well saying well you know altcoins are also up today yes they are but the Bitcoin dominance is up you know to 53 and a half% um so yeah you have to keep it all you know sort of in context of yes and we've said this many times if Bitcoin goes up it can take the altcoin market with it right that's always been the case it can take the altcoin market with it but the only way that the altcoin market really goes up is if Bitcoin goes up first and you know for that reason that's why we we focus so much on preserving the Satoshi valuation of your portfolio by having a Bitcoin heavy portfolio and that again I'm not trying to suggest that if you want to take on the risk of ALS I'm not trying to say you can't um or you shouldn't it just depends on what your risk tolerance is I've outlined the reasons that I think a Bitcoin heavy portfolio has made sense over the last two years compared to an altcoin heavy portfolio you either buy it or you don't um and at this point if you haven't been convinced then you're probably not going to be convinced and unfortunately some people will finally become convinced probably assuming we do get close to 60% dominance by the time they're convinced it could be very well time for the altcoin market to take back some of that market share but I mean timing is everything when it comes to all Bitcoin valuations and you know I know we went into this year and a lot of people were hopeful that altcoins would sort of take back over it being the having year but since we haven't gone back to looser monetary policy as we said and with the having coming up in April it seems like we've just shifted right back to bitcoin which is something that was always going to be the most likely outcome given the The Narrative driven price action right spot ETF price rallies into that eth merge eth Bitcoin rallied into that like the eth Bitcoin ratio Bitcoin having right same idea now with the merge ethusd topped out one month before the merge but e Bitcoin topped out on the day of the merge so we have to keep that in mind as well and then we also know that at least last cycle when Bitcoin was rallying in 2019 during AED Pauls it didn't top out until one month before the First Rate cut I don't know when the First Rate Cuts going to be um it to some degree it's the game of chicken I think between Powell and the markets but right now the expectation is for a rate cut in May but just a few months ago the expectation was for a rate cut in March and now the March rate cut has almost been completely priced out so again it's really hard to say when it's going to happen I still think it's a game of chicken more or less between the markets and and the Federal Reserve so let's see where Bitcoin ends up here if you go back and look at the 8we moving average you can see that we got below it but we got right back above it the following you know we got right back above it a couple weeks later and this is something that that has happened before um there there was an example previously where we got below it and then we got right back above it and there's also examples where we got below it right here where we then got back above it and then put in a new local high and then came down to the bullmark sport band right and that let's see how long that took so that one took about 18 weeks so that's why you know that's why I say we're still in the window right we're still in the window at 16 weeks but if if we don't test if we don't test the bull market support fan within the next month or so then I I think the likelihood just starts to go up that we won't hold it whenever that test eventually happens if it if it happens in February or March perhaps there's a chance that we hold it if it doesn't happen until May or something then the odds go up that we don't and again and even then it's not a Shir thing but just looking at prior history you want to test it every two to three months four months you know Max um in order to realistically have a you know go into the the the test of the 20we ese with a lot of confidence um but right now I mean right now we we still haven't we still haven't tested it we did get somewhat close um but I mean not I mean even then you'd still like to see it go all the way down there and this was still a couple percent away from the 21 we EMA and even further away from the 20we SMA right I mean 2 and a half% from the 20we EMA 21 we EMA from the 20we ese it was about a 5% thing and you know I I I even said to you know to to to people on ITC premium when we rallied into the spot ETF when we went above the 6 wristband and some you know and some people lightened their their their stack when we got back down to 39K I was like look guys if you if you're light on your your you know your your your your Bitcoin portfolio this might be the only correction that we get for a few weeks right you know your your your 20% drop because that's what every correction has been so far you know doesn't matter if you want it to go down more that's just what these Corrections have been about a 20 to 21% drop and sometimes you take what you can get um so those are my views on bitcoin I I I think that the main thing to watch is Bitcoin dominance which we'll do a video on um remember last cycle Bitcoin the uptrend was intact until the 0.5 retracement which was around 56% dominance for this cycle last cycle that corresponded to well over 56% dominance this cycle would correspond to 56% dominance I also think keep an eye on all Bitcoin valuations as long as they haven't broken down then there still is liquidity that's making its way over to bitcoin which is still you know it has been a Tailwind for Bitcoin USD for altcoins total 3 minus usdt Bitcoin look for that 4 40% right now it's at 44% it's almost at 43% okay look for that and then finally look at at eth Bitcoin because eth Bitcoin is you know also I think needs to eventually break down and at least historically the last two cycles it was a Bitcoin rally that broke each Bitcoin off of support and you can see right now in the context of these rallies it's breaking a lot of altcoins down I mean just look at this yes there's a couple that are up um but even the ones that are up are only barely up like a quarter of a percent or so or less the ones that are down most of them are down 2 or 3% right and poor Litecoin is down almost 4% link Bitcoin is down 3 and a half% BNB 2.6% down so I would I would watch those as long as they haven't yet broken down collectively there's there's still that liquidity there there and and we'll see you know we'll see what Bitcoin can do here and we'll see how high the dominance can go and we'll see you know if we can sweep these highs or do what we did back over here and go go a bit higher so those are my views on the market right now I honestly can't tell you exactly where it's going to to cool off from what I have said for for months now is that when it gets into these moves you're you're better off just trying to get out of the way and not you know not constantly try to time things because often times you know Bitcoin goes higher than we think and then often times it goes lower than we think um and again you know in 2019 you know Bitcoin rallied 350% um during that QT late business cycle phase right now it's gone up about 216% so I mean at this point this rally was actually more impressive than this one but this one has lasted longer I also there's a good chance that it's also lasted longer because we actually haven't shifted over to looser you know looser monetary policy where where the market fundamentals have at least last cycle changed anyways we'll go we'll go ahead and wrap it up thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe crypto.com I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-02-09 00:00:00,"The video provides a detailed technical analysis of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, focusing on its price movements, dominance, and relationship with altcoins. The speaker discusses the importance of Bitcoin's 50-day moving average, the potential implications of a larger correction, the dominance of stablecoins like USDT, and the significance of Bitcoin's performance relative to altcoins. The overall sentiment is bullish, with the speaker suggesting that Bitcoin's dominance is likely to increase and that altcoins may struggle to outperform Bitcoin in the short term. The main message is that Bitcoin's trend remains intact, and investors should focus on preserving their Satoshi valuation by maintaining a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio.",132,"[0.053253174, 0.0093307495,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin but within the context of net liquidity if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe crypto.com link is in the description below let's go ahead and jump in so net liquidity is this idea that we've discussed before not only within the context of of Bitcoin but also within the context of the stock market and really I I think that while it can be useful for looking at USD evaluations of risk assets I think net liquidity is more interesting when you look at relative valuations of certain risk assets against other risk assets and I I'll try to explain what I mean but the first thing I want to do is we're just going to pull up the indicator okay so we have net liquid right here and if you're not famili familiar with what this is I'm essentially adding up the balance sheet of several different central banks including not only the the fed you know the United States but also Canada New Zealand Japan China the UK the ECB Australia so those are the ones that we have included and I'm also subtracting out the reverse repo and the TGA from the from the United States so by doing all that we get a metric that looks like this okay now to show you a specific balance sheet if you were to go look at say the FED right if you were to go look at at this one you can see pretty clearly that the FED has been reducing the size of their balance sheet really ever since 2022 there was this pop up here in March of 2023 I'm sure you guys remember that but it's mostly been moving down so why then has net liquidity not been moving down in the same manner right you can see that net liquidity while it has moved down it hasn't really moved down as quickly as the balance sheet from the Federal Reserve one of the reasons is because when you look at at net liquidity at least in the United States you also have to consider the reverse repo facility and the treasury general account the TGA and if you do that if you look at say the reverse repo what you'll notice is that it has been aggressive ly coming down but with reverse repo you almost have to think about it in reverse if this is going down then liquidity is being put back into the market so that that for that reason you're subtracting you take total assets from the fed and you subtract out the reverse repo so as long as this keeps moving down liquidity is being continuously pumped in now you might have seen a lot of people are talking about when is this going to run out people are speculating all sorts of times they used to say it was going to run out in January obviously we're past that and it's still at half a trillion uh so I don't know you know I don't know exactly what the path for it is but you can see this is one of the reasons that the the the net liquidity hasn't gone much further down another reason is of course the treasury general account and I'll go ahead and and paste that in here as well and that looks like this right it's actually gone up recently so the point is if you take if you take the balance sheet of the fed and from here we subtract out the reverse repo so let me pull this up um that one and then we subtract out the TGA you get something that looks like this right now when you look at this you can see that that actually looks a lot similar to this than if you only include the balance sheet of the FED but there are still some differences for instance this was a lower low compared to this which was a higher low so why is that well remember we're also looking at the balance sheet of a lot of central banks not just the Federal Reserve we also have Canada so if I pull up that one you can see what it looks like sorry that's the wrong one um here's Canada Central the the balance sheet there you can see that it's been going down pretty steadily um and we also have many many others one of the ones that's actually been going up though is China go look at the the balance sheet of um in China you can see this actually been going up quite aggressively but one issue is that this is denominated in local currencies right so if you're going to add up the balance sheets of various central banks then you have to convert it back to US Dollars and that's where the dollar comes into play right like where the dollar you have you we have to understand you know what is the dollar doing and since the dollar has come it it initially came down quite a lot but in recent weeks is starting to go back up now if it goes up that sucks liquidity out okay if you think about if if a if a central bank has favorable conversion to US Dollars then that means there's more purchasing power okay but if the dollar has gained strength against those local currencies then that means there's less Pur power from those you know so from those balance sheets of the other central banks so the dollar also plays a role but at the end of the day you get a chart that looks like this right you get a chart that looks like this and for a long time during a business cycle especially you know especially when when the drop begins as net liquidity goes down for a while risk assets will track net liquidity right we can overlay this and and see it pretty clearly right for a while RIS RK assets like Bitcoin like the S&P will track net liquidity but every single cycle eventually what we've seen is there there becomes a Divergence between them right where one will you know the risk asset will diverge from net liquidity and this is a reason why there's a lot of people that really dismiss the idea of net liquidity because of this Divergence I mean of course you could look at prior cycles and say yeah well you know it it does diverge at some point but given enough time the asset will tend to go back to that level the problem is that can take years right and you know if you're if you're counting on that as your investment thesis and that alone then you could be you know just simply waiting around four years waiting to see if something actually plays out or not it could be better visualized with say like the S&P 500 last cycle right I mean if you look at what the S&P let me switch this over to not a monthly time frames there's a little bit more resolution in it um I mean like like last cycle you can see that at at some point the jaws of liquidity opened and eventually they snap shut right again they they the jaws of liquidity opened here and then eventually they snap shut so you might look at this and say well what use is it right what use is it if the risk asset in question can diverge from net liquidity and I I think there's actually a great answer to that question and it all goes back to to what happens in late business cycle types of environment and what happens is higher risk assets bleed to lower risk assets right we've seen that not only have we seen it with like altcoins bleeding back to bitcoin right if you like at total three out by Bitcoin not only do you see total 3 continues to bleed back to bitcoin but also things like the Russell are bleeding back to the NASDAQ right you can see this is the Russell going back down you know bleeding against the NASDAQ and so there's this idea that you know rather than use net liquidity to understand risk asset valuations on their USD pairs you can use net liquidity to understand likely outcomes of higher risk assets to lower risk assets for instance taking a look at the ether Bitcoin pair right the eth Bitcoin pair now I do consider Bitcoin to be a safer investment than ethereum that doesn't mean that I'm not long-term optimistic about ethereum's chances but what I do mean is that the ethereum valuation has been and we've we've talked about it for years and will likely continue to bleed back to bitcoin until we go back to loci monetary policy and when you look at the chart in this manner it actually seems to line up a bit a bit more closely right and maybe switch over The Ether the eth chart to a line scale and and let me actually move this back so we can actually see you know really what's going on here um what you'll notice you see here how eth Bitcoin kind of put in a slightly lower low same idea with net liquidity now remember net liquidity has nothing to do with the eth valuation right it's concerned about the balance sheet of C the the the the central bank's balance sheet and also it does take into account the dollar but you can see pretty clearly in a chart like this where net liquidity can be actually useful because it shows you that a higher risk asset in the crypto space ethereum has been bleeding to a lower risk asset Bitcoin right and it's and it's basically mimicking the net liquidity model where you can see that as net liquidity goes down so too does the eth Bitcoin valuation but ethereum is by a long shot not the riskiest asset in crypto in fact after Bitcoin it's probably the safest one after Bitcoin Bitcoin being the safest then ethereum then there's the altcoin market now if you were to look at it through the lens of the altcoin market let me um pull it up over here and again if you look at total three just the USD valuation it tends to line up better with net liquidity but it's still not a perfect match but what I would say is go look at total three minus the St you know minus usdt and then divide that by Bitcoin and when you do something like that you get a chart that looks like this and here you can see how it lines up a lot more closely I mean it's not perfect I'm not trying to imply that it is but here you can really see how altcoins are bleeding back to bitcoin right this white line shows relative all Bitcoin valuation and you can see clearly how all Bitcoin valuations are bleeding and you can also see how net liquidity continues to go down now all of this is important as an investor because if you're if you're if you are an investor and you're like and you like taking on risk you always want to know where should you put your money to maximize your risk adjusted returns if you think about what's happened over the last couple of years the Magnificent s in the S&P 500 is essentially the only reason why the S&P is even at new all-time highs is because of these few stocks that have outperformed most of the rest of the market however there are many times in history where this is exactly the case where higher risk assets or sorry where where only a few stocks in the S&P 500 outperform and those are the ones that are responsible for taking the S&P higher a lot of people might point to this to say well this is the only reason but that's how it often happens and that's one of the reasons why out out performing the S&P 500 is incredibly difficult because unless you can pick the exact stocks that are going to give all the gains there's a good chance that you end up picking some stocks that just keep on going down and that's why most hedge funds do not even keep Pace with the S&P 500 is because they're not better stock Pickers than you know just buying the index I mean and this is not my just not my opinion I mean this has been proven time and time again we've seen reports you know at the end of fiscal years where it'll show you you know how many how many hedge funds have actually outform that the S&P that year and it's always really few right and they have a lot of smart people at these hedge funds I'm sure trying to make all sorts of decisions and there are some that do occasionally outperform but even the ones that outperform for a while they tend to not outperform for many many years in a row again every once in a while you'll find one that does but the problem is that most of them ultimately fail to even keep Pace with the S&P 500 so my argument is that you can use this idea of net liquidity to better understand which types of assets are worth owning for the last couple of years I've reiterated many times that my crypto portfolio is basically just Bitcoin and I have been very critical of of alt Bitcoin pairs for a long time I do want to remind people that there are always a few altcoins that outperform and I I congratulate anyone who's made a lot of money in the altcoin market okay a lot of altcoins have moved up off of their lows and I'm not trying to diminish the risk that someone took on and then the the the reward that they received I saw the exact same thing last cycle and last cycle I was a lot heavier in the alt Queen Market than I am this cycle but what happened last cycle is I just saw these altcoins bleed back to Bitcoin in until the FED started to cut rates so you might wonder well when will altcoins finally stop this horrendous downtrend against Bitcoin right when will it end and one way to view that is to Simply look at at at interest rates right I mean you could go look pretty clearly at interest rates and see right away that at least last cycle if you look at last cycle and we pull up say total three divided by Bitcoin the altcoin market um against Bitcoin sorry actually let me pull it up I want to pull it up the other way I going to pull it up so that so here we have the altcoin market right against Bitcoin and what I want to do is I want to Overlay interest rates onto this chart so you can see pretty clear clearly here that once the FED started to cut rates right here altcoins were pretty close to bottoming out against Bitcoin they still had a little bit to go but what's more interesting is if you also overlay the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve you can see that they started to increase the size of their balance sheet precisely at the time that all Bitcoin pairs finally bottomed out which again corresponds if we pull up that indicator again uh net liquidity indicator right here you can see that that Loosely corresponds to near the lows in net liquidity so when we think about net liquidity are we using it to tell us USD valuations of risk assets no we've talked many times about this with n liquidity and how the jaws of liquidity will open at some point during the business cycle so if you're only using liquidity to tell you where the Market's going to go you're probably going to be in for a bad time but if you use net liquidity to give you an idea of where relative valuations of risk assets against other risk assets are going to go I think that makes a lot more sense and that way if you're an investor you can focus your money on the lower risk assets if you want some exposure to the upside while also minimizing your downside risk right and so pretty clearly right here this is where net liquidity bottomed in September of 2019 right you can see that's where net liquidity bottomed last cycle and that's precisely where all Bitcoin pairs bottomed out themselves isn't that fascinating and so when you look at at a chart like this it really does make a lot more sense you he here you can see how altcoins outperformed Bitcoin as net liquidity went through the roof but then as net liquidity goes down all Bitcoin pairs go down and a lot of people keep calling the top on on bitcoin dominance because of of you know what they saw happen um or or sort of they're they're thinking that altcoins will will perform better this time but my point is last cycle we can I mean again it's only one data point but it's it's technically more than one data point if you think about it because this same type of idea is could be studied for various markets going back many many centuries right the idea that in in late business cycle environments higher risk assets bleed to lower risk assets and the reason for that is because the higher risk asset we are pretty confident Will Survive what you know whether it's a no Landing whether it's a soft Landing or whether it's a hard Landing right whatever three whatever type of Landing it is out of those three you know you you expect the the the the lower risk asset to survive but what you don't right you expect you would expect meta or alphabet or apple you would or Microsoft right you would expect those to survive because you know they have a healthy balance sheet so you're not really that concerned okay now could you say the same thing about a random company that only started up a couple years ago and has not had the time to build up a healthy balance sheet can you say the same thing about that company and the problem is that we can't but as investors that are seeking out risk if you want to put your money somewhere if you're seeking out yield if you want to find a home for it what a lot of people do is they go to the lower risk asset during quantitative tightening and during a late business business cycle environment because two reasons first of all investors want to take risks right and they want to enjoy on the upside second of all they want to minimize their downside risk if there is a hard Landing right because if there's a hard Landing everything gets rinsed but at least the the lower risk stuff won't get rinsed as bad and it'll probably be pretty quick to recover so that's where we are right we continue to be in that type of environment where it's late business cycle and what I mean by late business cycle is I just mean that in terms of interest rates right like this yellow line in terms of interest rates like mid 2019 was late business cycle because it was just before the FED started to cut so that's what I mean by late business cycle is we're we're we're sort of coming up on on rate cuts at some point this year we don't know exactly when that's going to be and good chance right now that it's not even going to be in March so if it's not going to be in March then perhaps the next best time is May and that would imply that Bitcoin dominance could continue to go up for a while and when it comes to to bitcoin we know that what it really likes to do what it really likes to do is it it likes to to to sort of break risk it it likes to break all Bitcoin pairs down during rallies right so if it goes up I mean I drew it out here right but if it goes up then it breaks all Bitcoin pairs down or if it goes down then it breaks all Bitcoin pairs down but for a long time it is just simply gone up during this late business cycle environment and a lot of these altcoins simply bleed back to bitcoin and my argument is that we will likely see that shift on the other side of monetary policy when we get back to looser rates or looser monetary policy lower rates that that Trend will likely shift but until that time I think the status quo will remain unchanged and so net liquidity I think is a great indicator to understand the current market cycle I think people may go astray when they use it to tell them where USD valuations are going to go when in reality it's much better tool for better understanding where the relative valuations of higher risk assets are going to go compared to lower risk assets and so that is what I want to talk about today with net liquidity hopefully you guys found that useful again if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse Doom I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-02-08 00:00:00,"The video discusses the concept of net liquidity, which is a metric that aggregates the balance sheets of several central banks, including the Federal Reserve, and subtracts the reverse repo and the Treasury General Account (TGA) in the United States. The presenter argues that net liquidity is more useful for understanding the relative valuations of different risk assets, such as cryptocurrencies, rather than their absolute USD valuations.The presenter explains that while the Federal Reserve's balance sheet has been decreasing, net liquidity has not declined as quickly due to the impact of the reverse repo facility and the TGA. The presenter also notes that the balance sheets of other central banks, such as Canada and China, play a role in the net liquidity metric.The presenter suggests that during late-cycle business environments, higher-risk assets tend to bleed into lower-risk assets, such as Bitcoin. This is demonstrated by the presenter's analysis of the Ethereum-Bitcoin and altcoin-Bitcoin pairs, which appear to track the net liquidity indicator more closely than their USD valuations.The presenter concludes that using net liquidity can help investors understand where relative valuations of risk assets are likely to go, rather than trying to use it to predict the overall direction of the market. The presenter remains bullish on Bitcoin and believes that altcoins will continue to bleed against Bitcoin until the Federal Reserve shifts to a more accommodative monetary policy.The main message of the transcript is that net liquidity can be a useful tool for understanding the relative performance of different risk assets, particularly in late-cycle business environments, and that investors should focus on lower-risk assets like Bitcoin during periods of quantitative tightening.",324,"[-0.026184082, 0.013580322, -0.044525146, 0.024734497, 0.011070251, -0.019561768, 0.009895325,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing Wikipedia page views if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse docomo that will hopefully help you navigate the crypto verse just a bit better one interesting thing is that we can track social interest I mean we we've done videos on the social risk before but we can track social interest quite easily by looking at you know views to to to YouTube channels and and new followers on Twitter to people that talk about cryptocurrency this is just simply looking at new Wikipedia page views to the to the Bitcoin page and what what's fascinating is that you can see that during the 2017 Peak it spiked quite high and in fact it went a lot higher in 2017 than it did over here in 2021 now there is an explanation for that I think and that is that as crypto has grown as an asset class there's obviously a lot of other cryptocurrencies as well and so while we did not get a spike on the search term or the Wikipedia page for Bitcoin in 2021 if you were to go look at cryptocurrency you can see that there was a very similar spike in 2021 around that first Peak just like there was in 2017 and in fact if you look even recently we've seen it slowly trending back up it looks like it found um at least for the the search the page of cryptocurrency you can see that it found some these lows back in April and it has been trending higher although at least in recent days it's starting to go back down now that the spot ETF stuff is behind us of course with the with the having around the corner we could still see that interest come right back but it might be interesting to Overlay all of them right so now what we're looking at is the sum of you know these pages that look at not only Bitcoin page and the cryptocurrency page but also ethereum as well as many others and when you do that you get a chart that looks like this which is interesting from the perspective of major Peak here on Wikipedia page views in 2017 very similar thing in 2021 but there hasn't really been a whole lot of interest for a while right I mean now price has gone up the price of Bitcoin has gone up but there's not a lot of people searching for cryptocurrency right now so the social interest Still Remains relatively relatively low it's like when we talk about the social risk and you know what is it going to take to get people interested right what is it going to take retail participants interested in crypto again that are not already here you might say well hey I'm interested but there's a difference between say someone that stuck around for all of 2022 and all of 2023 and they're just still here right there's a difference between that type of person and the person that only joined in the first peak of 2021 lost all their money in the summer crash and then just left right and you can see I mean it's it's pretty clear that those people have not returned right you can see that they have not in terms of in terms of search interest and of course this is also seen in in YouTube views and and and throughout various metrics but I think it's an interesting way to look at the cryptoverse to just get an idea of of of where we are in terms of the social sentiment in the space and you know is it trending up is it trending down or is it relatively sideways I think you could argue that uh it was trending down in 2022 or late 2021 trending down throughout most of 2022 but it seems like it's it's been relatively flat um you know for about a year now I mean it it did get some spikes over here going into the spot ETF stuff but it is still it has still been relatively flat a couple of things to note is that this Spike over over here in 2021 of course occurred after the having and it it occurred during loose monetary policy same thing over here this Spike occurred in 2017 it occurred after the having and it occurred during loose monetary policy so perhaps one of the reasons we haven't seen a you know a a similar type of spike is because we are before the having and we have also not seen the shift to looser monetary policy so perhaps those are the two ingredients that you need and it could be sort of representative of the idea that price is not the only thing that brings brings people back I mean Bitcoin has gone up what 3x from the from the from the 2022 lows and and still the search interest for all these cryptocurrencies Still Remains relatively flat so to me it implies that there's something more to it and and that you need you know you need looser monetary policy which conveniently also often corresponds to the having which Maybe by chance maybe by maybe not also happens to be an election year right we talk about like that cyclical behavior of of crypto and and you can kind of see it pretty clearly on this chart that you you get that interest at least in terms of Wikipedia page views to these assets after the having but it also tends to correspond to lose to monetary policy and even in 2019 you can see there was all sorts of positive price action where Bitcoin actually went up more in 2019 than it has throughout this entire rally over here because back over here it went up more than 3x from the lows and you can see that interest still didn't really come back until the very end of the having year right in the early part of the post having year and even over here you can see that while Bitcoin was going up for a while even in the having year it didn't really start to go up until halfway through the post having year so just interesting you know some interesting ways to look at the market hopefully this has been you know insightful uh to you guys to be the market like this again if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-02-05 00:00:00,"The video discusses the analysis of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related Wikipedia page views as a proxy for social interest in the crypto market. The key points are:1. Wikipedia page views for Bitcoin spiked significantly during the 2017 bull run, but the 2021 spike was not as high, likely due to the growth of other cryptocurrencies.
2. Overlaying the page views for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the general cryptocurrency page shows a similar pattern of major peaks in 2017 and 2021, but relatively flat interest since then despite the recent price recovery.
3. The presenter suggests that the spikes in social interest tend to occur after Bitcoin's halving events and during periods of loose monetary policy, implying that these factors, rather than just price action, are important drivers of retail participation.
4. The lack of a similar spike in social interest during the 2022-2023 price recovery is seen as a potential concern, as it may indicate that many of the new participants from the 2021 peak have since left the market.
5. The overall sentiment is cautious, as the presenter suggests that something more than just price appreciation is needed to bring back widespread retail interest in the crypto market.In summary, the video analyzes cryptocurrency-related Wikipedia page views as a proxy for social interest, and concludes that while prices have recovered, the lack of a corresponding spike in social interest may be a concerning sign for the crypto market.",287,"[0.035827637, 0.017623901, -0.023406982, 0.00504303, 0.015525818, -0.046539307, 0.02961731, -0.0357666, 0.032073975, 0.017791748, -0.038757324,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the hotle waves or hotel waves whichever you prefer if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom let's go ahead and jump in so the hotle waves are an interesting metric to use use because they allow us to investigate whether people are selling in terms of long-term holders or if they're not or if speculation is so rampant that there's a lot of new short-term holders and so when you look at the chart like this it can be hard to make head or tail heads or Tales of what's really going on but we can sort this by long-term holders and short-term holders so this is what long-term holders look like the hotle waves and in this instance we're defining long-term holders as anyone who has held Bitcoin in their wallet for at least six months and what you will know notice is that during Mania phases at Major Peaks that occur every few years the long-term holder hotle wave starts to go down and one of the reasons for that of course is because people who have been holding on to their Bitcoin for a longer period of Time start to sell into that now you can see that there have been rallies in the past where the long-term holders sold into those moves but you may notice that in 2019 when we had about a 4X move the long-term holders continue to hold even through another you know 50 60 70% draw down I think the reason for that is because a lot of times longer term holders don't tend to sell until Bitcoin breaks new highs right and um that's why like in 2019 a lot of people sort of watch that peak come and go but not a lot of people really sold into to it because it did not actually break the all-time high but when we did break the all-time high you can see that the longer term holders of Bitcoin really sold into that and what's really fascinating is if you look at the reverse short-term holders so basically anyone who has held Bitcoin um less than six months you can see that the Peaks on long-term holders or sorry on short-term holders tend to top out right around Bitcoin Peaks so new retail enters into the market aggressively leads to a Mania phase and then they are pretty quick to leave and in 2019 you can see that there was not really a big push up in this metric but you can see that was there in 2021 when we broke to new alltime highs you can also see that in 2017 we got this major move up after we broke through to new alltime highs you could also go isolate individual ones let's say the one year to the 2-year and try to observe Trends there as well for instance you can see that in in this case they tend to I mean you can see previously they T this one tended to bottom out at Major Peaks right it bottomed out here at this peak it bottomed out here at this peak it bottomed out at this peak and then bottomed out over here out around this Pak what's interesting though is is that in this case there was you know it it it made this strong move up and then it basically just sort of slowly goes down until until sort of the peak is there and what's interesting is this metric at around Prior Peaks last cycle you know reached somewhere between 9 to 10% cycle before that and the 7 to eight cycle before that around 9% or so right now it's currently at around 14% so just another metric to keep in mind we're going to keep this video short I'm actually pretty sick I'm sure you can tell but I did want to at least put a video out um right now and and this is one of those metrics that we do occasionally talk about uh so I just wanted to provide an update on it thank you guys you guys get it I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-02-03 00:00:00,"The video discusses the HODL waves metric, which analyzes the behavior of long-term and short-term Bitcoin holders. It explains that during market manias, long-term holders tend to sell, while short-term speculators drive the price up. However, in 2019, long-term holders continued to hold even through a significant drawdown, as they typically don't sell until new all-time highs are reached. The video also notes that the 1-2 year HODL wave metric has reached around 14% currently, compared to 9-10% in previous cycles, suggesting increased long-term holder conviction. The overall sentiment is cautiously bullish, as the analysis of HODL waves provides insights into the market dynamics and the potential for further Bitcoin price appreciation.The main message and conclusion is that the HODL waves metric can be used to gauge the behavior of long-term and short-term Bitcoin holders, which provides valuable insights into the market's underlying dynamics and the potential for future price movements.",203,"[0.05050659, -0.004814148, 0.024841309, 0.022018433, 0.0057411194, -0.008110046, 0.0463562, -0.06628418, 0.024719238, 0.018844604, 0.03149414, -0.009277344,

hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the macroverse today we're going to talk about the fomc meeting that occurred earlier today talk about a little bit about what Powell said expectations now going forward for interest rates and and maybe look at a few other things if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium add into Toth cryptoverse decom let's go and jump in so I know that the uh the fomc videos are a little bit dry uh but I do think it's important information to consider so essentially the FED has kept interest rates surprise surprise unchanged again and if you were to go take a look at uh the FED funds rate I mean you can see that we are now uh many months into this and in fact March will be our eth month and the next meeting is actually in March now the reason why that's important is because I believe the median number of months that that the FED has historically paused for after a rate hiking cycle has been eight months and so there has been speculation that if we play out play this cycle out you know on average or sort of the median the median time frame people I think are were sort of hopeful that we might actually get a rate cut in March but I want to talk a little bit more about this uh the um the release here first and and one of the things that they said was that the committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2% now this is a you know it's sort of a a vague comment in in some regards because it's like well what does that mean exactly like what what other measures of confidence do you need and in fact this was asked to him and essentially what what pal said was that what they're seeing right now is what they need to see they just need to see more of it right they need to see it continue to play out like that for a while longer because and let me let me find the quote uh that he said he said we know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even TI monetary policy to get inflation to 2% reducing policy restraint too little too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment so it to me it still seems like they view one of the main risks as inflation not durably getting back to their 2% Target and when pressed about whether he thought inflation could re accelerate which I I do think is a valid question and I think one of the reasons you know it is a valid question is if you were to go look at inflation year-over-year I mean you will very quickly see that there is a period in the 1970s where we had several peaks of inflation just one after another and in fact after the first Peak it came back down to around 3% headline inflation which is where it is today and rather than continuing down to their 2% objective you can see that it actually went back up and what's interesting is it took a very long time to actually get back to their 2% objective you can see that they left 2% back in in really the late in the mid 1960s and it did it headline CPI did not get back below 2% or even around 2% until 1986 so this is the danger that Powell is trying to avoid and I mean I I think it's a reasonable view to have they're worried that if they pivot too quickly and go back to luer mon monetary policy that they're just going to get another wave of inflation and he said that right he said that we we have six good months we have six months of good inflation data but that's not sufficient for them right it's not sufficient for them to Pivot at this point and um you know one of the things that I I know a lot of people were were were thinking about and And discussing was whether there would be a a a rate cut in March and over last month there's certainly been a lot of you know investors thinking that there would be a rate cut in March but poell actually said and I quote I don't think it's likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that in reference to the timing of the First Rate cut and then he went on to talk about how it's not the most likely case that they cut in March he said it's not their base case that they cut in March and I think the reasoning is because you know March isn't far enough away for them to get suff a sufficient number of data points between now and then that would cause them to change their mind I think the main thing that could cause them to change their mind between now and March would be if the labor market were to soften up a lot but I have to imagine and he has admitted as much that he does sometimes find out about these jobs numbers ahead of time I wouldn't be surprised if he already knows some of the data that will come out later this week because he he was previously he did previously admit to sometimes you know getting sort of a tip off on it especially with with such a major decision as as monetary policy in the United States sounds reasonable to me um so maybe he knows where where the labor market data is going to come in for the rest of the week and and perhaps he still views the risk with inflation as you know as as the the thing to be concerned about right I mean and they do go on I mean it does go on to say that like they they acknowledge that if they if they act too late they could you know it could lead to sort of inflation reaccelerating and then to have to even go even to tighter monetary policy take a look at interest rates back you know many many years ago many decades ago in the 1970s and what you'll notice is that you know interest rates first went up to around 13 you know 133% that sounds kind of crazy right 133% I mean we're freaking out today over 5 and a half perc but it's again it's the rate of change right I mean it it started out right it started out at at three and a half% in 1972 And by 1974 it had reached 133% but what happened this was in 1974 the FED eased too soon 1974 and we just got another round of inflation going into the 1980s where they had to raise rates all the way up here now I want you to think about how painful that would be in this cycle right I mean I know if you think about it you go to the you know you go out to a restaurant you go to the store whatever you're doing and you're spending money and just think about how expensive things are compared to where they used to be just a few years ago I mean I don't know about you guys but I can't go to the grocery store anymore without spending twice what I used to spend so it's great that you know asset prices go up sometimes but you know if if asset prices go up 2X and everything that you purchase in this world is 2x more expensive where have we really gone right it's just everything's been inflated so think about how painful it would be if if we experiened something like this where you get a round of inflation uh and and so this is this is uh interest rates right where you get a round of inflation and interest rates go up and then the FED pivots because they see inflation coming back down right and if you look at if you look closely you'll see that they started to cut rates here in the summer of 74 now look at the summer of 74 the summer of 74 was right up here right they started to cut rates we were in a recession and inflation came down thanks to the recession right recessions are really great for bringing inflation back down the problem is 1976 came and inflation just hung out at 5% in 1976 and the Fed was not raising rates in 1976 and you can see that they had to start raising rates again throughout 1976 1977 1978 79 as inflation started going up aggressively again now I know a lot of people you know the whole monetary policy stuff can be kind of boring kind of dry but that is why it's such a big deal is because what happens if they pivot too soon I mean I know a lot of people want them to Pivot to go back to you know to to lose to monetary policy but the problem is if you go back to lose to monetary policy too quickly it could lead to inflation coming back and actually look here in the 1970s after this first Peak where inflation came back down to about 3% which is where it is now you can see that it it after going back down to 3% the market the stock market went up a little bit more but then the stock market crashed has inflation soared again so sometimes you have to be careful for what you wish for when thinking about rate Cuts because if they pivot too soon they run the risk of another wave of inflation right I mean sort of the animal spirits come out and everyone wants to spend money and invest and and you know in everything and that's where things can get dangerous if you know if if sort of the frothy stuff comes back too quickly and then we just get another round of inflation and then you know then the FED has to go even higher speaking of I don't know if you guys remember but well over a year and a half ago we suggested that the terminal rate the cycle would likely be 5 a half% this was back when it was at like you know 1 or 2% back then it was not seen as a likely outcome by many uh that they would go that high but poell did confirm today that they they he said that they do you know they do think they've reached their terminal rate for this business cycle I mean I think that makes sense I don't really think they need to go any higher I think what they need to do is they need to hold here long enough to make sure that inflation is is brought back durably to their 2% Target so a lot of interesting stuff and again you might wonder how does this matter to me as an investor right why should it matter and it all goes back to to sort of what assets are are are are safer right which ones do better during environments like this and I'll I'll again remind you right it's s the higher market cap stuff right the the the the companies that have healthier balance sheets money tends to flock to those right you've heard the Magnificent 7 and one of the reasons why companies like Apple and Google and uh or you know and or alphabet and and meta Microsoft right one of the reasons Nvidia one of the reasons why those do so well is because they have a lot of cash on hand right I mean they have good business models too they have a lot of cash on hand and so even if the FED were to raise you know Even If the Fed were to hold rates here for a year there's still a good chance that I mean a great chance right more than just a great chance right but there's a really really high probability that all those companies will survive right they could survive way more than just the FED causing keeping rates at 5 and a half percent for a couple years okay so when you're an investor and you're thinking about where do I put my money you know do you go put it in a a well-known company right like one of the major tech stocks that you're pretty confident will still be here next business cycle or do you take the risk and put it in some micro cap business that may or may not survive right and so what a lot of investors decide to do rather than invest in in smaller market cap companies that have maybe they don't have the best balance sheet because they just haven't had time to grow to the size of apple or they don't have you know the same type of innovation but you get the idea right A lot of these companies they're a fraction of the size of of these larger Mega cap Tech companies and there's no guarantee they're going to survive until the next business cycle it all depends on how long the FED keeps rates at 5 and a half% I'm sure you've seen all sorts of charts on on on Twitter or X showing you know the number of of you know delinquencies Rising the number of bankruptcies Rising right so we know that's happening and that's one of the reasons why the FED has to keep a close eye on things because if they hold too long then that sort of stuff can can move up exponentially right and that's what's happened previously if they hold rates too long then the economy sort of tilts into a Slowdown and then when you cut rat 25 basis points is not going to do a thing I mean you have to cut several hundred basis points to have a a material effect on on the economy I mean think about it you know think about all the small businesses out there right now that are struggling and and maybe some of you watching this video own your own small business and and maybe you've seen sales slow down this year compared to say you know last year or the year before you know is a 25 basis point rate cut going to magically solve things probably not but you know two to 300 basis points of rate Cuts probably could solve a few problems if you think about it if you're like in the market to buy a car a lot of people are are are turned off from buying a car right now because of how high rates are right if you if you go buy a used car or a new car and you get a loan rates are so high that a lot of people get scared into doing so but if rates came down you know two to 300 basis points then they might not be willing or they might be more willing to to go out and do that and so that that's kind of what's happening is that we're we're we've reached this level of monetary policy that poell says is in the restrictive Zone well into the restrictive Zone and it's just a matter of how long can they hold here before they need to go back to looser monetary policy so again how does it infect you as an investor well the the higher risk stuff bleeds to the lower risk stuff right and and you think about it like look at what happened today the S&P 500 was down 1.6% right the Russell right the Russell was down I mean it let me let me pull it up on a because it's already showing sort of recent recent moves if you look at the Russell here this is um the Russell 2000 ETF it dropped almost two and a half% right so I think a lot of the smaller cap stuff didn't really like to hear that the mar the March rate cut might be off the table because I imagine there's a lot of people that are really hoping that we get a rate cut in March to help loosen up monetary policy to to get people more interested in in spending money and and and you know maybe taking loans to buy things like cars or houses whatever it might be so but a lot of the small smaller cap stuff didn't like what Powell had to say and and you can kind of I mean if you look at at at sort of the like a a minute chart which we don't often do you can see just how crazy it was I mean sort of he opened up and early on it was still you know I think markets were still hoping that there would be a March a March uh cut and then when when he when he was specifically asked about it he basically more or less took it off the table I mean it's not entirely off the table but he he basically closed the door on on that idea unless something catastrophic were to happen in the labor market and and a you know basically once he said that you can see that the smaller cap stuff really sold off pretty hard because that Lifeline of a of a of you know that that that QE drug of of the of the dream of going back to looser monetary policy lower interest rates and and money printing was sort of taken off the table and and a lot of the smaller cap stuff didn't like that and the same the same stuff goes to the other you know other asset classes I'm not going to even mention it I think it'll IND do some my roles but you guys know what I'm talking about um it's that the the higher risk stuff bleeds to the lower risk stuff right and and think about it like look at the S&P 500 over the last um you know over the last year or so and look at what it's done now look at the Russell smaller cap stuff right haven't really gone anywhere the market gets excited about potentially getting a rate cut and then it's taken away right Russell hasn't gone anywhere it's still where it has been I mean it's it was at the same valuation in May of 20122 I mean it it really hasn't gone anywhere in about a year and a half and the companies are are you know they're trying to hold on they're they're trying to wait out the storm it just depends on how how much longer it's going to take so again inflation still relatively high but arguably there are some good signs if you were to look at at pce Price Index inflation year be year it's actually backed down to 2.6% so I mean it is getting close to their target I mean it's not like it's that far away it is getting a lot closer um here's core pce believe it was 2.9 yeah 2.9% so it is getting closer but they might they might need you know more than just February's inflation data and March inflation data uh to sort of lower rates and if you look at Market expectations let me go ahead and reload this see where it stands now it looks like Pal's words did have some effect because there there were certainly higher probabilities of a rate cut beforehand now it's about a 65% chance of the market thinking that they hold rates at 5 and a half perc in March and you know about a 35% chance that they that they cut still the market thinks they'll cut by May because there's only about a 6.8% chance that they hold rates in May you know at that level in may as well so Market thinks there's going to be some type of a cut between now and may but we'll see if that changes because once upon a time the market was convinced of a of a March rate cut they've actually said if you look at like the summary of economic projections the SCP the committee members think there will only be three rate Cuts this year that's what a lot of people wrote out in the SCP which is completely is completely different than what the market is saying the market is saying no you're going to cut six times this year six 25 basis point rate Cuts I don't really I mean I I think again I've talked about this before I think we're seeing a bodal distribution here where there's some people that are you know there's some investors that say yeah three rate cuts and then there's other investors that are saying no hard Landing it's going to be several hundred basis points of rate cuts and therefore you get something sort of in between so you're probably not going to get this outcome you're probably not going to get sort of the the either extremes but it'll be something um in between okay so it'll be interesting to see how this how this evolves over the you know over the coming over the next couple of months because um it's changed a lot and and one of the things that poell said was that you know while the supply of he I mean he basically said that the supply of labor let me see if I can get the quote um labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers right if you're not if you're not familiar with what he's referring to if you look here this is job openings divided by the unemployment level so it basically shows you the number of openings the number of job openings per unemployed worker and the ratio has slightly climbed again this month to 1.44 so that implies that for every unemployed worker there's 1.44 job openings okay so and I believe he said right it hasn't even reached the pre-pandemic level yet and he's right I mean pre pandemic this ratio was around 1.2 now it's about 1.4 so we would need to see this come down quite a bit for it to you know to get back to the 1.2 level and then if you're not the two things that go into this you have job openings which I know a lot of people were freaking out because they they actually went back up I'm not sure why I mean it's it's been a stochastic process the entire way right slightly moving down with some up months in between um and then if you go look at unemployment level it's been slowly Rising right it's been slowly Rising but this last month it was it was relatively steady but again if you were to take like say like a three-month moving average it has been slowly going up and then the last couple of months it's been declining a little bit which is one of the reasons why when you go look at the the job openings per unemployment per per unemployed worker you can see that while it was previously in a downtrend and it still probably is there's been a couple of months here where it's it's sort of slowly gone back up so by the March meeting which is on March 20th we'll have two more data points right we'll have we'll have two more data points we we'll see if this ratio is even lower if it's more in line with the 1.2 we'll see where the unemployment rate is if it's still at 37 or 38 or if it's marching North to 4% we'll get a lot more data between now and then but Powell is basically saying look unless the labor market really softens up which he was asked about he said you know someone asked if if there's a lot of issues in the labor market will that cause you to cut and he said you know certainly that would weigh a lot only you know two more data points in all these different categories right the unemployment rate um you know headline inflation core inflation all that stuff two more data points between non March they're not confident Pal's not confident that those two data points will be sufficient for them to argue that we're going to get a cut and if you think about it if they're going if they've written out three Cuts this year if they've written out three cuts um they probably wouldn't want to front load them because if you do the more you front load them early in the year the less you have later on to potentially cut in case things really start to get bad right like and also if they cut too soon think about how bad optically it would be if they cut 25 basis points and then and then waited for three months and then inflation went back back to like you know 4 or 5% like think about how opt how bad that would be if they just cut 25 basis points and then a couple months later they just had to raise it right back up you know markets would not like that business owners would not like that they really want to avoid a situation like the 70s and and this is this is what they they've done and it's kind of funny because I I think that they've advertised pretty well they've you know there's been a couple of flukes here and there they've advertised pretty well exactly what they're going to do and it seems like the market just hasn't believed them just like you know they've advertised three rate Cuts this year but the market thinks there's going to be six if you go back and look actually at at um the sort of the last business cycle what's interesting is that you know in 2019 they cut I I believe it was sorry this is not working um I believe it was three times was it three times so you have one cut so it went from uh 2.5% to 2.25 right they held steady and then they got two more Cuts in in 2019 right so they cut in July in September and October July September and October and now this cycle they've basically taken March off the table right basically taken March off the table so that means the earliest cut if if that's true is all the way out in May which would then put the sort of the pause at 10 months and again remember the median is eight that would put it at 10 months so if they do cut in May and they only want to cut three times if they cut in May then that means two more cuts at the next at the five meetings after that so maybe they would cut in May and then again in July and then again in November to spread it out um but again there's no guarantee they cut in May right and what if what if the the labor market still proves resilient even even that far out I I don't know you know I mean May you're going to have February March April um labor market data you you probably won't have all the May data because the the meetings actually on May 1 um but certainly I mean certainly a lot to think about here and how the fed's going to navigate this and again I know as an investor you're like how does this matter to me it all goes back to what assets outperform the most during QT and during rate hiking cycles and and you know times when the FED has has PA rates there there's one way to think about this right like look at Bitcoin I'm going to talk about it look at Bitcoin and I want I want to Overlay ether Bitcoin what do you notice about about ether Bitcoin and and and Bitcoin uptrends right there's two distinct types there's two distinct types and you can see them clear as day right I mean you know you have this uptrend here by Bitcoin where eth Bitcoin went down but that was also during a period of tight monetary policy right tight monetary policy during a you know during a pause and and and higher interest rates right Bitcoin went up in the face of it but the ether Bitcoin valuation went down right the eth Bitcoin valuation went down then you had a Bitcoin uptrend when e Bitcoin went up that was during QE and looser monetary policy right when we went back to looser monetary policy same thing over here right we're at H you know tight monetary policy Bitcoin has gone up but ether bit eth Bitcoin has gone down right so this this move here I think still resembles this one over here where Bitcoin has been in this uptrend just like it was over here but ether Bitcoin eth Bitcoin went down during that period because why why because high risk assets higher risk assets bled to lower risk assets now you know one of the questions that pal was asked was have we achieved a soft Landing what that really means if you're not you know I mean what it means to me and and pal said that they've not achieved it yet right they it's too soon to to celebrate if you think about what that would mean a soft Landing is essentially where they get inflation durably back to Target without pushing the economy into a recession right that was what that's what a soft Landing would be a hard Landing would be that they wait too long to cut rates and then the market just sells off right the market just sells off and then all of the assets that were doing well right like the Jugger nuts right like the apple and Nvidia and Microsoft all that stuff and and and even Bitcoin right in a soft Landing that stuff well it it might go down right I mean you can can get normal correction it doesn't necessarily have to get a a drastic correction like you know like like this type of a correction like a hard Landing type correction but a hard Landing type correction is where the the Le the the least risky stuff right that the the the companies that people put their money in those companies finally sell off and if those companies sell off then even the lower market cap stuff keep selling off even though they've already been smashed down so much much but then on the other side of that you go back to looser monetary policy and that's where the higher risk stuff starts to outperform the lower risk stuff and so I think that's kind of we're still in this transitionary period where you know and again I mean the eth Bitcoin chart is one example but you could take a you could take a look at the the Russell 2000 divided by I mean even the NASDAQ I look at it's the same it's the same thing guys right it's the same thing I mean look at the Russell 2000 the the rty NASDAQ valuation it's been going down because higher risk small market cap companies are bleeding to a lot of these Mega cap tech stocks how do you go back to a period where the lower the higher risk stuff the lower market cap companies start to outperform the NASDAQ what happened over here where it turned around we went back to looser monetary policy and that's where those lower market cap stuff started to outperform the higher market cap stuff so that is where you know that's where we are we've talked about this a lot and that's why I think it's worth it's worthwhile to follow this as an investor because monetary policy it it sort of dictates what assets you know do better right which ones tend to outperform and the reason those outperform is because you know and and going back to crypto right I mean people are pretty confident that Bitcoin will be here in five or 10 years no matter what happens in the next year can you say the same thing about any random altcoin no probably not right I mean you know if if if monetary policy were to stay tight for too long then some of those would just die off a lot of them would just die off because people would you know move on to something else whereas you know Bitcoin will stick around right you know no matter what happens more more than likely it'll still be here in a few years just like apple will be here and Google that's why people will focus on those things during you know during rate hiking Cycles during QT and that's why you hear things like the Magnificent 7 um it's exactly because of that it's because people Focus their capital on the companies that have you know a far greater chance to survive whatever is going to come on on the other side of rate Cuts but I think we'll wrap it up there I know we we've gone on a lot about where we are maybe there's one last thing um one interesting thing is like yields the long of the yo curve actually dropped quite a bit today um uh the 10year dropped 3% which is a pretty big drop for the 10-e and you can see it was actually rejected off of the 21 we EMA and so this is that whole idea of you know perhaps this is is the market saying oh crap they're not cutting that means you know perhaps this is the way the Market's telling telling us that you know by the fact that they've taken the March rate cut potentially off the table means that the Market's starting to worry more about well will the will some of this lower market cap stuff survive and perhaps the risk now is not inflation but whether you really start to slow the economy down because if the tenure is falling then it implies that inflation's not going to be as big of a deal if the market thought inflation was going to be a big deal then the tenure would be going up because it would imply that we're going to have um you know there's going to be a lot of growth and and re acceleration and all that stuff but if it's falling it implies that in the future you know there there's not going to be as much growth if there were then you wouldn't expect the long theal Cur fall it's it's the same thing like when you think about prior business Cycles right like look at at prior business Cycles you can see that you know the tenure goes up right the tenure goes up for a while and then at some point it it it falls back down as expectations change right as we as we chase the next narrative right over here the tenure went up and then in 2018 it started to go down as the market feared more so you know is there going to be as much growth um um so why don't we wrap it up there we' we've talked about quite a bit I I think I've gone on long enough thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up

analysis of the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates and inflation, warning that the central bank is likely to maintain a restrictive policy for an extended period to ensure the durability of its inflation-fighting efforts.The speaker argues that the Fed is hesitant to cut rates too soon, fearing a resurgence of inflation similar to the 1970s. They highlight the Fed's concern about reducing policy restraint too quickly, which could lead to a reversal of progress made on inflation. The speaker suggests that the Fed is likely to hold rates at the current terminal rate of 5.5% for an extended period to ensure inflation is durably brought back to the 2% target.The video also discusses the implications for investors, noting that higher-risk, smaller-cap assets tend to underperform during periods of tight monetary policy, while larger, cash-rich companies are better positioned to weather the environment. The speaker provides historical examples of how premature rate cuts in the 1970s led to a resurgence of inflation, emphasizing the Fed's desire to avoid a similar outcome.The overall sentiment of the video is bearish, as the speaker cautions against expectations of an imminent rate cut and highlights the potential challenges facing riskier assets in the current macroeconomic environment.One-line

Hi, today we're going to talk about market cap hypotheticals for various cryptocurrencies if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse tocom I do mention into the cryptoverse decom into the cryptoverse premium quite a bit uh but I do want you to be aware that there is a free tier in fact and on that free tier is the DCA simulation tool um and we've also recently added this tool so if you like what you see in the video and you would like to explore what I'm doing but for say um an asset that you hold then you can do that okay you can do that and it and it doesn't cost anything you can just go to the website and sign up I think having some tools available for free uh is is great because it can help people better understand market dynamics it can better understand help people understand you know various strategies that they should they should focus on now this is bit a bit more of of of a fun video someone someone suggested yesterday that I should make some more fun videos occasionally um and I I understand that my my content can get pretty repetitive I know the Bitcoin dominance views are repetitive like you know Bitcoin will basically chop up chop up the altcoin market until the dominance is is much higher and unfortunately I can't speed things along right like those are my views and I don't think those views are going to change until we're on the other side of of rate cuts which probably are going to come within the next few months so at least we have that to look forward to which is nice but in the meantime I I wanted to at least show this chart basically what it is is it's just saying if this cryptocurrency had the market cap of another cryptocurrency what would the price be right what would the price be I think a lot of people have thought about that before you know like if if altcoin a had the market cap of altcoin B then where would the price be and so what this video allows you to do or sorry not what the chart allows you to do is it allows you to select an asset right and going through the first several hundred right maybe a couple hundred almost couple hundred cryptocurrencies now I don't know 99.9 I mean I don't I probably don't even know what like 95% of those cryptocurrencies are or even do that's just where they're located by market cap so the default asset is Bitcoin but this one might not it might not make the most sense to spend a lot of time looking at because if you're daydreaming about Bitcoin going to you know to a higher price then you're probably not looking at it compared to other assets because it's number one by market cap okay but it does show you like if Bitcoin had the market cap of other cryptocurrencies where would the price be so like if Bitcoin had the market cap of eth then the price of Bitcoin would be at like 14k but I don't really think a lot of people are are interested in that aspect of this chart you could go to ethereum and see what would the price of ethereum be if it had the market cap of Bitcoin and the hypothetical price would be 6.83k now one thing I will remind you is that even if ethereum ever went to the market cap of Bitcoin today which I think it probably would eventually note that bitcoin's market cap would likely be higher if ethereum's market cap is where Bitcoin is today I don't believe that ethereum is going to flip Bitcoin at least not in the in the near future right I know a lot of people are are very um Pro that but you you think about ethereum it it has been putting in higher lows against Bitcoin since you know basically since it's been around macro higher lows when you think about it but this also been putting in lower highs since 2017 and so if it were to ever do something like that which I'm really skeptical of but if it were then I I I I would imagine it would be you know many many years away for something like that to happen so if a the were ever at the market cap of Bitcoin in my mind it would imply that bitcoin's market cap is actually quite a bit larger but I I think where this gets more interesting is if you go down the list right and and you you really go down the list and look at various cryptocurrencies and and kind of see where they fit in for instance like if we were to go down to say salana it'll show you where you know I mean it'll show you basically what the price would be if it had the market cap of various assets so essentially it shows you the latest price and so you know if salana had the market cap of xrp then the price of salana would be $65 therefore it implies that the market cap of salana is greater than xrp if salana had the market cap of BNB then it would be $107 if I had the market cap of Ethan it' be $631 if it had the market cap of madic it would be $16 if you were to look at xrp right you can go through the same type of exercise um cardano right same type of exercise like if it if Ada had the market cap of of avalanche then it'd be at 34 cents but if it had the market cap of xrp then it would be at 81 cents so we know that ADA then comes right in between here xrp and Avalanche and again I mean you can you can go all the way up the list right like if a had the market cap of salana then it'd be a buck 15 if it had the market cap of B&B than it' be 133 just to provide maybe one more example a couple more examples maybe Avalanche right like so if Avalanche had the had the market cap of ADA then it would put it at $46 if it had the market cap of B&B then it' put it at $126 if it had the market cap of Litecoin then it'd put it all the way down at $13 so I think a lot of us get so focused on on sort of the price and and what is price doing um but it's important to remember that like when you put out a price prediction if your price prediction for that asset is much higher than bitcoin's current you know if if the price suggests a market cap of that cryptocurrency that is orders of you know that's multiples above bitcoin's current market cap then it's likely not going to happen right it's like back in early 2021 when a lot of people were were calling for you know cardano for Ada to go to $50 and it's like guys like that's that's not going to happen that would imply it going to higher much higher than bitcoin's market cap and you know it's like I I know that you guys are bullish but I mean you also have to be grounded in your expectations you know there's there's all sorts of predictions out there that they sort of come out to play even even Bitcoin you know there were all sorts of predictions of calling for 300K back in the last cycle I'm sure a lot of people remember all those 300K predictions that were you know everywhere in early 2021 and then what happened right what happened to all those predictions they were wrong and Bitcoin didn't even go anywhere near 300K and the reason that you know I suspected that it wouldn't go there was because of the idea of diminishing returns right from one cycle to another to go to 300K that cycle would have implied that it had the same Roi in the last cycle as it did the cycle before and that hasn't happened before not saying it can't ever happen but that was the reasoning behind thinking it wouldn't go to 300K was because it would imply the returns for two cycles in a row would be the same that doesn't really make sense when the market cap was so much higher and we know it just takes you know exponen exponentially more money to move the asset if you look at at at polka dot you know the the current price of polka dot is is 670 if it had the market cap of of ADA then the market cap would be about $13 so I mean it shows you that A's market cap is about twice that of polka dots and it shows you you know which which assets have been stronger over the last few years right like if it had the market cap of xrp it'd be $21 if it had the market cap of BNB it'd be $35 if it had the market cap of ethereum it'd be $26 right it shows you where the where the price would be if it had the market cap of this other cryptocurrency so when you think about about things like price and like if something looks cheaper to you just because it's like a smaller value it's more important to look at at the market cap right like it doesn't make sense to go say Hey you know you know this cryptocurrency has a lower price than another cryptocurrency therefore it's going to catch up no I mean you should look at market cap now I know a lot of people will go out and say well you know there's going to be some people that will buy the asset just because it it has a lower price but I mean while there may be some elements of that that are true I I I still think in the end market cap is much more important and market cap will give us a better guide as to as to whether that is theoretically possible now remember it also depends on where bitcoin's market cap is so if you're at a position where you think that Bitcoin has topped out right let's say at some point you think all right Bitcoin is topped out and and my altcoin is going to run for a few weeks before everything comes you know crumbling back down right like let's imagine this scenario in the future if bitcoin's market cap is at a certain level and you don't think it's going to go any higher but you think your altcoin is going to go to a price that would mean 5x of bitcoin's current market cap then you know that's an outrageous prediction right and you know that if you hold out for such a price you will likely end up holding those bags for a long time and then hoping that the altcoin eventually returns to to new alltime highs most of the time a lot of altcoins don't there are some altcoins that do I know a lot of altcoins have had sizable rallies over the last few months and congratulations to those who have who have made gains on them but how many of them have put in new highs how many of them are anywhere remotely close to their prior highs right I mean bitcoin's kind of close um all things considered like it's not I mean it's in the' 40s and the high was at 69k but a lot of altcoins are still down you know 60% or more and unfortunately a lot of altcoins will they'll stay like that right there will be some that that likely reclaim their their all-time highs and there will likely be a lot of new altcoins that end up being the focus of of you know of of future Cycles but this is one tool that I think can be helpful for people um to navigate the market right and and and maybe just to provide a couple more examples uh here's chain link so if chain link had the market cap of ADA then chain Link's market cap or chain Link's price would be at $30 if it had the market cap of of salana then it would be at $71 and if Cosmos if Adam had the market cap of avalanche it would put it at $31 if it had the market cap of salana it would put it $15 if it had the market cap of Litecoin it would put it at $13 so this is a tool that just lets your imagination run for a little bit right to think about like what is possible right you know if you think about like an altcoin and and you're you know you're you're comparing it let's say it's like number 15 or 16 by market cap and you want to know is it possible for this you know for this asset to go to this price maybe just go look at some of the other altcoins that you think are you know relevant competition and if those assets have market caps that correspond to that price you're wanting then maybe it's possible but if the market cap of that that corresponding price corresponds to you know to bitcoin's market cap right then it's not it's likely not happening because as as much as you want your altcoin to be a competitor to bitcoin it's not it's just not and the truth is it likely never will be that's just the way the market works you know Bitcoin has been number one the entire time and yeah I mean I get people are going to say well you know what if it's the you know sort of the the AOL of the internet right like what if it's it's like the the Myspace of of social media I mean you can make those comparisons if you want to but I don't think this falls into that into that comparison a lot of those other things only were at the top for a few years I mean Bitcoin has been at the top since 2009 I mean you're you're talking about 15 years right at what point at what point do we just say hey it's it's it's unlikely that your altcoin is going to flip Bitcoin right and and again like it that seems like the the the the most logical conclusion to come to right like it's unlikely that's going to happen therefore if you're daydreaming about a price that you want your altcoin to go to look at bitcoin's market cap and say hey if bitcoin's market cap is there then probably not going to make it there right and in reality you know it probably won't even make it to you know to half of bitcoin's market cap right you know some have gotten close at various points um especially ethereum but um that's sort of the reality of of the situation is that you know most of them aren't going to go to like 80 90% of bitcoin's market cap even that and and they'd be lucky to get to 50% right I mean ethereum has has reached that Milestone and I think a few other altcoins have various points as well but it's just something to keep in mind so again this tool it's free right it's free and you can access it via into the Crypt premium link is in the description below just sign up for the free tier you just have to provide your email and then you can daydream about all the different cryptocurrencies you want to and what the price of those assets would be if they had the market cap of another cryptocurrency if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-01-26 00:00:00,"The video discusses a tool that allows users to hypothetically calculate the price of various cryptocurrencies if they had the market capitalization of other cryptocurrencies. The host explains that this can provide perspective on the realistic potential of an altcoin's price, as prices that would imply a market cap significantly higher than Bitcoin's are likely unrealistic. The host cautions against overly bullish price predictions, noting that many altcoins have struggled to reclaim previous all-time highs. The overall sentiment is cautious, emphasizing the importance of grounding price expectations in realistic market cap comparisons rather than unbounded optimism. The main message is that this tool can help cryptocurrency investors better understand the market dynamics and realistic price potential of different assets by comparing hypothetical market caps, rather than relying solely on price predictions that may be disconnected from fundamental market realities.",158,"[-0.02468872, 0.009963989, 0.0104904175, 0.036376953, 0.0061187744, -0.0010604858,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin dubious speculation if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom let's go ahead and jump in I can already tell that this will be a longer video and the reason for that is because I mean I certainly have a lot of different thoughts about the current situation in the market and how it relates you know how Bitcoin relates to to to The Ether Bitcoin pair and how that relates to bitcoin dominance and how all of it relates to alt Bitcoin valuations and how that relates to say like the stock market and the macroverse there's so many things to think about and it's it's really complicated you know to try to put it all together into a a cohesive argu arent that makes sense that you can stand back and say all right these are are the most likely outcomes for the next few months and let's see how it unfolds one of the reasons why I think there's so much tension in the cryptoverse right now is because there's there's two very different competing views on the market there's one side of things that simply suggests that that bitcoin price action follows the having Cycles uh by the way it's having it's not happing and the second of which implies that bitcoin price action more closely follows sort of macro business Cycles right you know going from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening and really up until this point they've they've all seemed to align and there's actually still a chance that they could align this cycle really depends on on how the next few months play out so what I want to do in this video is just go through a couple of different scenarios I don't really think we need to go through through too many but to go through a couple of different scenarios now before we get too much further I will say I I I cannot predict this the short-term price action like I don't know what's going to happen um i' I've said before a lot of times in the short term it's more or less a random walk and and it's it's really it's next to impossible to predict and in a video such as this one to express sort of both sides of of the views it it's going to make people uncomfortable right because the the bullish view would make people concerned about sort of the macro side of things uncomfortable but the bearish view would make make people that are more concerned about just sort of Bitcoin repeating what it's always done a little bit more uncomfortable so what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how both sides can come up with evidence to support their view um and you know I'll talk about you know My Views as well but that's what I I I would like to do in the video the first thing to sort of acknowledge here is that Bitcoin has had a pretty sharp selloff following the spot ETF okay so we had this spot ETF launch Bitcoin rallied all the way up to you know about 49k or so and since then it's had a pretty sharp drop uh but the grand scheme of things it the drop at this point is not that dissimilar from what we've previously seen in fact if you were to take a price range here you can see that we've dropped about 21% interestingly enough these prior drops were also about you know 20 21% 22% in that ballpark right so at this point I I don't really think anyone can say that this drop has been out of the ordinary right I think that'd be a fair assessment to say look guys this is still within the realm of what we've seen this cycle and and to suggest otherwise would be somewhat premature we know too that after Bitcoin has dropped below the 50-day moving average on more than one occasion you'll see that it tends to drop another 14 15% after going below that 50-day SMA right 14 15% drop here so far it's dropped about 10 11% 10 to 11% so yeah like in that regard it would lead you to believe that it it certainly could drop further especially considering that it has not yet reached the bull market Market support band okay but again there's no guarantee that we test it and if we do test it it could still be several months away right like it might not be this week it certainly could be but even in in Prior cases it took a while to sort of slowly bleed back down to it and in this case over here we just had a single Wick down to it and then that was it and we were right back up right really like the following day um but that is certainly something that I I think is worth keeping in mind is that look there's no guarantee that we go down to it immediately and even if we do we could get we could get a sharp bounce off of it and that's why I've said before the reaction is going to be very very important okay and one way to maybe illustrate that is to look at the market like this there's been a couple of times where we sort of dipped below the bull market support band like right here in late or sorry mid 2021 we then got back above it came back down to retest it and then got another pushup kind of a similar thing here right we were we were below it we got above it we came back down to test that bull market support band just a wick kind of like that one there and then we got a final push up so you can see this pattern has emerged a couple of times and so you know looking at the market today we have this move here where we've gone below it and clearly this is a significant level right like 48 49k is a significant level that doesn't mean that we can't take it out but what I'm what I'm saying is that I I think at the very least it's similar to a move like this where it it does Mark at least a local High um for a a you know some time right where it's going to take more than just a day or two to get back above it and so this is why I say you know looking here and here the reaction around this Zone I think is going to be incredibly important you know does it get something like this where it then pops up to take out this high now I mentioned that you can find evidence to support either View right because on one hand looking at at these patterns right here would certainly be evidence to support that view you could also look at competing evidence on say Bitcoin USD back in 2019 and see that these long Wicks over here this long Wick that occurred in June was never over taken right so there's no guarantee that we can even take out that prior High even if we do get a bounce in fact in 2019 when we when the bounce finally came we didn't we it just kept being sort of shorter and shorter Wicks look at monthly candles for Bitcoin USD back then right so going and looking at 2019 you see those monthly candles right we had one long Wick and then they just kept getting further and further down after that so I I I certainly am not suggesting that there's any guarant that we can take out that high what I am pointing out Simply is that there's two different patterns that we've seen one of which we saw Bitcoin top out just like here and then it didn't go any further but if you look at 2019 you will see that we put in this High here on some type of major product launched to the the cryptoverse and then following that we actually did sweep that high eventually right so there's no guarantee that that something like that can't happen again I've I've clearly noticed that the market has has very much been you know chasing one narrative to another you know whether it's the spot ETF whether it was the merge it seems like right after the Bitcoin ETF launched um people started to immediately shift gears to the ethereum ETF which you know I I don't know if it's going to be approved or not but it certainly seems like we're just sort of chasing one narrative after another and the the the two most compelling narratives for the first half of the year are the Bitcoin having and potentially an eth spot ETF right potentially but that's no guarantee right I said before I I think it's much more likely that that the Bitcoin one gets approved over ethereum because I think it's a little bit more clear that Bitcoin is a commodity whereas while I think it would be nice if if ethereum ether would just be declared a commodity I don't know if it's going to be that simple I mean they might push back on that for some time and therefore an ethereum ETF might not be approved for you know a lot longer than than people are initially hoping for okay so I think it's fair to say that we could Envision both potential outcomes here right one outcome being where you get some type of bounce off the bull market support ban and then the question is does it take out this high or does it not okay so again over here we took it out even over here we took it out over here we did not and so there's no you know there's nothing I can point to to say definitively what's going to happen because you're going to be able to find evidence to to suggest the contrary one of the things that I I think is interesting is is how all of this relates to the dominance of Bitcoin and I know a lot of people give me crap for it that's okay but what I will say is that you know the views on dominance have been I think I think they've been in line with what we've discussed I mean we never suggested that it would go up in a straight line um it's a long and grueling process where altcoins basically just get shaken out they get rined on their Bitcoin valuations and you know for the entire time people keep thinking that they're holding up well on their Bitcoin valuations how many times this year has someone told you that you know that ether Bitcoin is holding up well right over the last basically since the merge how many times has someone said that oh well ether's holding up well okay fine but it still just kept putting in lower highs right like it the trend hasn't necessarily changed and so I I think that's important to acknowledge that yes like it's it's it's holding up better than it did last cycle but who's to say that this pattern that has emerged by Ether Bitcoin isn't the same pattern that's playing out this cycle namely where you you put in a low after putting in sort of this double Peak pattern right you put in a low and then after that you keep testing that low until eventually it breaks right eventually and sometimes it's taken longer than other times to Break um but this is what we're looking at right and so when I look at a chart like this I say well you know how how does it break down down does it have to doesn't have to it doesn't have to break down but how would it break down how would it one thing to remember and I've I've been clear about this for a long time is that ether Bitcoin has historically broken down on bitcoin rallies okay now that doesn't mean that it has to break down in a Bitcoin rally there are times in in sort of the intermediate parts of the trend where it's breaking down on on a Bitcoin dump and in fact right here you will see there is a a phase at nearly the same valuation that it is today where Bitcoin dumped and ether Bitcoin lost this support level right you can see pretty clearly Bitcoin dumped and then ether Bitcoin lost support and it came down so I'm not suggesting that it has to lose support on a rally but if you look at the two other examples where their Bitcoin loss support right here and right here they occurred on bitcoin rallies right now you might notice actually that when it lost support here it was actually on a rally to a slightly lower high the high on bitcoin USD came the week of June 24th but ether Bitcoin did not lose support until the week of of July 8th I believe I think a lot of people maybe Overlook that but you can pretty clearly see we know that this peak here was the actual High when you look at the Wicks but ether Bitcoin didn't break down until a the week of July 8th after Bitcoin USD had part had already put in its high it was about two weeks later okay so that's something I I I think that it's important to sort of remember um I think that when you think about where Bitcoin is right now there's certainly elements of this business cycle that have have been interesting to say the least compared to Prior business Cycles one thing to suggest I'm trying to provide evidence for both sides so that neither side feels like they you know they got shafted in some way right one thing to consider about where Bitcoin is now compared to 2019 is that if you were to Overlay the NASDAQ it was actually when the NASDAQ put in a new you know when it was putting in new highs that is actually where Bitcoin topped out right around the time that bit that that the NASDAQ was putting a new highs if you overlay that you can see that the NASDAQ had sort of a fake breakout and then it broke out and you kind of have to look over here and sort of see the same thing right like the NASDAQ had the same sort of false breakout but then Bitcoin topped after that on say the actual Breakout by the NASDAQ which by the way I mean it still actually came back below the prior highs to put in a higher low but it was the second breakout to new highs by the NASDAQ that sort of LED Bitcoin to the downside and I I wonder if the reason for that is because the Market's just constantly chasing new narratives right for a long time the Market's chasing the spot ETF and then the market changes and says oh well you know let's stop talking about the spot ETF let's now chase the NASDAQ and Techo and the AI narrative right so I I I I do think there's a lot of elements of that where people are just sort of chasing one narrative to another whether it's you know Bitcoin spot ETF whether it could turn into the Bitcoin having whether it's AI whatever it might be it just seems like we're chasing one narrative to another my concern for for Bitcoin is really what happens if and when the narrative changes from no longer thinking about the having and and and the spotf or ethereum and all that stuff what happens when it's June you know May or June and we're in the dog days of summer and all these narratives that people have been chasing forever there's not really another great narrative to Chase and and then the economy is is starting to slow down in line with historical time frames that it has taken the economy to slow down after yield curve inversion so that is you know that's something that I I I just constantly go back to of when is that going to be the narrative that takes hold the one thing to consider with Bitcoin as it relates to ethereum is that if Bitcoin were to bounce off the bull market support band it would likely take eth with it okay but the the key thing to watch is if that happens Bitcoin dominance should go up do you guys remember a few months ago where dominance got washed out for like two months straight which is essentially what just happened and then following that we just started a slow dominance uptrend for a while if you see something like that play out where where either dominance just keeps going up or whether it goes up maybe gets rejected and then goes up again if this starts playing out again then I think we we need to be aware that it could be playing out like the last cycle now you might not know what I mean well if you look at at the last cycle with dominance one of the things you'll note and i' I've pointed this out many many times is that Bitcoin stayed risk on until we achieved dominance of retracement a fib retracement to the 0. five okay so to Overlay Bitcoin USD could be helpful so here you can see that Bitcoin topped right there the week of June 24th and that is precisely when Bitcoin dominance retra red to the 05 retracement level to that level the 0.5 retracement for Bitcoin dominance this time is not 65% like it was last time the 0.5 retracement is 56% 56% so I don't know how it's going to play out but if it did play out it means bit Bitcoin continues to wash out these altcoins on sporadic Bitcoin rallies until we hit 56% dominance now that doesn't mean that the rally has to go to new highs or local highs like it it doesn't mean that it has to go to 50K or the low 50s but it could if it were to play out like it did last cycle so you know when we when we look at this chart 56% dominance that I think is the level where e Bitcoin durably breaks support on the weekly time frame at at 56% dominance so if sometime over the next half year we're looking at the dominance chart and it says 56% then that would imply to me that ether Bitcoin has durably broken down and what I mean by durably breaking down is I mean a weekly close below 049 a weekly close below it we have not yet had a weekly close below it and I've said before it's important to get a weekly close below that level so why do we care so much about this well remember the issue for ethereum is not whether Bitcoin goes up right the issue for ethereum is if Bitcoin goes up more aggressively than eth because if ether breaks down against Bitcoin history would suggest that sometime after that a large correction could occur it could already we could already be in one right we could already be in it the correction could already be here and everyone's maybe hoping for a bounce that never comes but when you look at ether USD what do you notice about it what do we notice about when ethereum finally took the plunge to the lower regression band as always it was after ether Bitcoin broke down not before it was after so if you look closely here you'll see that right here after ether Bitcoin broke down that's where ether USD took the plunge last cycle when ether Bitcoin broke down right here in June of 2019 that's where ether USD took the plunge to the lower regression band and so right what we're looking at here is well we're flirting with it right I mean like it it it looks kind of similar you know you have your your your initial low you got your initial low and then you you sort of flirt around these levels for a while but eventually I'm afraid it will break and if and when it breaks is that when ethereum get it's that larger correction it could be a severe correction not just a 20 to 30% correction in fact historical moves back down to the lower part of the aggression band have been about a 70% drop this was a 70% drop this over here was about a 70% drop not including the recession pandemic not including the the the blacks Swan I think some people say well you know was a black one it already had a 70% correction before that like I mean just assume that this doesn't even exist on the chart we still saw ethereum drop to the lower part of the regression Band After ether Bitcoin broke down and ether Bitcoin broke down on a Bitcoin rally so where is ethereum today well I mean a 70% correction from the current prices would basically put it at the lower part of the regression ban now that doesn't imply necessarily that this is where ethereum has to correct from it certainly could be the case you might say well isn't that a cheap way out for me it's not because for me all I really care about is The Ether Bitcoin pair as it relates to ethereum because I think ethereum breaks down against Bitcoin I don't have much interest in ethereum I can acknowledge that it's possible for ethereum to go higher on its USD pair but I I would also say the only way it does that is if Bitcoin gets an aggressive bounce off of say like the bull market support ban or the 100 we SMA that's the only way in my mind which could be flawed but that's the only way that I I would see ethereum getting another push higher would be that if Bitcoin gets that push back up first so yes like it's possible that ether could go higher um there's actually some similarities right between between this low here and then this low here right this is about a 10x move right because this low here was about you know in the 80s this low here was in the 800s this High here the weekly closed was about 300 and then it had a wick a few hundred higher than that and so you know we haven't we haven't hit 3K on eth there no guarantee that we do right but what I can say is that if it's going to happen it's probably going to happen in the next couple of months right because you know I mean you can see there was a pretty big correction over here by eth it dropped about 14% in a week and then it got that final move up and then it broke down but here's the thing I don't know if this move is going to occur frankly I don't care you know I and I've been clear for years that my crypto portfolio is just Bitcoin heavy because I basically expect almost everything else to break down against it over time until we get back you said it to looser monetary policy so what I'm looking for to get interested in ethereum is first I would would need to see ether break down against Bitcoin which my guess is it's still a few months away from doing that I would not mind it breaking down sooner I wouldn't mind it at all but there's a lot of history that shows that you know when we do get bounces by eth Bitcoin it takes a while to get back down to those lows right people don't just give up on it that easily they'll fight and with the spot ETF stuff for eth they'll fight a long time until it's just like the consumer the consumer will spend until they literally just cannot cannot spend anymore so people will fight as as hard as they can to keep this ratio up but in the end in the end I I still think it will fall it might not fall until March or May or June right I don't know here it fell in in in the month of July but it tested it you can see that it tested it in September and in December and in May and then it finally fell in July we said going into January that if we don't get a weekly close below this level early on in January then it's likely to get a bounce and the reason for that is because January does tend to offer favorable seasonality for ethereum right it does and so yes the same thing played out just like it usually does right the same the basically the same thing played out so when I look at at you know at at Bitcoin and I think like well is this the top for a while is this sort of the the midcycle top if you want to call it that it's possible but I will say if it is the midcycle top I have a feeling the market will give it another go just to see if it is right you know just to make sure so the market market participants might say well you know there's the having and and they're going to see one last time if that's the top or if they can if they can take that out in 2019 they were not able to take it out in 2021 they took out that long Wick right here they did not here they did here it went about you know 6% above 6% above that Wick would put you at around you know 52k or so so it's a dilemma right it's sort of a dilemma of well is that is that move going to come or not there's another way to sort of visualize this stuff and and um I I want to I want to continue to provide evidence on on sort of both sides of the argument and the reason I do it the reason I I I provide evidence for both sides is so that people can can can invest accordingly right so that people can say all right you know we've seen the arguments and based on on the risk this is how you want your portfolio to be right sort of an acknowledgement that we can't know the future but there's a certain risk that we go up there's a certain risk that we experience a terrible crash and how do you hedge against that sort of stuff right well for me you know the way I've done it as I've said is just I've kept my crypto portfolio Bitcoin heavy but I've also got some cash on the sidelines uh in case there is a larger drop I'm not going to apologize for that uh that's that's what makes sense for me one of the things I I think to to look at is at this point we are still still following historical Norms the year-to-date Roi of Bitcoin in 2024 is actually still mimicking 2016 right is it not it's still mimicking 2016 and you can see that in 2016 after about you know the fourth month or so Bitcoin had another large move to the upside if Bitcoin were to get another large move to the upside like it did LA in uh 2016 then I think this would probably be enough to break ether down against Bitcoin if it has not already broken down against Bitcoin so this is an important chart to look at you can see that in 2020 we had a a much larger drop in 2012 we also had a drop in all three cases in all three cases prior to this cycle we had a drop in q1 of the having year in all three and that's why I said going into the having year that you should be prepared for that right we had the drop here we had it right here and we also had it right here and now looks like we've more or less had it again it's a very common pattern for Bitcoin to get this drop to the bullmark sportband but as I said so far it's not different from these Corrections that we've already seen right it's not that different and we need to see the reaction at the bullmark sport band one thing that has not yet happened that I still think needs to happen is that alts need to break down against Bitcoin total three minus usdt to bitcoin has not yet broken down you can see that last cycle it took a while for it to break down in fact from when it set this first low right here it didn't durably break down for about 41 weeks 41 weeks after this low right there puts you in April which coincidentally is the month of the having which by the way is coincidentally the same the month before the First Rate cut if it doesn't come in March right now Market thinks First Rate cut comes in May so think about it it seems to be aligning to some degree you have altcoins still have not yet broken down against Bitcoin we know that last cycle they broke down in June of 2019 which was 1 month before the First Rate cut right it was one month before the First Rate cut one month before this First Rate cut potentially could be April which by the way is the having month which by the way is where we've historically seen another move by Bitcoin if the if it if it already hasn't had some type of massive capitulation like we got in March of 2020 so I still think alts need to break down against Bitcoin but they haven't broken down yet right they haven't but I think that is is something that will happen in the first half of this year I think all Bitcoin pairs will drop we need to see total 3 minus USD divided by Bitcoin go below 40% and get weekly closes below 40% just like I think ether Bitcoin needs to drop below 049 and get weekly closes below that right if you were to look at some of the other altcoins you know Ada is a good example Ada Bitcoin Ada Bitcoin had a big local top right there which I think kind of is similar to that one right you can kind of see similar moves here but you can see that after it had that move it it just faded back down and eventually it finally broke that low in June of 2019 one month before the First Rate cut again First Rate cut potentially coming in May maybe March it'd be interesting if it came in March because then everything gets fast forwarded potentially to now right but I think it's still going to break down so what if that is ultimately what happens that you know Bitcoin continues to chop around for let's call it three more months and during that time alt break down against Bitcoin you can see over here after after Bitcoin put in this local high in June we didn't even break down until September July August September it was three months three months of chopping around before Bitcoin finally broke below the bull market support ban 3 months 3 months from here guess where that puts you puts you in April that would be three months from now also if we do put in a new local high or we sweep the high kind of like we did over here if we do something like that history shows it would probably happen in in March or April right in in potentially March or April maybe May at the latest but I still think this Market has hasn't has been very uncanny in terms of rallying into narratives whether it was the merge the spot ETF um everything you can think of it's basically just done something like that but I think later this year the narratives are going to change from all of that stuff that people are worried about right now to oh crap how much damage should the Federal Reserve do and when that happens that's when I think ethereum finally gets that larger drop if you look you can see last cycle it actually played out in a very similar manner with with ether you had a low a higher low a higher low and on the fourth attempt it finally broke and that was where that larger drop came note that on the fourth attempt it broke after ether Bitcoin broke so what that would imply is that ether Bitcoin will break down first and then after ether Bitcoin breaks down ether USD will probably lose this trend line potentially you know sometime in the next few months or so right this is if it were to play out in a similar way so what I'm suggesting is that sometime in the next few months ether Bitcoin breaks down after ether Bitcoin breaks down ether USD breaks down one of the things about ether USD that you might notice is that it doesn't tend to just put in a low and then never test the Integrity of that low look at all the prior examples right you have a low you test the Integrity of it you have this low here you test the Integrity of it same thing same thing again so at some point I think we're I think ethereum will test the Integrity of that low back down below $1,000 um but history would also suggest that it won't test it until after ether Bitcoin breaks down and history also suggests that ether Bitcoin probably won't break down in January because normally January is a good month for ethereum and it could still take some time given these narratives that are floating around given the spyf for E given the the having narratives right it could take some time for that to play out but imagine ether USD or ether Bitcoin just you know sort of stays in this range and then eventually breaks down that when it breaks down assuming that it does that I think is when ether USD will break down right something like that which would take it as we've said before to the lower regression B the issue is I don't know what type of shenanigans are going to go on between now and may right like I don't know if it's I don't know if this move is already over and it's just going to sort of slowly bleed here and then go back down or if it'll get one more push higher like it did over here because what you might notice is that this move by Ether over here that initial move got it to 270 that's interesting isn't it because this move right here got it to 2700 but look the only way ether gets this move here right the only way in my mind that it gets that move is if Bitcoin gets a move back up and I don't think I don't think bitcoin's going to get that move back up until I mean I think I think we still need to have some time go by um we do have the the OMC the last day of the month so about a week from um or sorry yeah about I mean a a week from a little over a week from when I'm recording this video I don't know exactly when I'm going to get this video out but probably in the next day or two but January 31st so you know if if Bitcoin is going to get a bounce to test whether that's the high or not that's when it's probably going to happen right sometime February or March time frame and the hard part is I don't know if it's going to take out the high or not 2019 it did it or sorry in 2019 it did not but in 2021 it did there's other ways that we can look at this and and one of them is actually usdt dominance you're like oh well that's coming out of left field but take a look at at usdt dominance there's actually a a somewhat interesting Trend here on usdt dominance where essentially what has happened is that every time it tags this trend line it is marked a significant level a significant top look at these trend line look at the trend line where it tagged it June 2019 you guys know what happened in June 2019 that marked the top for Bitcoin right here June 2019 you remember what happened in February 2020 when we tagged this trend line February 2020 is right before Bitcoin collapsed what happened in May of 2021 right when we were tagging this trend line we were tagging it in March April and May that was when Bitcoin was putting in all these highs right here we were tagging that trend line the entire time and then look at it again November of 2021 we tagged the trend line and you guys know what happened in November that marked that top and so that's the question is is is usdt dominance going to get rejected here and come back down for one last move I mean in September it was at 8 and a half% dominance now it's at 6 and a half% dominance the trend line is at about 4% dominance so if usdt dominance were to go down to % that would probably be a huge warning signal to the market a huge warning signal at 4% dominance for usdt because anytime it's gotten that low you then get a rotation out of crypto or out of risk assets into the stable coins and you get a massive crash in crypto when that happens so I'm not saying that that crypto can't go down there's been plenty of times throughout this entire phase over here where Bitcoin had drops we also know that bit Bitcoin has had significant drops um you know at at other times right like it's not like it had to be at at a peak for it to have a significant drop I mean you know when it was here in April of 2022 it was just before it had a significant drop but it wasn't on the trend line so what I what I'm saying is if it comes down here right like if Bitcoin were to get a pop up after hitting the bullmark S band and if usct dominance were to go back down to the bottom of the trend line then to me it would suggest that there's a a crash that's about to ensue as they we've always we've always had crashes after we hit this trend line now you might say why does it have to play out like this why does it it doesn't we don't it we don't have to have a crash right like nothing has to happen it's just that ethereum tends to drop after the ethereum Bitcoin valuation breaks down that's what tends to happen and that just hasn't happened yet because people have been so so stubborn and they just keep you know going full Deen into the altcoin market but history shows us that dominance does not likely top until after rate Cuts arrive right dominance did not top here until after rate Cuts arrived so why do I assume it has to be different what if this time's not different what if what if dominance does not top until after rate Cuts arrive let's suppose the First Rate Cuts in March you can see here we had a First Rate cut in July and then dominance TOS two months after that right so if if the First Rate let's say the First Rate Cuts in May so then June July so then July would potentially be two months after the First Rate cut but I I I still think that there's a case to be made that dominance is potentially sort of in this range right here and we're going to get a a large move to the upside relatively soon now there actually is one chart I could look at that is is a little bit scarier than the way than looking at it like this I mean if you look at it like this it looks like everything's fine and there's nothing to be concerned about which could be the case at this point we haven't had that big of a drop there's other ways to look at it which would suggest it could get a little bit a little bit more challenging um you know if you look at at like the the running one-year Roi you can see that it's it's been dropping a lot recently and and after it sort of hit these levels in the past we've had pretty big drops in fact once it hit this level last cycle in February 2020 that's what happened just before the crash another way to look at it is to look at the uh the ROI from the peak for Bitcoin sorry that's the wrong one and if you just look at this cycle compared to last cycle this is actually look at the green line that's this cycle the orange line that's the last cycle right around now is is where that big drop occurred right so it's this Market I feel like it's constantly keeping under toes and you can see how there's so much evidence to support either of you right like we could look at at at different pieces of evidence you might say well you know is there any is there any guarantee that the market or the the economy has to slow down there's no guarantee of anything okay um but I will say you know to ignore it might not be the wisest idea if you look at the yield curve it is still inverted it is still inverted if you look at at Treasure yield spreads the three Monon and the 10e the spread on this is um you know I mean still very much inverted and at some point I imagine it will become uninverted uh this year look at the 2-year and the 10year spread it's almost at un inversion already it's getting pretty close normally that signals weakness if and when that happens hasn't happened yet but it's getting pretty close if you were to look at say like the 10year treasury yield it's moving back up but I wonder if it's just going to get rejected up here if you were to take a look at the 2-year minus the 10-year you may notice that it just got rejected off the bullmark sport band which a lot of times when that has occurred during y curve inversion happens just before the uninversity but there's certainly a lot of different things to suggest that the economy is slowing down and I know I know the labor market has been relatively tight if you were to look at initial claims still relatively low I mean 187k that's not really recessionary territory you would expect it to be somewhere in the 300 range with that said I mean there's certainly things that you could look at um like highers and if you were to look at at say new highers and and take the inverse of that so 1 over M2 and then we're going to Overlay the unemployment rate you can see that you know I mean normally this one over highers sort of leads it right so if it's going up it's only a matter of time before the unemployment rate starts to go up and it's been going up up pretty aggressively right hes has been dropping Like a Rock So it seems like it's just a matter of time so my view on the market is this I I I just want to be clear my view on the market is this I think that over the next few months Bitcoin is going to chop the altcoin market up that's what I think that shouldn't be news to you that's been my view for two years is that that's what happening and people are give me a hard time about it but who can look at the Bitcoin dominance chart and say it was wrong right with a clear conscience who can look at the dominance chart and say that was the wrong view dominance has been going up for a long time despite people claiming it's not it has been so my view is that over the next few months Bitcoin chops the altcoin market up my view is that it's going to get certain types of bounces either off the bullmark sport band potentially the 100 we SMA there's all sorts of levels that you could look at right but we've been talking about these levels for a while you know 36k 37k that's where the bull Mark SP Bend is um you could even go back down to the high 30s and low 20s but at some point I think there will be a Bitcoin bounce on on its USD pair and when it bounces that's where I think alts finally break down on their Bitcoin P that's where I think ether breaks down on its Bitcoin pair when Bitcoin bounces regardless of whether it takes out the prior High I don't it doesn't matter to me right regardless so whether it bounces at the bullmark sport ban whether it bounces here whether it goes back down to this level um or whether it goes down to the the 100 we estimate which has historically been visited as well around this time of the of the cycle whatever it does right whatever it does all any any type of these scenarios when the bounce occurs if a bounce occurs I think I I think that is where alts break down against Bitcoin if there is no bounce if no bounce occurs if if everyone's waiting for this bounce that never actually happens because perhaps instead of getting a bounce we're just getting something like what happened last cycle where we just go into outright capitulation if that occurs instead I still think dominance will go up because when ether USD breaks this trend line I think it's basically just straight straight back down to the bottom part of the range right straight back down whenever that breaks so those are my views Bitcoin chops up the altcoin market for the next few months it could Bounce It could it could put in a slightly lower High um it could even take out the prior high if it wants to repeat 2021 but regardless of how high it goes ether Bitcoin breaks down as Bitcoin dominance hits 56% and we've explained why 56% is is an important level as Bitcoin dominance hits 56% that's that 0.5 retracement level that we've talked about right here and you can see that this sort of this Wick right here is the same type of thing is as as as these Wicks over here in the same band right between the 382 and the 0.5 this is between the 382 and the 0.5 same Wicks same levels I think eventually it's going to and you can see that it after hitting these Wicks it fell below the bull Mark sport band between the 236 and the3 382 that's where we are right now so when if and when this move comes that is where you have to be very very careful furthermore while Bitcoin USD struggled after after dominance hit 56% or after it hit the 0.5 Bitcoin dominance still went up to the 618 and I think controversial as I know that it is but I think that Bitcoin dominance can still go to the 618 which is 60% if you were to look at Bitcoin dominance plus usct dominance you can see that it's actually at the same level that it was at in May of 2019 just right before rate Cuts arrived right it's the same thing if you add in usdc dominance same thing right look at this it went down to it went all the way up to 64% and then it went all the way back down to 58 look at this 64 back down to 58 and then look now it's going up again just like it did over here and if it continues to go up then I'm arguing what if it just simply goes all the way back up to the top part of the range up here at 75% this is not Bitcoin dominance this is Bitcoin dominance plus usdc dominance plus USD dominance so you're accounting for there's other there's other assets that people are going to but I think Bitcoin dominance would also go up in such a move the dollar is really interesting right now because to me this looks exactly like the Bitcoin dominance chart when it was carving out these lows look at it it's almost identical to the Bitcoin dominance look a low high a lower low a lower high same thing with dollar a low and a high a lower low here and then a lower high and then a lower a third lower low same thing as Bitcoin dominance and then it took out that high right like it swept that high and went slightly higher just like the dollar just did over here right it took out these highs and swept it and went higher and then after all that Bitcoin dominance came back down put in a low went up to the bull Mark sport band got rejected the dollar is now at the bullmark sport band so if it were to continue to emulate the dollar or sorry Bitcoin dominance then it could come back down and then go up or it just goes straight up so for the dollar those are my two base cases right either it just goes straight through it and we forego that last move back down by the dollar or we get one larger pullback by the Dollar near these prior lows and then from there it goes up which funny enough if you look at the time frame on this low here to the next low it was about about 3 months or so here December right so if you were to go out let's say 11 weeks that put you in March March which is right around the time like it all seems to be kind of like no matter how you look at it it seems like a lot of things sort of line up around that March April May time frame you know where where dominance is probably going to break up um ether Bitcoin will probably break down you know sort of in that in that same time frame it might be a little bit later it could be you know June or something as rate Cuts arrive and then everyone shifts from talking about risk assets and and and and Spide ETFs and and all that stuff so then figuring out how much damage has the FED done and are they have they pushed us into a recession or not so those are my views on the market I I hope I've I've communicated them well I don't know if if this is the high for Bitcoin or not I I don't I I I think you can easily find reasons for it to be cons considering that we just launched another product from Wall Street and that tends to Mark tops it could certainly be one other way to to view this is that I mean this was also the coinbase IPO and then eventually we actually swept that high so there maybe a little bit of a counter counter evidence one thing that I've thought about and and this is going to get me into trouble but I I I do wonder if if ether Bitcoin is it all showing us what Bitcoin USD is going to do because you know ether Bitcoin put in a significant low and then it rallied all the way back up and what's interesting about that rally is that it actually rallied I mean it had a wick higher but it rallied to the 786 and then it still came all the way back down to the prior low if you were to go look at Bitcoin it's already hit the 618 how many times of the last year have we said that the 618 could be tagged if it just wants to emulate exactly what it did in 2019 right the 618 that's where I went in 2019 the 618 just before rate Cuts arrived that's that's more evidence to suggest that that's the top it tagged the 618 just like it tagged it here okay but if it were to emulate ether Bitcoin and it were to go up to say the the 786 which is even higher that I mean that would be an insane move right that would be an insane move that's not necessarily my base case to be completely honest but I've seen crazier things happen the point is I don't know whether you know whether this is it whether it bounces up one last time um whether it I don't know what it does if you actually look really closely at 2019 what you'll see is that it went to the 618 and then after going to the 618 it went back down to the 382 and then back up to the 05 and there was actually a wick in here in between um but it still went to the point 382 first so it was 618 then 382 then 0.5 618 was 48k it's already going past the 0.5 guess where the 382 is guess the 382 is exactly at the bullmark sport B right now so if this drops here in the next week or so it's hitting the 382 which is exactly where it hit it in 2019 after it came off of this high so if we hit the 382 and if we get a bounce 42k is going to be the big level that it has to get by 42k 42k is where it was rejected at back in August 2019 after it got a bounce so what I'm saying is that if we do get this bounce and we go back back up and we put in and we go to 42k if we cannot get past 42k then it strongly suggests that this is the local high for potentially a long time you know until we get back to QE if we can get past 42k then you're looking at at you know potentially coming back up and sweeping these highs or if it wanted to emulate ether Bitcoin going up to the 786 here's the crazy thing even though ether Bitcoin went to the 786 it still bled back down and put in a new low it's still bled back down put in a new low if you look at Bitcoin one of the things we've said before is the regression rainbow the two and a half log line rule it's already been hit I don't see why we have to hit it again two and a half log lines down one two two and a half right half one two two and a half log lines again where does it put it 1 two2 middle of the green line that's exactly where we peaked out last cycle middle of the green band two and a half from there half one2 it's the line that we just tagged right so we just tagged that line that line right now by the way is at 49.4k but when we tagged it I mean it's kind of crazy like when we tagged that line you can see that we basically hit the regression band right right here it came within just a what a couple hundred dollars we we went to basically 40 48975 the regression band was at 49.2k I mean it was literally right there so if we bounce this would you know by by March or April it would correspond to like 52 right if we don't bounce then 29k is what's going to come into play it's a you know it's a it's a really difficult market and I I don't have the answers I don't claim to have all the answers I hope that I've been helpful to people I don't always get the sense that I am but I I do hope that has been somewhat helpful if you want to know like how I navigate this Market amidst all this uncertainty I do the same thing that I've been doing and saying forever I DCA in at a low enough risk level if the risk level is low enough then I'll buy if it's too high then I sell some that's all I do right I don't I don't concern myself with the ETF stuff or the merge or whatever the newest narrative that that crypto Twitter is trying to sell to you think about about how many people a couple of weeks ago were saying that there's no way it's a sell the news event and here we are Bitcoin dropped 15% right it was a sell the news event that doesn't mean that it can't eventually go higher but it was a sell the news event and just don't you know don't fall for those narratives because those narratives you know they they seem like they're so convincing when people are are are saying that it's it's up only and then few weeks pass you're like oh nope it was the same thing as it always was it was a sell the news event just like every other institutional product launched into the cryptoverse forever has marked local highs oh surprise surprise it did once again so the two and a half log line rule has been hit um if we were to tag it again which you can see kind of like over here in in February 2021 you can see that we would tag it and then we just kind of kept tagging it as we as we kept going up so there there's there's I could see something like that happening um where you know it it sort of seems like it just won't it won't give up but really it's just tagging the same trend line another way to look at this by the way is to let me get rid of the regression rainbow look at it like this right you can see that Bitcoin went back to this level the same thing in 2019 you see that same thing same thing so the the most compelling view for me if if there is a Bitcoin bounce the most compelling view for a bounce would just simply be alts still need to break down against Bitcoin and if they haven't broken down against Bitcoin yet then it just means there's liquidity that needs to get washed out it needs to get rinsed out and after that liquidity gets rinsed out then we can get a larger drop the question is is does it get rinsed out just by Bitcoin chopping around for three months like it did 2019 or does it get rinsed out by Bitcoin going back up and sweeping the high like it did in 2021 I don't know I think there's a case to be made either way I think that no matter what happens Bitcoin dominance is going to go up and even if Bitcoin were to crash even if that happens even if it were to drop like it did over here 72% from the midcycle top 72% drop would even put Bitcoin at a new low right even if it did that which everyone on crypto Twitter is going to say it can't happen but even if it did I still think Bitcoin would eventually recover right so that's why I still have you know that's why I still have Bitcoin even though I acknowledge it could it could drop a lot but I I have it because even in the case that it drops I think the FED will pivot we will go back to loer monetary policy and then Bitcoin will rise again so this is this year right here I think at some point we'll probably revisit this range was my guess because at some point we need to get the inversion of the yield curve at some point the fed's going to Pivot and normally that's not a good thing for risk assets especially crypto especially coming out of yield curve inversion I think some people say well you know risk assets do well once the FED starts cutting that's true as long as there's not a recession so the I think the main issue this time is that we have an inverted yield curve sometimes the fed's raising rates but we don't have an inverted yield curve right we have an inverted yield curve right now because policy was just not nowhere near where it needed to be for so long um and I I I think the yield curve is telling us that something you know the economy is sick and the fed's trying to do what they need to do to to get inflation to go away but hasn't gone away yet so I I think at some point we're going to come back in here and and visit this range um this is sort of the sort of the window of I don't know how high it's going to go before we get that sort of that riskof event where ether uh goes back home as I've said and in ether Bitcoin breaks down and and then the other thing to look at are some of these altcoins like if you were to look at at at total three if Bitcoin were to get a bounce you know it would it would certainly drag Alt with it on their USD pairs I just think they would break down on their Bitcoin pairs I mean even even even Ada which has been relatively weak uh for a while I mean you can see that it did bounce off the bull Mark sportband in May of 2019 you know two months before the First Rate cut but at a Bitcoin coin had already topped out in April right so in in in May and June when ad USD was getting a balance it was only getting a Balan because Bitcoin was going up it wasn't getting a balance because because it was just you know fundamentally strong at the time it was just getting bced because Bitcoin was going up and it didn't bottom until way down here after rate Cuts arrived and it broke down against Bitcoin which happened during a Bitcoin rally so a lot of stuff to think about I will try to provide an update to this video based on what happens over the next few weeks the thing I will be looking at will be is there a bounce here if there's not a bounce there your next bet for a bounce is probably going to be in the low 30s and if not there then your next bet is going to be at 28k which is where the 100 we SMA is if we W if we just follow this and we're sitting on the door of capitulation right now then you know I would I would be interested again in in alt coins if something like that were to happen but until until dominance goes higher until all Bitcoin pairs break down it's hard for me to get interested and so that's where I stand on the market hopefully I've communicated it effectively I don't expect to get everything right in fact probably most of what I said will not actually pan out in the way that I said um but I I just want people to be aware of like you know what I'm looking for to to sort of signal that altcoins are are durably gaining against Bitcoin I don't even know I mean some people tell me that that alts have been really strong against Bitcoin but you look at total three minus USD to about Bitcoin I'm like where right I mean you know are you just are you just looking at at the last few months and saying oh well hey a few months for at least a few months alts have slowed the bleeding yeah so what they did over here too and they still broke down they still broke down and even if you include eth even if you include eth but if they still break down you know so that's what we're looking at that's what I'm looking at hopefully it Mak sense we covered Bitcoin we covered ethereum we covered altcoins we covered the fed and lowering you know loosening monetary policy we looked at the treasury yield curve we looked at a lot of stuff um one last thing total market cap it's been in this trend line this channel for a long time look at these top top top bottom bottom this was the midcycle top of 2019 we've come pretty close to that trend line we haven't actually tagged it yet I don't know if we're going to tag it but you can see we tagged it right there in Q3 of the of the bare Market year and then we tagged it again just before rate Cuts here we tagged it in Q3 of the bare Market year I'm wondering if we tag it again just before rate Cuts we already come we already came pretty close and honestly I could I could shift this a little bit to show it already tagging it right and it doesn't really look like anything changed um but if we do tag it I wonder if if we still have to t you know tag the bottom of this channel which by the way the bottom of this Channel right now is still below the prior lows in terms of total market cap it's at Bel less than 600 billion it's going to take until August or it's going to take until September for this channel to reach these lows that we set back in in um in 2022 it'll take until September so you could always get either an example where it you know it just goes straight back down or it pops up and then comes back down and then and then continues on or maybe it pops up and then goes all the way down and then and then continues on I don't know those are my views hopefully you guys appreciate them even though I know they're not perfect I think we'll wrap it up thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium

two and its implications for the broader crypto market. The speaker presents evidence for both bullish and bearish scenarios, acknowledging the difficulty in predicting short-term price movements.Key points:
- Bitcoin's recent 21% drop from $49k is within the normal range of corrections seen this cycle, but further downside to the bull market support band around $48-49k is possible. The reaction around this support band will be crucial, as past patterns show it can mark a local high before another push up or a breakdown.
- Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) is a major concern, as a breakdown in this pair could lead to a larger correction in Ethereum's USD valuation, potentially around 70%. Bitcoin dominance reaching the 56% 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level could signal a durable breakdown in ETH/BTC, which has historically occurred during Bitcoin rallies.
- The speaker expects most altcoins to break down against Bitcoin until looser monetary policy returns, and maintains a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio stance. They suggest that over the next few months, Bitcoin will chop up the altcoin market as dominance rises.
- The speaker analyzes various indicators, such as the yield curve, treasury yield spreads, and unemployment data, which suggest the economy may be slowing down. This could lead to a shift in market narratives from risk assets and ETFs to concerns about the Federal Reserve's actions and potential recession.
- The speaker presents multiple scenarios for Bitcoin's price action, including the possibility of a bounce to the $52k level or a deeper drop to around $29k, depending on whether it can reclaim the $42k resistance level. They also draw parallels between Bitcoin's current cycle and the 2019 cycle, noting potential support around the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level.
- The speaker suggests that altcoins may need to undergo further rinsing out of liquidity, either through Bitcoin chopping around for months or by sweeping the highs, before a larger altcoin recovery can occur. They maintain a cautious stance, acknowledging the uncertainty in the market and the potential for further downside in the near-to-medium term.Overall, the sentiment is cautious, with the speaker acknowledging the uncertainty in the market and the potential for further downside in the near-to-medium term.",488,"[0.026153564, -0.0031318665, -0.019073486, -0.010169983, -0.00032615662,

Hi, today we're going to talk about stablecoin dominance and we're going to be using stablecoin dominance to get a glimpse into a metric that might help us better anticipate larger Corrections in the cryptoverse in the future if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse docomo which of course would be nice to avoid if you knew it was coming now of course it's impossible to know when those larger events are going to occur but there is something that we can potentially look at in the stable coin Market that might give us a glimpse into that and so I will be the first to tell you that all models are wrong some are useful I certainly wouldn't take a single model to the bank and ask them to cash it in what I am saying is that using this has been a pretty good predictor of larger drops in crypto and so we want to see where it is now and what that would mean for the future so this here is the usdt dominance right so it's the tether dominance and we can also add in usdc dominance and we we'll probably do that in a little bit but I want you to take a look at this chart now it's on a linear scale but and that's how I think we should observe it but I want you to just take a look at this chart and and what you will quickly notice is that there has been a clear trend of higher lows on the usdt dominance chart right in fact if you were to go back to 2018 and connect the dots what do you notice there has been clearly a series of higher lows but each of these higher lows that tagged this trend line was a huge warning signal to the cryptoverse when the trend line was tagged let me show you what I mean there's several different examples here this one and here even here we got pretty close that trend line tag right there this one and this one now we're going to go through each of these what's this one November of 2021 what is this one March of 2021 March April it was basically February March and April of 2021 but it basically left the trend line in May right so really I guess early May 2021 just before we had like a 50% drop in crypto okay so those are the first two examples what's the next example February of 2020 February 2020 it was right before the pandemic drop June of 2019 this one here November 2018 we'll get to that one in a minute this one here January 2018 okay so that is when this trend line has been tagged it's kind of an interesting thing all of these dates should mean something to you right they all should mean something to you if you've been in crypto I bet everyone knows the significance of November 2021 right that actually marked the top back at 69k for Bitcoin May of 2021 what happened then let's just overlay Bitcoin onto the chart so you guys can see it for yourselves let me make this a color that we can see a little bit easier line them up this uh tag of the trend line right here November 2021 corresponded that Peak this trend line when we left it corresponded to just before that drop February 2020 when we tagged it just before that drop June of 2019 just before this drop November of 2018 this is probably one that you might think well wait a second that was near the end of the bar Market of 2018 well it was but it also came just before a 50% drop so yes it was near the end of a bare Market but still we still had a lot further to fall January 2018 what do you notice about every time this trend line was tagged Bitcoin had a larger correction right not one of these little baby Corrections where it pulls back 20 25 30% but a larger correction at least a 50% drop after the trend line was tagged now again I'll be the first to say that 50% drops in crypto can occur at any time and it's always possible we're in the middle of one right now but I will say that you know you will go you will drive yourself crazy constantly trying to anticipate a crash I will say that this trend line here when it has been tagged in the past has not been a good signal now where is it right now right now we're up at about 6% where is is the trend line right now let me grab a a price label and let's just put it in May about 4% so and you can see previously when we hit it there it was 2.43 2.14 1.43 1% 7425 clearly a trend of higher lows 4% seems pretty far off right now but in the grand scheme of things it's not really when you consider that in October we were at 8% and just three weeks ago we were at 5% almost we almost hit 5% just a few weeks ago so if crypto we're to go back here right then we'd only be 1% away from this trend line now look at this look at the bull market support band for usdt dominance we're coming up to it right now right now in fact if you zoom in you will see that we just had a wick directly up to the 21 we EMA which is funny considering that we are very close to the 20we estimate in fact we would only need to see usdt dominance go up about four to 5% and there you have it it's at the 20we ese which is coincidental because Bitcoin happens to be about 6% from its po Mark sport ban the 21 we EMA so you have on one hand you have Bitcoin sort of fading here and I don't know if it's going to tag here or not but imagine if it did imagine if it did tag the bull Mark support band and imagine if usct dominance came all the way down here which again I don't know if it's going to but imagine if it did then history would suggest that it could be time for a larger correction in that type of scenario now that doesn't mean that you can't have Corrections even throughout this ENT en time I mean you know when when dominance was way up here at 6% you know and it was at 30k we still saw a drop 50% to 15K right so that's not to say that you can't have Corrections when usct dominance is high we know that you can and we've experienced it many times I'm just simply pointing out that all prior times where usdt dominance hit this trend line that is where the is a much larger Trend reversal in the asset class right now there's a caveat to this and I would be remiss if I didn't at least mention it because this is a linear scale right it's a linear scale and that's certainly one way to look at it in fact I think it is the more worthwhile to way more more worthwhile way to look at it I think looking at percentages on a log scale doesn't really make a whole lot of sense be that as it may to flip this to a log scale and to connect the same trend lines basically you would see that we're actually already at it right you'd see that we we're already at it again I don't know how how much trust to put into the log version of this chart versus the linear I think linear makes more sense and one of the reasons I would say that would be because if you add up usdt dominance plus usdc dominance and perform the same exercise on a log scale if you were to connect the dots you can see that it already broke below right but on the other hand if you flip it to a regular scale if you flip this usdt dominance plus usdc dominance to a regular scale you can see that it has not yet broken right and you can see that there's periods where it tagged it and then it went up one of the reasons why this has been the case that you know usdc plus USD dominance looks so much different is that the mark market cap of usdc went down a lot right I mean like it's trying to gain back some some market share now it's trying to but it's been mostly going down for a long time whereas if you add on here so if we take usdc dominance plus usct dominance you can see that it's moving up but it's because usdt dominance is moving up a lot more recently than usdc okay so I guess the question is is Will Bitcoin hold support or not if Bitcoin is unable to hold support at you know the bull market support band or somewhere above it if it's unable to hold support then I imagine perhaps looking at the log version of the stable coin dominance market cap would be better than the linear version if Bitcoin holds support here and bounces into the having like if it if if Bitcoin gets some type of of if it finds some type of support down there or here and bounces into the having if you go look at Market cycle Ro right and you look at at sort of where we are right now right like we're we're actually kind of right in between where we normally are at this phase it shows you the current cycle the purp line with the last two and you can see that the last two cycles had another push higher but it didn't come until you know about day 500 which is about two months from now well two months from now is March the end of March meaning you're knocking on the door of April which is in fact the having now when you think about it crypto has been very much following these narratives whether it was ether pumping up into the merge whether it was Bitcoin pumping into the spot ETF whether it might be Bitcoin getting some type of renewed interest going into the hav who knows right but that's about two months from now March late March early April and so I have to wonder well that I think is what we have to look at right is is does Bitcoin hold support if Bitcoin holds support in this area and bounces out of it then does usct dominance go back to this longer term trend line and if it does would that be a signal to the market that things are are very very overheated again right now we just simply at 6% we were at 8 and half per over here this trend line would put it at around 4% so it's really hard to say if Bitcoin were to fall back in to where it was previous or sorry if usct dominance were to fall back into to where it was previously it would already be at 5% which again it's only 1% away from that trend line right to go for well I mean depends on how you measure it right but you know from 5% to 4% from here to here and you saw how quickly it went from 8% down to to 5% I mean it it did it within just a couple of months late October until really early to mid January so about two and a half months we went from 8% to 5% now we've gone all the way back up to 6.32% at the bull market support band so that's going to be something that I'm going to be watching over the next few months is can Bitcoin find support in this range and if it can and it bounces then of course we'll have to see if it can actually take out the prior highs note that in 2019 it did not take out that long Wick to the upside it just put in a lower high in 2021 after this sort of this long Wick we eventually swept that high so I think this is a useful metric I'm not asking you to take it to the bank right they're not going to cash it in I can promise you that but in terms of being an investor in the cryptoverse and understanding that there are occasional 50% drops this is one of the metrics that could give you insight into that now remember we've had 50% drops even when dominance of usct was way up here right we have if you think back to you know I mean right here right I mean in March 2022 usct dominance was at 4% and it went up a lot so just because you're at a high usct dominance level doesn't mean that you can't have a 50% correction so I don't think that this indicator will tell you about every 50% correction that's about to occur but history shows us that it might be useful in ident ifying some of them and so if we find usct dominance at 4% sometime by I don't know in the next few months in the first half of the year then it could be a warning sign that there's about to be a larger rotation within the cryptoverse remember if Bitcoin gets a bounce let's call it off of I mean I know some people think that it's already found a local low and they could be right I don't really know um you know it's possible that 38 385 is the local low but if it's not and Bitcoin falls back in remember that next range you're looking at is 36 to 37k so 36,000 to $337,000 so if it falls back in here and usdt dominance Rises up to there and if Bitcoin bounces off of that level which again remember Bitcoin has typically visited that bull market sport band around this time in the cycle February February of the having year it seems to be this like recurring theme February of the having year we find ourselves at the bullmark sport band now last cycle we found ourselves not only at the bullmark sport band but quite a bit lower than it um and so that was of course an issue but note that in February of 2020 we had already tagged this trend line on a linear scale the other thing that I would like to see happen at some point is I I'd like to see The Ether Bitcoin valuation breakdown right you know right now it's at 05553 so 0.553 um it has had a a a bit of a bounce here which I mean again you know we set the further we get into January without a weekly close below the prior range low the more likely it is to get a bounce we got a bounce right well so what right we got bounces over here too and we got bounces over here too and eventually it still faded to the downside right here it broke through in October right here it broke through in July so sort of the question mark remember when it broke through in July of 2019 it broke through right as the First Rate cut arrived right as the First Rate cut arrived and the First Rate cut is potentially pushed out until May maybe we won't get one in March and remember last cycle Bitcoin topped out about a month before the First Rate cut so maybe that would lead us to believe that if rate Cuts occur in March then it's more likely that could be a local top for a while but if rate Cuts don't occur until say may or something then maybe there's an increased chance of of getting back to those levels the reason I'd say that is because rate Cuts would would sort of be indicative of of something wrong right especially with inflation as high as it is so as long as the FED keeps pushing out when the First Rate cut is then you know it sort of implies that the market um or that the Fed is not too concerned about the market or the economy but once rate Cuts arrive that's where ether Bitcoin at least last cycle broke down and just a little bit after that that was where Bitcoin dominance topped out so hopefully we can use this in the future to better understand when larger Corrections in the cryptoverse might occur just simply looking at a trend line on usdt dominance and also to remember that you could flip this to a log scale and potentially say that a warning signal has already arrived I think I would prefer the linear scale linear scale seems like it makes a bit more sense um than looking at it on a log scale but if there is a larger correction in crypto um right now like let's suppose we don't hold support at the 20we SMA and we go further down like let's say we go to the 100 we moving average then I imagine we might take a closer look at this and say all right maybe maybe it's worthwhile to look at on a log scale instead that's where we stand that is just what I wanted to provide analysis of today usdt dominance we also looked at usdt and usdc dominance together and I think by looking at the market through the lens of stable coins it might give us insight into some but not all future larger drops in the cryptoverse if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-01-25 00:00:00,"The video discusses the use of stablecoin dominance as a potential indicator for anticipating larger corrections in the cryptocurrency market. The presenter analyzes the historical trend of higher lows in the USDT (Tether) dominance chart, noting that each time this trend line was tested, it was followed by significant drops in the crypto market, such as the 50% declines seen in November 2021, May 2021, February 2020, and other instances. The presenter suggests that currently, USDT dominance is approaching the 4% level, which has acted as a support line in the past. If USDT dominance were to reach this level, it could signal the potential for a larger correction in the crypto market, although the presenter acknowledges that corrections can occur even when USDT dominance is high. The video also discusses the differences between using a linear scale versus a logarithmic scale when analyzing the USDT and USDC dominance charts, and the potential implications for the analysis. The presenter notes that the log scale suggests the warning signal has already been triggered, while the linear scale indicates the trend line has not yet been breached.Overall, the sentiment of the video is cautiously bearish, as the presenter highlights the potential for a larger correction in the crypto market based on the historical patterns observed in the stablecoin dominance metrics. The main message and conclusion is that the stablecoin dominance trend line could be a useful indicator for identifying potential larger corrections in the cryptocurrency market, although the presenter advises against relying on it as the sole basis for investment decisions.",309,"[0.076538086, 0.0023860931, 0.021240234, -0.018035889, 0.011657715, -0.035186768, 0.052246094, -0.037109375,

Benjamin Cowen,Bitcoin: Early Halving Year Pattern (Update),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeLu4VoASCg,"Video Transcript of youtube video 'Bitcoin: Early Halving Year Pattern (Update)' by 'Benjamin Cowen' released on 2024-01-24 00:00:00

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to provide an update on the early havinge price action pattern that we previously outlined if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptoverse spot ETF we said that we will likely get a pullback about mid January and then after the spot ETF occurred and we were back over here you know at around 42k one of the things we noted in this video over here where we talked about the early having year pattern is that what tends to happen is you get a dip early on in the having year so take a look at 2024 and then compare it to 2020 um and 2016 and 2012 right so in all cases in all prior cases for Bitcoin sometime in q1 there was a correction that took Bitcoin anywhere from between 15 to you know 30% below the yearly open right so the yearly open for Bitcoin this year is 42 or sorry 42,2 79 so from 42279 a 15% drop puts you at around 36k okay now remember there's no guarantee it's going to play out like prior Cycles I'm just simply pointing out historical draw Downs at this phase of the cycle right and again in 2016 looks like the Max draw down was about 16% in 2012 it looks like Max draw down was about 16 177% as well so far from the yearly open at this point Bitcoin has dropped about 8 and a half% 8 to %. right so it has been a a you know somewhat of a substantial drop and you know it's easy to look at a drop like this and come to all sorts of conclusions but I think it's also important to you know to try to stay as true to the Chart as we can and say well look at this point this correction has not evolved into anything more than what we've already seen it doesn't mean that it can't but if you were to look at the pullback in February of 2023 going into March was about a 22% drop and then this drop here right was about a 21% drop this drop here was also about a 21% drop and coincidentally enough this drop so far has been about a 21% drop so while it certainly has felt like a large pullback right I mean 48 49k all the way down to 39K it is still it's still within the realm realm of what we have seen over the last year um so if it were to fall to the 20we SMA or the bull marks wor been it would actually have to fall further than it has fallen during these other three prior Corrections the one way that both could be true where we go to the bullmark SW band but Bitcoin doesn't fall too much further would be if it just takes a while and you know the 20we SMA just sort of slowly curls up here right and then you know bitcoin price action just sort of Fades into that something like that could happen in fact that has what has been happening for bitcoin price action in a lot of these prior Corrections is that it kind of slowly faded back to it and like here's an example where it was still above it and we got to pop back up and then it still faded back down a few weeks later and we had a long Wick down same thing over here right it got close didn't make it to the bullmark squ band and then it popped back up only then a few weeks later only then drop back down again right so those sorts of patterns could of course repeat themselves you know you could go to the 20we SMA but it doesn't mean that you have to immediately drop to it um if it were to play out like these prior patterns and looking at say like the short-term risk that we were talking about in the last video it's a slow process down right where the where the extension from the 20we SMA just sort of slowly goes back down to where we get back to that bull market support band right so you know we are getting relatively close um again just to reiterate while I talk about the short-term stuff I do not think it makes sense to try to time the market in this way uh you know for me as I've said before I buy when the risk is low the risk metric's low and then I I take profits when the risk levels are high um but I I don't try to time each individual move based on on this sort of Outlook one other thing that we could look at is that 50-day moving average we covered that a little bit as well so the 50-day SMA uh for Bitcoin we have fallen below it about about 10% you can see that prior drops below the 50-day SMA were closer to that one was about 14% this one was about 14% And then this one right here was about 14% so if it were if Bitcoin were to drop 14% below the 50-day SMA from where it you know sort of crossed down a 14% drop actually puts it at around 37k you know we we've mentioned a lot that sort of those High the high 30k range is going to be where you know if the Bulls are going to hold the line that's where they're going to want to do it in this high 30k range um and so here we are right we're in the high 30k range we'll see if that happens the other thing of course to just to remain aware of is the the 100 we estimate right or sorry yeah this is the the 100 we moving average so this is sort of like a a different scenario where if the Market support ban doesn't hold like 2019 right if it if it doesn't hold then the 100 we ese is I think what you would look towards next so the 100 we ese is currently around 28k which coincidentally is is sort of slowly starting to go back up to where the prior breakout Zone was right slow slowly starting to go back up so if it plays out like this and we get a drop below the bullmark support band sometime in the next couple of months then I think you would be looking towards that that 100 we moving average um as as sort of the next level that that could theoretically hold as support there's other ways that we can look at the market as well there's the uh the fear the fear and greed Index this has been putting in um you can see that it has been putting in higher lows and higher highs for a while so the current fear and greed index reading is at 48 so this one might be a one to keep an eye on the prior low was all the way down at 30 right all the way down at at 30 so a pretty big drop that we got back in September so um we'll see if this one can can do that same thing again if it if it puts in a lower low then that could be a sort of a sign that the trend is changing but otherwise I would look to see if it if it continues the pattern so this is sort of just you know I just wanted to provide an update on on this early year having pattern where Bitcoin does get this pullback and and it's actually sorry it's actually happened several times in fact and in fact in in both of the last two cycles when it had this pullback again this is just a fact right it's not a this is not a this is what Ben thinks this is just a fact in both of the last two cycles when Bitcoin had a pullback in q1 we tested both the bullmark sport band and the 100 we moving average right so it happened right here and then in the last cycle it happened right here but in both cases when we held support one we didn't in both cases both of those were eventually Tagged so we're getting kind of close right and I don't want to give you the impression that there's a guarantee that we even drop to the 20we ese you know the market can surprise and you know I mean it's always possible that it it it gets a pot back up and and then leaves everyone second guessing themselves for another two months um so that's why I say I would just I would come up with a strategy stick to it whether it's based on risk levels or something else stick to it and um go forward like that as far as altcoins go because I I I see people ask me about altcoins in the comments a lot as far as altcoins go they're always as always they're going to be dependent on bitcoin if Bitcoin bounces then it would likely raise the altcoin market up if Bitcoin drops then the altcoin market will get wrecked even harder so for instance to get back to the bullmark sport band for Bitcoin to get back to say the 21 week EMA it's only about a 5% drop whereas for the altcoin market to get back to that level 21 we EMA it's about a 7 to8 8% drop right so you can see how the altcoin market is is more volatile as the as these moves play out and that's one of the reasons why we see the Bitcoin dominance just kind of slowly keep grinding up because as Bitcoin falls back into the bull market support band that's exactly what happens is alts fall a bit harder if you think back to earlier in 2023 there was a period over here where Bitcoin was falling back into the bull market support band and if you were to Overlay Bitcoin dominance onto the chart you can see the dominance was starting to go up before we got that bounce right before that bounce occurred and so whether we get a bounce or not it seems likely that dominance would continue to go up as this move continues right and even in this move over here there were some weeks where Bitcoin popped back up I mean like it it got pretty close to the 20we SMA and then it got a a 5% weekly candle right a 5% weekly candle from the current price would put Bitcoin back at you know 42k or so so just trying to give people you know the perspective here on the market and to say look I mean I I I know that it it certainly seems like this has been a large pullback but at this point it's actually been a pretty standard pullback and when you look at the year-to date Roi of this year compared to 2016 it's actually pretty closely still following it right now again if if a Black Swan event were to occur if if the economy were to slow down then yes we could deviate from this stuff that that's exactly what happened in 2020 right I mean we we deviated from it and we had a much larger drop but I'm just trying to show you that every single cycle early on in the having year we've had a drop in q1 that took us you know between 15 to 30% below the yearly open this cycle that would correspond you know to hitting the high 30k range which is where we've been uh even going a bit lower would still be within the realm of historical Norms this reaction is going to be a very important reaction okay because if it bounces which is what it you know you can see there's examples over here where it gets to the 20we estimate and then bounces if it bounces then the dominance of Bitcoin should absolutely soar and if that is the case then I imagine ether Bitcoin would would likely take a hit so again probably going it's probably going to stay relatively boring for a little bit longer you know in terms of thinking about a mid January correction the the whole idea was that it would take at least a few weeks if not a couple of months um and and so far we're we're sort of in our third week of the correction some of these Corrections over here took a lot longer right so I could still drag on for another you know three to four weeks easily and not be out of the realm of of what we've historically seen so you know I I think that these markets are are are exhausting for everyone draining for everyone um there's certainly a lot of different views on on how things are going to play out but again all I can stress is that it's important to have a plan and stick to it no matter what and if we do get a larger drop then these three right if we get a larger drop where either it goes to the to this level here or the 100 week or even lower you need to have a plan in place so you know how to navigate that right you don't want to be the person that goes into it not having a plan and then you end up capitulating something only then regret it a few months later so make sure you have a plan stick to it we've outlined likely outcomes hopefully it's useful to you guys thank you for tuning in make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up and I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-01-24 00:00:00,"The video provides a detailed technical analysis of the Bitcoin market, focusing on the historical patterns observed during the early stages of the halving cycle. The speaker notes that Bitcoin typically experiences a 15-30% pullback in Q1 following the halving, and the current correction appears to be within this historical range. The video discusses potential support levels, including the 20-week EMA and the 100-week EMA, and suggests that the high 30k range could be a key level for the bulls to defend. The overall sentiment is cautiously bullish, with the speaker advising viewers to have a plan in place to navigate potential larger drops, while also noting that the market can surprise and that it's important to stick to a strategy based on risk levels rather than trying to time the market. The main message is that the current correction is within the expected range for the early halving year pattern, and that investors should have a plan in place to manage the potential risks and opportunities in the market.",200,"[-0.0062332153, -0.012817383, 0.0071983337, 0.017593384, -0.02015686, -0.0060272217, 0.021820068, -0.028137207, 0.057373047, 0.03753662, -0.020233154, -0.039733887,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing returns in the having year if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse tocom the having year is always an interesting year for Bitcoin there does tend to be more volatility in the having year than in the pre having year and I just want to go through historically what has happened keeping in mind that what has historically happened does not have to be what plays out this time but it is something that I I just wanted to show the first thing we can look at are the prior three having years so 2012 2016 and 2020 and what you'll notice is that in all prior having years there was a dip sometime with within the first 3 months now the dip that occurred in 2020 was obviously the most aggressive and I know that it shows it only going down here to about 30% down but we actually know it it went much further than that when you include the Wicks okay um but from the yearly open anyways but in all three cases in all three cases you can see that after about a 100 days okay so after about 3 months we were essentially still at the yearly open so go look at what bitcoin's yearly open is right now so it's it's around 42k around 42k so what would be interesting is that what this what this chart here is suggesting is that on average right if you look at all prior having years on average after about 3 months the price of Bitcoin is still at the yearly open right but also what you'll notice we talked about this going into the having year is that you get a dip sometime in the first few months of the having year and and in all three cases it went down at least at least 15% or so from from the yearly open right so if we look closer you can see that in 2016 we went all the way down to about 16% down off the yearly open same thing in 2012 maybe about 17% down 2020 it went about 30% down it actually went further than that if you include the Wicks so to give you an idea of what that would mean remember the yearly open is  around 42.3k so 42.3k um if we were to take a price range here so 15% drop gets you to around the the 36k level the reason why 36k is interesting is because that's right around where the bull market sport band is right so that's that would be about a 15% drop from the yearly open uh 2020 we know let me look at it on on a smaller time scale here so we can look a little bit closer so the yearly open remember was around 42.3 so a 15% drop gets you basically to that bull Mark sport band right that's where I would put it a 30% drop which is what happened in 2020 uh not including the wick would actually get you back down to around 29k which coincidentally is is actually right around where that that 100 we SMA is right that 100 we moving average is right around that level and the reason we've you know sort of pointed both of those potential targets out is that in at least in the last couple of Cycles you know not only have we gone back and tested the 100 we SMA around January February of the having year you can see that we also tested the 100 we estimate right so here they corresponded to the same value here they didn't but we ended up testing both of them right the bull Mark SP band and the 100 we SMA over here in 2012 you can see that we tested the bull market support ban in February but we had just tested the 100 week in December right so it was slightly accelerated tested the 100 week in December and then tested the bull market support band in in q1 but in all prior cases right in all prior cases sometime you know around this time of the cycle Bitcoin was testing you know either the bull market support band or the 100 we moving average now there's no guarantee that this happens this time right I mean I have to be clear I these these sorts of you know I don't really want to call call them predictions because I'm not really trying to predict here I'm just saying hey this is what's historically happened but these sort of forecasts they sometimes pan out and then sometimes they don't right so you're saying could go up down or sideways yes yes basically that's what I'm saying the point is that there is a risk in the market that around this time of the cycle uh we get a a you know we get these dips right and we're actually in one right now I mean if you look at at where we are right now so this is 2012 2016 2020 here's 2024 right I mean you can see that 2024 at least at the current time is most closely following what happened in in 2016 right so look at this at the current time it looks the closest to 2016 than the others and structurally there's a lot of other similarities right as well and and so and and when you when you're if you're curious about what I'm talking about it's basically like in terms of looking at um you know like this structure here finally breaking out of it right so you have these highs here you finally break out and then you back test so then again you sort of these you you come up to a level and then you eventually break out and then you you sort of back test the breakout point it looks you know more similar to that right where you have these levels that you finally break out of and so then the question right is is will it will it eventually test this there's you know we we've talked about the having actually before as well um you know on more than on more than one occasion um here here was a video this is kind of an interesting video that I I did back in in 2022 this was when Bitcoin was like 30k and we basically suggested hey it's probably going to go down uh go to the regression ban spend some time down here and then eventually break out to the upside now it's hard to see exactly what price that that is but there's another video that I put out uh and this is just sort of um an interesting video that I I got the path completely wrong on right completely wrong on but this this video was was put out three years ago so we this video was put out right around the third having and the idea was when I put this video out I I made it Bitcoin Fair valuation at the next having in 2024 but you can see that I put this video out at in at the 2020 having and I said that in the fourth having the fair value right the quote unquote fair value will be 40 to 50K which again I mean at the time it seemed absurd and you can see that the path I drew out did not play out at all right I mean we went up but this this major Peak over here actually got shifted here right it was actually here and we also did not go as high but regardless of of that the funny thing is that we're still um right around that level right between 40 to 50K at the fourth having okay so going back to this chart right now we are at 41.5k history shows that basically through the first three to four months of the having Year let me just take an average let's take the average of all of all election years right so that's the having year and then we will just show that one and then the current year so history shows that on average after four months bitcoin's price is still where it was at the yearly open in the having year after the first four months so if that is true right if four months from now or let's say three months from now because we're already mostly through January let's say if 3 months from now Bitcoin is still between you know let's say sorry let's say 3 months from now Bitcoin is at its yearly open its yearly open is of course 42.3k 42.3k puts Bitcoin still between 40 to 50K meaning this prediction of 40 to 50K by the fourth having that was made four years ago will will actually be true now there are caveats to all this by the way one of the interesting things and I I I I like to I tie this in because I think it's actually really really important The Ether Bitcoin pair remember what we said uh in the last video we said that the next window for ether Bitcoin to break down is likely no sooner than March right no sooner than March now this is where you know if it breaks down in February um that would certainly lead to to nice a nice Price look guys my view is that it breaks down I don't really care when it does it right I I mean if it does it tomorrow then great you know that that's fine with me but what I am saying is that often times when you get these breaks up by Ether Bitcoin it takes at least a couple of months for it to come back down right and and and break the low right at least a couple of months and here it took you know you can see that it came back down in May and then again in June here it came back down in in October but what's interesting and and again we we've sort of looked at this in the through the lens of of rate Cuts right and noting that ether Bitcoin broke down here during rate cuts it didn't know we weren't getting rate Cuts over here but we were right here and so there's another way to think about this not through the lens of rate Cuts but just through the lens of of seasonality right when could Bitcoin make another move if it's going to right well his shows that it wouldn't occur until sometime out you know in April or May I'm not saying that it can't go up I mean even in the having year uh even in the last having year Bitcoin went up but the next more durable move didn't occur until sometime you know around April or May so it's possible that that corresponds to Ether breaking down against Bitcoin right a few months from now remember it's often it's not always Bitcoin rallies that breaks ether down but a lot of times it is right it's it's a it's a Bitcoin rally that breaks The Ether Bitcoin pair down there are times where ether Bitcoin goes down while Bitcoin is going down here's a great example of ether Bitcoin capitulating during a time where where Bitcoin was going down but the point is that you know both of these prior breakdowns here was when Bitcoin was was in fact going up this one here was was actually you know when it actually broke down in July it was on on on a slightly lower high but the the lower high was compared to the the higher high was just occurred you know just before it so you have to think that if money does Flow Away from eth and back to bitcoin sometime in April or May that could cause ether to break down against Bitcoin and again on average that's where you know that's where Bitcoin would start to um you know potentially come out of of of a de now I know what a lot of people are thinking right I mean this is great and all but you know will it will it continue to follow that for the entire year I don't know I mean I don't I you know I think there's even if you look at at at 2020 I mean it was we had a great start to the year and then what happened was we had you know a Black Swan event and then Bitcoin just absolutely crashed and it and it retested these prior lows more or less you know we also had a period over here where we retested the lows and so you know I I look at this chart and I say well you know is there going to be some type of larger event like that where you go back down and and you sort of retest those lows and you know the there's there's certainly part of me that thinks that it's possible um I mean if it can if it can happen last cycle and if it can happen the cycle before that then why can't it happen this cycle you know um maybe you know maybe we get a flash crash or something that takes us back down makes everyone think that it's truly over and then it goes back up that I mean that's what happened last cycle but I can't promise that that will happen right I can't it could happen I me we could we could also come back down here and then go back up you know if you think about if you think about having your Roi one of the reasons that I think that you know it it it typically has Behavior like this is because by the time you get closer and closer to the election you know the the the politicians are going to want some type of looser monetary policy so that you're not going into the election with rising delinquencies in small businesses right I mean if if small business delinquencies continue to go up which is what's going on right now you know you're not going to want to go into an election with that right and so the way to sort of alleviate that is to go back to lower interest rates to go back to quantitative easing there and and again you know if you look at at Market expectations they're constantly changing um but what's funny is that now the market is not thinking the First Rate cut occurs until May not until May which is funny because May is right around the time that this occurs right where you can see that all prior three Cycles went up and also May would be when the next you know if it hasn't broken down in March maybe ether Bitcoin would then come back down to these lows by May right and then break down so you know I I I think when you know when I think about where we are in the cycle um I mean it certainly seems like we we were on that same fair value that we outlined about four years ago and that we talked about in this video but there is this looming thing of well what's going to make the FED go back to looser monetary policy right in 2020 it took a a pretty big event to go back to much lower rates right and to really turn the money printer back on over here in 2015 2016 we we did not have a recession um but we did have a recession scare right we we came close to a recession in 2015 and 2016 and if you look at where Bitcoin retested the the bull market support band and the 100 week moving average that was in February of 2016 well remember in February of 2016 if I show you what was going on that was when that was when basically the S&P it had this drop here late 2015 but then it had another drop in 2016 right and and you can see that when it had this drop that is when Bitcoin had this drop here back to the one 100 we moving average and the bullmark sport band and then last cycle last cycle when um when we had a hard Landing right you guys know what happened with the hard Landing right the S&P dropped a lot right I mean it it fell off a cliff and when that happened Bitcoin yes it went back to the bullmark sport band um but it also went to the 100 week and it went a lot lower and it and it more or less put in a a macro higher low and so there's a lot of volatility in the having year right but that's not always just to the upside it can also be to the downside as well often times the downside volatility is what causes looser monetary policy to come back into play right so you get some type of of major riskof event and after that RI and because of that riskof event the FED pivots and and then sometimes after they've pivoted enough they've gone back to sufficiently looser monetary policy and and and you know and and QE then you you sort of you put in your macro higher low whatever it's going to be over here you know it was a double bottom and then and then we went up this double bottom occurred on the first drop by the S&P right I mean if you guys remember what I was showing with the S&P um 2015 2016 right it had two drops right this there's this first drop here in August September there's a second drop here in February right and in in that second drop it got back to the 100 week the first drop it it put in the double bottom okay so having years are always interesting in that regards because you know the feds probably going to have more they're probably going to feel more pressure to to go back to looser rates sometime before the election so that's where we more or less are right now right bitcoin's between 40 to 50K um sort of still following this outline although the peak occurred at a completely different time um it's still following this outline but I I I do wonder if this is the next stop okay the bull Mark sport band around 36k which by the way I mean again a 36k Bitcoin while it might sounds scary it's only 15% below the yearly open and remember that's where basically all prior having years have gone at least was 15% below the yearly open so I think it's relevant to think that 36k could come into play um and that will it will be important to see what the reaction is at 36k because if there if if the Bulls do not come out to defend at 36k then the next level that you're looking at is all the way back down here at 31k okay so I'll say that again again if they can't defend at 36 then your next level of potential support is all the way down at 31 now remember last time we sliced through all that stuff and we went a lot lower time before that we held it as support so it it really just depends on on you know how the macro evolves is it continue to evolve very slowly if it does continue to evolve very slowly then bitcoin's more likely to hold these things you know one of these levels as support right whether it be the bullmark SP band or whether it be the 100 we moving average if the macro evolves more quickly and and things deteriorate more quickly then you could get something like this where you get a hard landing and then we go back to to you know to to loose your monetary policy a lot more quicker so again it depends on on on how things play out I think on the macro side that dictates just how deep a drop you can get now there's also the other view which probably merits our attention as well and that's the view that it doesn't break down at all Beyond this level right I mean there's there's some people out there uh that that have views that say it won't break below 40K right I know some people are are suggesting that and you know I do think the longer you're in crypto the more you recognize just how valid it is to listen to everyone's view okay because if you think about it at every at every turning point in the market there's always a lot of people that it's easy to laugh at people that have a different view right but it's important to listen to what those people are saying because they represent a certain percentage of of the population right if like if they think that then there's probably a lot of other people that think that too you know if if if someone thinks that this is going to be the high for a long time because this is where you know this was the the 618 retracement that we talked about you know 48k 482k this is where the um you know this is where the the spot ETF you know was was launched and we know that when you launch these products it can it can Mark highs for a while right but there's also someone out there that thinks the opposite and thinks that yeah like okay fine uh it's marked at least a local high but we just have to cool off for a little bit and then we'll go put in a higher high right so I think it's easy for no matter what camp you fall into to ignore the other view but consider both views as as useful views of the market and just know know that yes while you have your view there's also a lot of people that have a different view um and consider that and the reason I say consider that is because it's useful to hedge right it's always worthwhile to hedge in the market and and that means you know if you have if you have the view that that this is the high for a long time do know that even if you know even if we do come back into these levels there could be a reaction where people you know try to buy again and try to hold that as support whether it be here or whether it be over here but if Bitcoin let's look at lower time frames right if you look at like a 4H hour time frame you can see that 40K is a pretty important level okay so 40K this is the level that I'm sure everyone's watching right so you can see that we got above 40K here held us support here we did not we got close to testing it there but not quite and then we just tested it again so we've talked about 36k we talked about 30k Etc but until 40K breaks that Still Remains a question mark right now I would say if 40K breaks we're like going to go down to the to you know to to the mid-30s right 36k run the bullmark SP Bend if it takes another four weeks then maybe it's only 38k or something I don't know but if 40K breaks I think you you know you likely at the very least you come back down and you test this level right right here 38k so I I think that is a a a relevant area to say all right well if 40K breaks then 38k would be the next level which is where the bullmark sport Bend will be in you know in a few weeks right you know by the let's say by sometime in February around that 38k threshold so it'll be interesting to see how the how the market reacts at that level I am of the view that at some point at some point ether will break down against Bitcoin and normally that occurs you know on some type of of of Bitcoin balance it kind of goes back to the the the dominance video that we did yesterday right like dominance kind of sucks right now it's below its bullmark SW band but it's still trying to hold on right just like it was holding on right here for a while before it went back up so when I look at at at a chart like this right looking at at the Bitcoin dominance chart you know maybe it spends a few months or a few weeks you know sort of below the bullmark sport band but I can't help but think that at some point it's going to get another move up and and if and when it does then you know it could correspond to sometime out in a couple of months from now right a few months from now where then ether Bitcoin potentially finally breaks down so certainly a lot to consider um with this cycle and and how the and how the having stuff plays out the the the things I want to remind people of are that you know we do talk about the risk as much as we can we talk about the downside risk we talk about the upside risk um the downside being the bullmark sport band or the or the 100 we moving average in sort of a soft Landing type environment the a hard Landing scenario would would take you down to a you know to the prior lows right that's where a hard Landing scenario would take you and I do feel you know I I do feel like it's you know it can be the way that I talk about the markm is like it certainly could be thought of as as too risk averse right the reason why I say that let me show you this this um this view here and and this isn't a new view right I think everyone's aware aware of this View and if you're not then I you just haven't been watching um you know a lot of these videos but there there there's this idea and I again it's it's a dubious idea but it's the idea of of you know in your bare Market year you go to one regression band and then sometime later you go to the one below it which can correspond to a higher price right like this was this regression band we had a higher price but a lower regression man in the having year same thing over here right you go down to one regression man but eventually you you test the one below it and so that would sort of that's what I would consider to be a hard Landing would be if Bitcoin were to go and and test this regression band down here in some type of a a macro double bottom or a higher low or something like that right now the reason why it's risky for me to talk about this stuff is because while I will always say that my strategy for crypto investing is to DCA according to the risk levels that is what I do that is what is I I've always done that's what I plan to always do right I DCA according to the risk level and if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about it's it's this chart right here um this one so when the risk is low I DCA in when the risk is high I DCA out that's what I do now I sit on here talk about all sorts of possibilities all the time right we talk about whether Bitcoin bounces and breaks ether Bitcoin down we talk about whether bit Co gets you know some type of scare you know around the having and and leads to the FED going back to QE and and some type of macro retest we talk about all sorts of things right um but guess what I don't trade those views and I I I'm clear about that as frequently as I can be I don't trade these short-term views if the risk is low I buy if the risk is high I I start to sell and if you think about it it's not really the worst way to to go about about investing because otherwise you just spend all your time you know thinking about what if this and what if that what if you just say you set an alert you know if if x then y right if risk is below this level then I'll buy if risk is above that level then I sell and the rest of the time I'm enjoying my life right I'm not doing I don't care about about the other stuff I'm I'm just going to enjoy things and say all right well you know Bitcoin risk right now all right yeah it's it's at this level if it goes down to this level then I'll pick some up if it goes up to this level then yeah I need to take some profits right that's how I navigate crypto so I have to be clear about that and and and maybe I can do a better job of communicating that so when I say things like hey there is a risk that Bitcoin could go back down and and test the Integrity of these lows it's not like like I mean it's not like I'm I'm sitting there with you know with 100% cash waiting for some type of opportunity because the reality is is that even if that does occur even if we were to get some type of capitulation down to that level the truth is that 99.9% of people would not buy it anyways because they'd be watching for it to go lower so that's why I say you have to have a strategy and you just stick to it right you just stick to it no matter what happens okay so yes there is a risk that Bitcoin could could do what it's done previously right and and and and and put in some type of macro retest of the lows right there's a chance that it could do that there's also a chance that it doesn't do that right it's possible it's possible so again I think it makes sense to be HED either way right that way you know if Bitcoin does continue to outperform hey you have some Bitcoin but if we get some type of of massive drop then that's where you want to be you want you you want to make sure you have some money to buy the dop now I know what you're thinking you're probably thinking well you know isn't that the easy way out like to say well it could go up or it could go down we'll see here's the thing what I have said for the last two years is that the way that I hedge I don't really care how you hedge but the way that I hedge is I I just keep a Bitcoin heavy crypto portfolio right that's the way I hedge now some people have hedged by keeping an ether heavy portfolio or an altcoin heavy portfolio but I hedge by just keeping my portfolio Bitcoin heavy the reason for that is because even in a scenario where you get a hard Landing I still think Bitcoin would eventually recover right even in a hard Landing scenario unfortunately I can't say the same about every single altcoin and why do you think we put out all these Bitcoin dominance videos you know for the last two years you think it's because I just think hey I just want to bore people to tears for an hour every every few weeks no right we talk about the Bitcoin dominance because of what I've said previously if you think dominance is going to go higher over the longer term which a lot of people have given me crap for that view but it's been going up you know I I think back to the to the thousands of interactions I've had on Twitter X um and on YouTube and everywhere where people laughed at this view of dominance going up and and my Bitcoin heavy portfolio you know oh all these altcoins will outperform it I look back and I say well you know those people can laugh all they want but they were wrong dominance has gone up a lot and I think it's going to keep going up now I'll admit I could be wrong about the and keep going up part often times dominance doesn't go that much higher in the having year and there's some case to be made that is the high on dominance there's some case to be made that it could be but I still think that until we get back to looser monetary policy dominance is still going to be skewed to the upside and as as it turns out looser monetary policy keeps getting delayed you know I mean it it was potentially going to be a March rate cut now it's shifted over to May next week maybe it shifts back to March but if it doesn't occur until May then I think dominance will just keep on grinding higher yes it could go slightly lower in the meantime but I still think it will go up so yes people can laugh all they want about the Bitcoin dominance view they control these hourlong Bitcoin dominance videos but at the end of the day you look at this chart and it is just been going up for a long time right so going back to Bitcoin in terms of oh so you're saying it can go up or down the point is I I can't predict the market market in terms of where it's going to go I can't I have no problem saying that if you know I I think to like think about all the hedge funds there are right all these hedge funds where you have so many smart people simply trying to perform outperform the S&P 500 and like almost none of them can right almost none of them can if you think about it all these hedge funds they have like you know they hire these Quant phds from you know from the best institutions and if all of these people in a room can't outperform the S&P then why do I think I can right I don't I don't um and so I can't I can't predict where the Market's going to go I think it's okay for people to say that I don't I don't really get why that's such a a um a controversial view to have I cannot predict where the Market's going to go next week next month I don't know we put out predictions some of them turn true some of them don't um you know this one looks like it's okay this one was wrong I mean we're we're fourth having we're between 40 to 50K potentially but the peak occurred at a different time so when I look at at at charts like this for for Bitcoin and I think well you know where where is it most likely going to go in the short term I think there's a case to be made that it'll visit the bullmark Scorpion I think it could go down to the 100 week and if we get a hard Landing it can go a lot lower than that but I'm not betting everything I have on that right DCA strategy is is probably going to be um it's the best strategy I think over a longer time period right um rather than trying to time the bottom because even in the event that we come back down and and and do get that scare it could be like that where literally no one buys it and everyone and and and and you know you buy some but a lot of people think it's going to go lower so those are my views um you know going back to the uh to the having year stuff if you look at 2012 2016 2020 2024 it's pretty normal to have a dip around this time and it's also pretty normal for that dip to last and not durably get back above the yearly open until you know April or something and there's still no guarantee that we can't go back down and and and and get a scare even after that it it really just depends on on how the uh how the macro unfolds but I do want people to have a plan going into this stuff remember it's the risk that you take right you have to figure out what risk you want to take on what you don't um how to be hedged for for various potential outcomes and and um just take it from there so those are my views on the market I just want to provide an update on on where we are in the having year right now I still do think ether Bitcoin will eventually break down but it you know it certainly could still be a couple of months away um I'm thinking the first half of the year is my best guess sometime in in H1 of of the having year is when ether Bitcoin will break down finally and after it breaks down I think that will within a within a couple of months I think that'll Mark the low on ether Bitcoin um but I don't think we're there yet but I do think we will get there so if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to

discusses the historical performance of Bitcoin during its having years, which occur every 4 years when the Bitcoin mining reward is halved. The analysis shows that in prior having years, Bitcoin typically experiences a dip of around 15-30% in the first 3-4 months, before recovering to around the yearly open price. The presenter suggests this pattern could repeat, potentially leading Bitcoin to test the bull market support band around $36K or the 100-week moving average around $29K. However, the presenter acknowledges this is not a guarantee and that Bitcoin could also avoid a significant dip.The video also discusses the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin often improves a few months after the Bitcoin having. The presenter believes that Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin will eventually break down, with this likely occurring sometime in the first half of the current having year.Overall, the sentiment is cautiously bullish, acknowledging potential downside risks in the near-term but maintaining a positive long-term outlook. The presenter suggests that a diversified, Bitcoin-heavy portfolio may be the best approach to navigate the potential volatility, rather than attempting to time the market perfectly. The presenter emphasizes the importance of having a clear investment strategy and sticking to it, rather than trying to predict the market's exact movements.",270,"[0.012878418, -0.030471802,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin more specifically we're going to be discussing Bitcoin dominance if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom let's go ahead and jump in so the videos that we do on bitcoin dominance do tend to be longer so a iies for that I have a feeling this will be long as well um I have tried to keep some of the more recent videos much shorter but it is nice sometimes to just go slow go through the various parts of the market talk about various aspects talk about potential invalidation levels uh and and counter points and just trying to put the the pieces of the puzzle together so this video we're going to talk about Bitcoin dominance we're going to be going through a lot of different things and and hopefully you find it useful so the the first thing I I want to say is you know last year was a really interesting year because last year was a year where going into the year there were a lot of people that that scoffed at the idea of of dominance going back up to even 51% right um I think a lot of people were really convinced that it was going to break down and the General argument was that well the asset class is much bigger than Bitcoin now therefore the dominance can't go back up to where it was previously now I will admit that I don't think Bitcoin dominance is going back to 73% I don't um I think that's a common misconception uh what I what I think is theoretically possible is 60% now there are no guarantees about that prediction I I do have to admit that and to some degree I'm I'm happy that it's gone as far as it has at around 55% especially considering when it was back at 38% even 55% seemed like a farfetch but in this video we're going to explore can it go higher than that 55% threshold I I do see a lot of people out there in the cryptoverse that that put out some compelling reasons why why 55% could be the top um and and so I do want to at least look at the other side of the story and see is there any evidence at all to suggest that it actually could go higher than that level one thing you might first notice and I just want to get this part out of the way is these circles over here because I want to delete these circles I just want to sort of explain why I have them on there there's this pattern that I was looking at with regards to to two Bitcoin dominance so you can look at this pattern here purple green green two Blues right you just keep putting in lower lows you break that level you go back down sort of a double bottom break out now look at the same chart look at the same pattern on the US dollar currency index chart the the US dollar Index you see the similarities right you got your purple purple circle up here your Peak then you drop you put in a low and then you put in a high same thing then you put in a lower low then you put in a lower high same thing with dxy right a lower low and then a lower high and then dominance did another lower low and then it took out these prior highs and it put in a higher high right so a lower low and then a higher high and the dollar actually did the same thing right a lower low and then a higher high and then after that higher high it came back down and put in a higher low which is the same thing that the dollar just did right it put in a higher low and then after doing that what dominance did was it it went back up to the bull market support man got rejected put in a double bottom and then was Off to the Races now look at where the dollar is right now same pattern so far up until now and potentially where it is is right at that bull market support bin now I don't know if it's going to continue to repeat this pattern or not but if the dollar were to continue to repeat the pattern then it means at some point in this window turning back around coming back down to the sort of this pink circle confirming this as the bottom and then moving higher okay now you might say Ben this is a great and all but this video is on bitcoin dominance so what the hell are you doing talking about the US dollar currency index well I think they are related in some regard take a look at at what happened with the dollar back over here in July of 2023 do you see how it went up for how many weeks in a row starting here it went up you can see 10 10 so this the the spread here was 10 meaning there is 11 Green weeks in a row right just count them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 11 Green weeks in a row start starting in Late July now look at Bitcoin dominance what happened with Bitcoin dominance starting in August so about a month later you can see it had nine or 10 green weeks in a row so the dubious argument right is that if the dollar if the US dollar currency index goes up aggressively then so too could the dominance Bitcoin right the dollar going up you know sort of implies a a riskof type of environment but not always there are periods where the dollar has gone up and Bitcoin went up with it if you don't believe me uh just go look at at at 2016 2016 was a was an example where the dollar went up here and if you were to Overlay uh Bitcoin USD onto the chart you can see that Bitcoin was also going up even when the dollar was going up right so in general though we know that if the dollar is going up aggressively then markets prefer blue chips over riskier stuff right and so the dominance could go up so we get into a situation where if the dollar is in some type of bottoming process and and again remember this could continue to go on for some time it could it could get rejected here it might not I mean maybe it deviates but if it does get rejected comes back down and puts in a double bottom and then starts to go back up that could be sort of a signal that dominance is about to take off once again again regardless of the direction of Bitcoin USD I've said that for probably a year and a half now right the dominance will go up regardless of the direction of Bitcoin USD now again mostly Bitcoin has gone up right but again that's part of the thesis right it doesn't matter what way Bitcoin goes the dominance should go up either way now that's sort of one side of it to think about how the dollar relates to it and by the way if you know if you don't if you don't like the way this looks I mean one way to look at this is some type of massive accumulation zone right um but another way to visualize this is maybe take the inverse of of the dollar right if you take the inverse so the dollar um you can see that I I I I must have talked about this in a prior video but sort of that a distribution right sort of these distribution phases up here and again it could come all the way back down here now I do you know if you look at the prior if you look at the last uh the last chart we did could bounce first right maybe it bounces and and then goes down now what would happen if the dollar bounced right what would happen well or sorry what what would happen if the dollar fell back in I should say like if the dollar uh did something like this where instead where it followed What Bitcoin dominance did where it gets rejected goes back down and then goes up right what if it did something like that like this right now if that were to happen then that could lead to another risk on time in crypto right if the dollar is going down in the same way if you think about it if the dollar is going up it would make makes sense that you think about you sort of a riskof time you think about this move over here by the dollar and how that was very much a riskof time if the dollar were to come back down confirm this double bottom and then break out that could be a risk of time but in the meantime what happens during the phase where it's coming back down well one of the things that we've mentioned with with Bitcoin is that you know actually let's look at it on a lower time frame first so on a lower time frame you can see what's happened so far is that Bitcoin has fallen back in to the bottom part of the range here right so it's been at this range since December 4th and it it's checked in with it now about three or four times and so if this holds right if this holds and Bitcoin moves back up what have we learned over the last year and a half right that we we we said going in if Bitcoin moves up aggressively guess what the dominance of Bitcoin goes up so if if Bitcoin holds here and starts to go back up then the dominance should go up with it if on the other hand we get we confirm a weekly close below the 8we moving average which is currently at you know just over 42k and if we do fall back into the bull market support band it will be very important to see what the reaction is there right what is the reaction if we even go back down there again I I can't promise anything I don't know if we're going to make it back down there or not in the short term I can look back at history and say that every January or February of all prior having years Bitcoin checked in with the bullmark sport band um that doesn't mean that it has to this time uh this is one of those things where you know we can point out the patterns all we want Bitcoin is going to do whatever Bitcoin wants to do um here's an example where it it it tested the bullmark sport band in in q1 of the having year It ultimately fell below it though uh here's another example right here where it tested the bullmark sport band in q1 of the having year and then then again q1 of the having year Bitcoin testing that bull market support ban and so I look at this and say well if Bitcoin does not hold the 8we SMA and falls back into this level I would still argue that the dominance could still go up following that event right because I mean if Bitcoin bounces off of it uh then I imagine dominance would go higher or if in the process of falling maybe altcoins just go down more right there's there is always a chance that that happens as well now there's one thing that you know continues to to be a dilemma in my mind with regards to you know to the idea that that some people have put forth that dominance has you know you know won't go any higher and again I'm not saying they don't have valid arguments I I think a lot of them actually do have valid arguments and I'm not I'm not trying to discredit what they're saying um I'm just trying to provide the other side of the argument right I mean it's a market you know everyone gets things wrong all the time um and so for every person that thinks you know something's going to play out this way there's probably someone else out there that might think the opposite but what I would say what I would say about about dominance and why I'm skeptical of this being um the the end of it and I again I will provide some counterpoints is historically The Ether Bitcoin valuation breaking down after it breaks down that's normally where dominance aggressively makes a turn after ether Bitcoin breaks down if you don't know what I mean let's go take a look at the ether Bitcoin valuation now look at this pattern here you see this pattern it's a pretty clear pattern and um you get a top you set your low and then you put a lower high and then you you keep testing testing that low until you ultimately break through it right so you you keep testing it you eventually break through it and then once it breaks through then ether Bitcoin has found its bottom you know within a couple of months or so right a couple months later if you were to take a a time a date range here from where it broke down to where ether Bitcoin finally found its low was about two months and if you go over here and look at it it was about two months after it broke down about seven or eight weeks or so now when I look at this chart I say all right you get a peak and then a second Peak and then you keep testing the low and yes occasionally we bounced off of that low but history shows that eventually it breaks down you can see that it broke down in late 2016 you can also see that it broke down in mid 2019 and by the way it took a long time to break down I mean it took 82 83 weeks it's been about that long now about 83 weeks weeks or so so we've already exceeded the the amount of time it took compared to last cycle but the point that I would like to make is that in all of these prior cases The Ether Bitcoin pair it put up a fight for a really long time you know it didn't go down without a fight right like the the the the the ether Bitcoin Bulls they fought and they fought and they fought and then eventually they gave up eventually right eventually the the the the Bulls On The Ether Bitcoin pair gave up and ether Bitcoin broke down and I've been very clear about my views on ether Bitcoin my view is that eventually it breaks to the 003 to 004 range I don't know exactly that's just my guess I could be wrong right I I could be wrong and you know anytime I talk about The Ether bit coin pair on on on Twitter or X I get ridiculed right but it's the same people that were ridiculing me when I was talking about how it was in a distribution phase back at the merge you know and so every time it gets any type of a rally off the lows it's sort of like a gotcha moment but is it really you know is it is it really a gotcha moment um or is it just the same pattern that has been playing out in the past where it goes to these lows it bounces but then it still hasn't broken down and so that's one of the reasons why I struggle to to look at dominance definitively and say you know is that the high because I don't I mean I look at ether Bitcoin and I think well what if it still needs to break down and and if ether Bitcoin were to break down and you know to go from the current levels down here that would be another 31 32% drop and if ether Bitcoin drops another 30% well then that's going to send the dominance of Bitcoin through the roof right because it would likely take a lot of altcoins with it so I struggle with that in terms of in terms of identifying you know in terms of being as confident as others on identifying the high on dominance simply because I I look at the chart and I say well ether hasn't broken down yet against Bitcoin so is it possible that it this time is different and we have some type of soft Landing where it doesn't break down I guess that's possible but I I I would also be you know I'd be remiss to Simply say that it it can't break down when it's still following the pattern from prior cycles and if you think about when ether broke down last cycle against Bitcoin it broke down in July now July is interesting because July is when we got our first rate cut in fact July of 2019 if you draw a line down the page again in July of 2019 that is when ether Bitcoin broke down I mean it broke down just a couple of weeks before but it was in that month that ether Bitcoin broke down and we can't know when rate cuts are going to come this cycle we also don't know if it's going to play out the same way that I did last cycle but until we've seen what happens how can we know what if it does play out the same way what if ether Bitcoin doesn't break down until the First Rate cut arrives the problem with that is we don't know when the First Rate cut is going to arrive you know it could be March it could be May in fact right now the market thinks it's not even going to be until May May of 2024 the very beginning of May right May 1 so I think you know there's this idea of well if we get Cuts in March then maybe it breaks down in March if we get Cuts in May then maybe it breaks down in May if you look at the prior pattern over here with ether Bitcoin what you'll notice at least in the last cycle is that there was a low and then a lower low kind of the same thing right here right a low and then a lower low and then it got a bounce and then it did not retest it again for about 22 weeks 22 weeks if you to go out 22 weeks from this bounce right here it would put you in fact in June right in June so that's you know summertime ethereum in terms of seasonality like if you think about like when is ether the weakest it tends to be around May June July right the summer months are often not that kind to ethereum now during the merge that was sort of a different story uh but it still led into you know into you know June or July before then bouncing back up on its Bitcoin pair so if you think about like when has ether Bitcoin found this weakness when has it historically found some weakness often times it is around May or June you could also look at this bounce right here and see how long it took to get back down to the lows and it only took about eight weeks right and if you took out eight weeks from this level it would put it out in March so so I think you could make the case that we could be seeing ether retest the Bitcoin low of 0.049 you know I don't know two between two to four months from now right maybe sooner but you know could be March April May um but sometime in the first half of the year I I think would be kind of an expectation that that ether Bitcoin could come back down and retest this low and if you think about it if we get a rate cut in March then perhaps it's it's like this type of a move right here and you can even see that that Weekly candle right here if you look at the percentage right there that Weekly candle was 17.85% the weekly candle we got last week was about 177% so again it's hard to know if it's going to just immediately fall back down or be like you know what happened over here where it took a lot longer could probably could play out completely different too but I I just want to be like honest like I mean I'm not not here to you know to to say things that I don't think um a lot of people out there are you know give different opinions on it but this is what I'm looking at right what if ether Bitcoin does still eventually break down right what if it still does eventually break down and what if it doesn't occur until May or June potentially at the latest which again would correspond to rate cuts and if it were to break down where do you think Bitcoin dominance goes yes I get it every time I put out this video I get a you know a dozen people saying well what about this person they're saying it's already they're saying it's going to crash this person is saying Bitcoin dominance is going to crash they were saying the same thing a year ago too and two years ago and of course they're going to keep saying the same thing yeah they'll be they'll be right if eventually and maybe they're right now but it's important to recognize that dominance can go up longer than a lot of people think it can and it can also go higher than people think it can if you're honest with yourself there's a lot of people that scoffed at the idea that it would ever even go above 49% remember remember these arguments that that we we had last year where so many people said that you know we were going to have alt season right here and and the Bitcoin dominance was going to get rejected and go back down well that didn't happen you know it broke out and it's true we have fallen below the bull market support bin so why don't we pivot to that now and see what's going on there throughout all of 2023 Bitcoin dominance did not have a single weekly close below the bull market support band right you can see that it stayed above it every single time it tested it there was one WI below it but every single time it would test it it would bounce right here's another Wick we finally got a weekly close below the bull market support ban in January of 2024 so this month so then does that mean the trend is over right and I think it's a fair question right so I don't think it's it's it's not like it's obvious that it has to go up anymore right it's not um this prior trend of holding the 20we SMA Andor 21 we EMA it has been broken right it has been so we could go back to last cycle and see you know did that happen at all and there are some examples I mean there's there's this example right here where you can see that Bitcoin Dominus was above the 20we es for a long time it finally broke down and when it broke down it actually broke down in De like late 2018 early 2019 right it broke below so right around the turn of the year it broke down and then it stayed below that until April April what's fascinating about that what's fascinating about April is that that's when the Bitcoin having is and it's also potentially around the time of rate Cuts plus or minus a month or so right like maybe we get a rate cut in March maybe we get one in May but what happens if dominance starts to go back up again sometime around the having and I don't mean like you know back up to 52% right if it goes back to 52% no one's going to care you know I mean it could easily bounce around these levels for a long time and it and it hasn't if it hasn't taken out these this High over here didn't really matter right so until it actually breaks out doesn't really matter if it gets any types of bounces but the point that I'm trying to make is that it got below the bull Mark Spen right here faded I mean it went back up right but then it faded still until April till the very beginning of April and then it broke up the reason I I think that is an interesting observation is because this breaking up occurs potentially if it were to happen in April again about one month before the First Rate cut if the First Rate cut occurs in May maybe it occurs in March and then this timeline has accelerated but remember what we said about ether Bitcoin how it could break down in in the in sometime in the first half of the year you know Pro I mean maybe February but likely I mean when when you get a move this aggressive um you know it would it would likely take you know many weeks for it to fade back down so you know earliest could be March um all the way out through the first half of the year it's just I mean and again like you might say well you want something more specific guys the hard part about all this is that the market really doesn't know when the First Rate cut is coming because the market doesn't know how much longer the economy can hold on you know it's always possible that the First Rate cut doesn't occur until even later in the year right but when you look at dominance here it made another move starting in April now look at this let's overlay interest rates on here I'm going to change the color do you see where dominance finally topped we at the top after rate Cuts began right it was after rate Cuts began and this move here started right this move started before rate Cuts began right it started in in April started before the First Rate cut arrived and so what if something similar plays out you know maybe it doesn't even take until April for it to start to make its move maybe it starts to make a move in in March or even February so that I think is is something to you know to to keep in mind now remember there's there's all sorts of things we can look at with Bitcoin USD right like there's the uh there's the bullmark tban there's the 8we ese we haven't tested those yet and I I frankly I mean I I think there's a case be made that we could test them in in the first couple of months of this year like we normally do but if we don't test them and Bitcoin just breaks out again where do you think think dominance is going to go remember historically when ether Bitcoin broke down in Prior in Prior moves right when it when it broke down over here it was on a Bitcoin rally right it was on a Bitcoin rally when ether Bitcoin broke down over here in late 2016 it was on a Bitcoin rally and then Bitcoin topped out last cycle one month before rate Cuts began right so last cycle when Bitcoin had this impressive move um you know all the way up to to 14K or so you can see that that sort of preceded the First Rate cut now I'll be honest I mean this Wick looks kind of scary and and it could be similar to that Wick but even if even if this is the high for a while it doesn't mean you can't come back up and and test it I mean you can see even in in last cycle we did go back up and test it and if it and if we take out that high right if we take out that high then I have to imagine that dominance would go up I have to imagine that that dominance would go up in that type of scenario so let's suppose first of all let's suppose Bitcoin breaks down to either the you know to the bullmark sportan or the 100 we SMA if it were to do that and then bounce back up aggressively then that could be where ether Bitcoin finally breaks down if it doesn't go back down to those levels and then just goes goes back up then it could break down a lot sooner and then maybe you accelerate the timeline instead of being like May or June where it breaks down perhaps it breaks down earlier like March or something um so it's an interesting sort of an interesting idea that I know a lot of people are sort of celebrating this Bounce by Ether but we said that it could bounce right I mean like we said that look guys it could bounce and if it does it still has a lot to prove because if you think about it it still hasn't managed to to take out a lot of a lot of these major Milestones like look at this look at look at it like this this is the 50e estimate right I mean last cycle it it bounced up near it and then still faded back to the downside right it still faded back down so I find it challenging to with confidence say that the highs are in for dominance when I still think there is a reasonable chance that the ether Bitcoin valuation could break down that's my view right I I I think there's a a case to be made that ether Bitcoin could break down now one thing that I will remind people of somewhat regret ably to be completely honest somewhat regrettably that I'll even say this because it it it it only it only ever leads to to people mocking me but I I will say it just because it is in my opinion it's important um no matter what the haters want to say but if we look at at what happened to Ether USD if you look at what happened to Ether USD after ether Bitcoin broke down right so let's um let me change this so look at these prior moves do you see here where ether Bitcoin finally broke down in October of 2016 what happened after it broke down ether USD collapsed what happened when ether Bitcoin broke down here in 2019 ether USD collapsed and what's interesting is from this high here to the low ether dropped about 70% after you know around the time that ether Bitcoin broke down is about a 70% drop and then if you look at the last cycle a you know you can see here ether Bitcoin broke down how far did ether USD fall was about a 70% drop I mean even if you exclude the pandemic and you just take it right there it's about a 70% drop now I don't know where the high is for ethereum this year I have no idea but what's interesting is this drop right here Let's ignore this this this uh sort of when it started and just take it from say like the wick right here maybe not even the wick like take it from just that Weekly open that's about a 70% drop now do you want all three of these 70% drops by Ether USD have in common it's that they all terminated at the lower part of the logarithmic regression ban right one two 3 now I don't know where ether USD tops it's possible that already has if Bitcoin goes up again and puts in a new high or even if it even if Bitcoin were to go back up to you know the prior high it's possible that ether could go you know go put a new high but what would it take to go back down to the regression band down here well this was a 70% drop this was a 70% drop this was a 70% drop do you think before any of those 70% drops people were screaming hey it's about to drop 70% probably not but we don't really have a lot of data for this first one because the ether Bitcoin pair just sort of was that was where it was created but I mean kind of Imagine right that it broke imagine that ether Bitcoin just broke down right here ether USD dropped 70% ether Bitcoin dropped here from this Wick at least ether USD dropped 70% ether Bitcoin broke down here ether USD dropped 70% so then I guess the question is is well will it do the same thing again I don't know but I will say and you know this is where I get in trouble because like if if Bitcoin were to rally for the next you know let's say Bitcoin just kind of does nothing for the next like four weeks um just kind of stays in the range that it's been in for a while and let's suppose that sometime around the having we get another another move by Bitcoin it would likely drag eth with it okay but imagine that you know where I don't I don't know how high you'd have to go for a 70% drop to be at the bottom of the regression band right so and and it depends on when as as well right I mean if let's just say in May let's say in May then the bottom of the regression band will be you know probably around 700 800 um this would put ether USD that 70% top would be around 2700 2,800 you know maybe plus or minus a couple hundred dollar right so I I just think it's interesting because um that could correspond to Ether Bitcoin breaking down right it could correspond ether Bitcoin breaking down and what's more interesting if you look at ether USD or if you look at it here it's actually still forming that same pattern right where it's it's putting in these highs and then putting in these higher lows or higher highs and higher lows it then breaks out but then eventually it breaks back down you can see a very similar pattern over here right like it's putting in these slightly higher highs uh higher lows it's starting to break out here you can already argue that it has broken out look how long it took over here before it broke down right it took about 3 months or so right so three months from now puts it in April right why is April important that's right around the time that rate Cuts might arrive it could occur in March it could occur in May but let's suppose that rate Cuts arrive and then let's suppose that whatever ethereum's valuation is at you know on its US dollar pair what if it starts to drop then as Bitcoin finally breaks it off support so that's the important thing is that remember Bitcoin rallies break all Bitcoin pairs down right so if Bitcoin were to get another rally at some point in the next two to three months then there's a good chance they could bring ether Bitcoin back down to these PRI LS now I get that everyone's talking about The Ether ETF and I'm not trying to Discount that I don't know exactly where that's going to end up but um if you think about it even if the ether ETF does get approved sometime in the next few months look at what happened with bitcoin's ETF once it got approved I mean it dropped Bitcoin immediately dropped um almost 20% right so yeah I mean that that's the thing is that yes people are going to continue to chase The Narrative of of The Ether ETF and so for you know for several more months that could be the narrative that is sort of entrenched in our minds of the of The Ether ETF but my my point is that once that narrative has come and gone right once it has come and gone does ether Bitcoin finally just break down you know once there's no longer another narrative to cling to right you already got the merge you got all these ETFs right the Bitcoin havs behind us then does ether Bitcoin finally break down and remember historically Ally when it breaks down it's on a Bitcoin rally right um so it could be a rally it could be a rally that Bitcoin gets after it bounces off the 100 we SMA it could be a rally that gets off off the bullmark SP band or it could be a rally to a new higher high right it could be a rally to a new higher high where it takes out the prior high and we've talked about there's some evidence to suggest this could be a a significant local top for a little while um especially given all the hype that came with it and and they're being sort of these these spot ETFs and so I think that's a relevant thing to think about like if that is the top then a future rally by Bitcoin could put in a lower high but it could still break ether Bitcoin down and if Bitcoin puts in a higher high then I imagine ether Bitcoin could still break down so when I look at all that I think well kind of seems like dominance could still go up now if you were to look at dominance really closely here let's look at it like this you can see that this level right here right this level right here is actually the very similar level that this Wick came back down to in 2018 right so you know my interpretation is that Bitcoin is the dominance is is getting is hardening hardening up right yes there's been a lot of selling pressure pressure through you know through um gbtc we know that but despite all that selling pressure dominance is still staying above the prior breakout zone right of 49% so if you were to ask me like what is an invalidation right like where would I just say all right throw the towel on it look if it breaks back down below 49 like if it breaks back down below here right this area that it took forever to break out above if we get back back down here then yes yes you know it would be time to to you know to probably throw in the towel okay but as long as we're up here I don't I I I can't really come up with a compelling reason why you know we have to I have to throw in the towel now on it because again you know after it broke out of this range after it broke out of this range it still took it from this breakout here until the next uptrend until the next move really started it took 34 weeks right so from here to where we currently are we're currently at 32 weeks so what if we're just in some type of consolidation right that is not that dissimilar from what we saw over here where if you look you can see that Bitcoin dominance was also in a downtrend channel right it was putting in lower highs and lower lows which is kind of similar to to what's happening again right now in the short term where it's in this downtrend channel um but it could still eventually break back up to the upside just like it did right here right and so you know what if it just continues to do that where it just bounces around and then by you know March or April or something or maybe even sooner it just blasts off through here and dominance breaks up again right at the same time that ether Bitcoin it finally breaks down right remember ether Bitcoin finally broke down after you know right around the time that rate Cuts arrived and again we're we're probably looking at a rate cut in either March or may either March or May so that's why I think you know it's worthwhile to be a little bit flexible on this and say all right well maybe it comes back down in March maybe it takes all the way out until late May or something to to fade back down but my guess is that it does eventually fade back down and then once all the ETF narrative is behind us then I I suppose that it finally breaks down if you were to look at say like total three minus USD out of a Bitcoin I get that you know a lot of people are hopeful that it doesn't break down but you know from setting this Wick here until breaking down it took about you know 4 one weeks SL 42 weeks or so here you know we're currently only on week 30 you know if you were to take it out to 42 weeks guess where that puts you it puts you in April which is the having right and again that's April is is is smack dab between the two most likely candidate months for a rate cut could be March could be May so I just want people to be aware that yes a lot of altcoins have held their own against Bitcoin since July as you can see that total three minus usct Bitcoin has not broken durably below that low but last cycle we can see that it also took about 42 weeks before it broke down and by the way it did not break down until about a month before the First Rate cut arrived so perhaps it will do something similar where it breaks down you can see right here it broke down right as that first r cut arrived if the First Rate cut occurs in March then maybe it breaks down in March if the First Rate cut arrives in May then maybe it breaks down in May I think I look I think one of the issues is that it it's such an exhausting process right to look at this stuff because I think like a lot of people can like look at it and and say yeah like it makes sense but it's kind of a long time to just simply wait right and so I that's what I've said before guys have a plan right like do what you want to do I mean you know if there's stuff you want in your portfolio you can always just DCA into that stuff and just say all right I acknowledge that perhaps Bitcoin will outperform it and I acknowledge that maybe it'll play out like this but if there's something you really want you can say all right I know this is probably going to happen or if it repeats last cycle then it could happen but I'm just going to DCA It Anyways okay you can always come up with that and just tune me out I think that's a valid strategy to be completely honest right I'm not asking you to sit here every single week and watch to see if alts are going to break down against Bitcoin or not but you know I I feel like I have a responsibility to continue to follow up on this since it's been a thesis that we've talked about for a long time will they will they eventually break down against Bitcoin or not and you know there's a lot of people that are saying well the narrative is Shifting now it's shifting away from Bitcoin and towards altcoins and towards ethereum because of the ether ETF and while that may be true I'm not trying to say that there's no narrative shift at all there clearly has been because ether Bitcoin is now 06 and it was at 05 there's also the the having for Bitcoin in April so you know what if the narrative just shifts back to that like if you think about like again if you look at at like The Ether Bitcoin pair right if you look at at The Ether Bitcoin pair and you think about last cycle you know it's not like there were no narrative shifts in here right when it rallied when The Ether Bitcoin pair rallied back up from the low s almost 70% and then again it rallied off that low 40% yes there were narrative shifts but it still eventually broke down and so what if you know it does the same thing I mean I'm not saying it can't go any higher but what if eventually you know we get closer to the habing people start to think well yes The Ether ETF may be coming but also there's the Bitcoin having that's coming and so a lot of that Capital that left Bitcoin to go to Ether might just come right back right it might just go right back to bitcoin and perhaps such a move would correspond to the dollar getting rejected off the bull market sport band only to then come back down and set in a double bottom and then go up right so imagine if it were to play out like Bitcoin dominance did where it it came down right if we were we remember we talking about this earlier where Bitcoin dominance it it it had this same type of long-term accumulation pattern right a low a lower low a lower low you finally take out some of these prior highs and then you set a double bottom after getting rejected off the bullmark sport pin what if during this period right here if it if like Bitcoin dominance got rejected for a couple of months what if the dollar does the same thing do during that period if we go back to risk on and Bitcoin goes back up and then ether Bitcoin finally breaks down then Bitcoin would likely be able to roll over and then there's nowhere for ether to hide because it finally broke down on its Bitcoin pair what are some counterpoints to this stuff because this is all great you know but there's got to be valid arguments the other way and I I think there are one of the one of the things that we've mentioned is is the dominance um uh if you were to look at at year-to dat Roi of dominance I think that's a good way to look at it dominance without stable coins more specifically here's 2024 and then here's 2020 and here's 2016 so you can see that there's a case to be made that maybe dominance doesn't do what I just said and maybe it just kind of you know oscillates around for the entire year where it goes a little it goes lower but then maybe just goes right back up you know by the end of the year so you could have a scenario like that where it just sort of moves around like this and doesn't get that breakout that you know that I just mentioned um there are some counterpoints to that because as we know the year-to DAT stuff does not always play out take a look at what happened in 2023 and look at 2019 and look at 2015 they're all pretty similar years right 2015 2019 and 2023 in fact 2023 played out really similar to to 2015 in terms of where it actually ended the year but if you look at 2022 compared to 2018 2018 Bitcoin dominance went up a lot more than it did in 2022 so the argument that I'm trying to make is what if this Gap here right that the fact that dominant State and guys this excludes stable coins a lot of times people say well the market is different now we have stable coins this is excluding the stable coin market right it's excluding the stable coin market and we've been showing this chart forever excluding the stable coin Market what if we have to still make that move because ether Bitcoin still needs to break down because last cycle it broke down in 2019 in the prehab year but also last cycle rate Cuts occurred in the prehab year what if this cycle rate Cuts occur in the having year and that's where ether Bitcoin finally breaks down so perhaps we're sort of in out you know the 2024 Trend with the 2022 Trend or something where normally the dominance would have gone up more in the bare Market year but it didn't and so then for therefore it goes up more in in the having year just one way to think about it right I'm not saying it has to play out like that but it is something to think about there are some other valid counterpoints I think so like if you were to look at like Bitcoin dominance uh plus let's say usdt dominance plus um usdc dominance look at this chart let's imagine unfortunately we just don't have a lot of data before here because um you know just trading view doesn't have the history for that for the usdc stable coin uh beyond that um you only can you only can look to see like you know when since when the since when the newest asset has been around or since when trading view has data for it but if you look at it like this right if you look at it like this where are we now right here what's interesting about this level right here well let's draw a line across the page and see the last time we were at this level after breaking above it in the last cycle okay it was right here now draw a line from this Wick here over here now look at this this Wick here sort of matches up up with this one and then this these lows here on on bitcoin dominance plus usdt dominance plus usdc dominance they came off it fell back in to about 58% which is exactly where it is now right exactly where it is now and then look what happened after it spent about a month at these levels starting in June of 2019 it absolutely blasted off to the high part of the range it blasts it off why did it go up so much what happened in June of 2019 well that was again one month before rate Cuts arrived one month before rate Cuts right so it came down and then blast it off and when it finally made that move it broke all Bitcoin pairs down but it kept going up why did it keep going up is because the dominance of stable coins were was going up because people were selling their crypto right they were selling their crypto look at um usdt dominance on this chart you can see that USD dominance was going up during that time right it was going up and that also you know helped this whole chart go back to the upside now you might say well let me let me remove let me let me draw pull it up on a different thing okay so now let's look at just Bitcoin dominance plus usct dominance because you might you might look at the um at the prior chart and say well you know what happens if it you know it's not an oscillator the thing is is like you know last cycle if you just look at dominance of Bitcoin plus usct dominance you could make the case you know somewhat I suppose um it only went a little bit lower over here than it did over here what if it's you know what if we're just simply in this phase right what if we're just in this phase right here where eventually it still breaks to the upside right where it still breaks to the upside it's possible another way to look at this by the way is to look at usdt dominance by itself this is kind of a scary chart um so there's two ways to look at it there's an optimistic way and a very pessimistic way we'll start with the optimistic way this is the optimistic way to look at it why is this the optimistic way well if you look at usdt dominance every time it hits this trend line it is a cur it's corresponded to major pullbacks in crypto if you don't believe me let's take a um is there a well let's just go look November of 2021 I don't have to tell you what was going on you know what was going on in crypto in November of 2021 right November of 2021 right here that was just before a larger pullback began here this was March April May of 2021 just before a major pullback occurred here February 2020 just before the March 20 20 crash right here July of 2019 just before Bitcoin topped out or no just after Bitcoin topped out right now let's overlay Bitcoin USD onto the chart you can see what I'm talking about right when it hits this trend line it's not a good thing so that would suggest that maybe just maybe there's still some more room in the tank for this to go for USD dominance to go down before it then goes back up that's the optimistic way to look at it right and again I'm not saying it could play out like that we've made the case that if the dollar gets a pullback and we know that ether has not yet broken down against Bitcoin perhaps there's reason to believe that Bitcoin could get another push into the having and tether dominance goes down again the reason why it's a little iffy and not set in stone is because while this looks really really clear you could also put this on a log chart I'm not really sure how much it makes sense because it is a percentage but if you were to put on a log chart it tells a slightly different story and that story is that we're already there right if you look at it on like a a log chart and you connect the dots you could say that we're already at this level right we're already at the um the levels that you know when previously this trend line hit was not a good thing okay so probably makes more sense to look at it on the regular axis to be completely honest but just for the sake of completeness I wanted to show it here the other thing that I think is worth mentioning is if you look at the Fib retracement from this level here and you compare it to last cycle what you'll notice is that Bitcoin had it did not have its re it did not have the larger pullback until after Bitcoin dominance had retraced all the way back up to the 0. five FIB the 0.5 right I need to switch this to a regular scale um so here you can see that Bitcoin USD was still chopping around up here and it did not finally begin the the the trend back down until after dominance broke through the 0.5 FIB the 0.5 FIB this cycle is about 56% we haven't hit 56% yet but what if we do what if you know at some point between now and the having the dollar pulls back Bitcoin gets another move dominance goes to 56% I don't know if it'll be a lower high for Bitcoin USD or if it will be a higher high what I do think needs to happen during whatever move comes I think ether Bitcoin is going to break down okay so whether Bitcoin puts in a lower High um or a higher high I think ether Bitcoin will probably break down you might say well you know last time what made ether Bitcoin breakdown was it a higher high or was a lower high well it depends on which time you look there's two examples and in both cases we basically have uh a different something different that happened right if you look in 2019 ether Bitcoin you might be surprised to know this but ether Bitcoin over here broke down the week of July 8th July 8th was this week that was right here that was a lower high right it was a lower high because Bitcoin put in its high the week of June 24th but then it put in a lower high the week of July 8th but on the week of July 8th ether Bitcoin broke down even though Bitcoin was not putting in a new high it still broke down but if you go back to the cycle before that if you go back over here and you look at ether Bitcoin um right here you can see that it broke down in late October 2016 early November well late October early November Bitcoin was actually still at a at a lower high in fact but it ended up becoming a higher high right but in both cases ether Bitcoin broke down at lower highs one case Bitcoin went on to go to a higher high the other case Bitcoin just put in a lower high and went back down as rate Cuts were were ushered in so that's another thing to think about you know um and again as I've said before right like it's not that you can't make money on eth right I mean I know everyone everyone and their mom is now chasing the E ETF narrative okay but my point is that ether is staying elevated because of Bitcoin and not the other way around right it's not ethereum is not the one holding up the market it has been Bitcoin that has been holding up the market for a long time now sure you can point to the last couple of weeks and say well you know this has been one hell of a move by Ether so what you know it still is down it still has been an a macro downtrend against Bitcoin since the merge which is when I said this was a secondary distribution phase just like Bitcoin USD and a lot of people did not want to listen to that when I said that was a secondary distribution phase and since that time ether Bitcoin has f and even to the current levels 30% right I can't tell you how many videos I've made over the last couple years talking about every single one of these lower highs I mean every single one and every single time you know it bounces everyone loves to come out and say you know well look at that but it still eventually just faded back down you may say well eventually it's going to break back up and it won't fade back down I agree with you I really do I I do I'm not a Bitcoin Maxi even though I do sometimes seem like I'm one on here but I just think that it's going to break down before we can say that right I think we need to go down to this level here so perhaps that's what happens right where just sort of slowly Fades back down um maybe it doesn't take that long but where it just sort of slowly Fades back down into here and then some down somewhere over here at bottoms and then it and then we just go on another type of move I could see that happening it's a way to way to think that it could could eventually go we could also understand some of Bitcoin dominance through alt coins again right like you could look at at like the Ada Bitcoin pair and see that it's kind of doing something very similar to the last cycle it did right where it found a low it found this low here right and then after finding that low it then bounced back up to this high and now it's starting to fade back down look at this High when did this High occur April of 2019 May June July three months before the First Rate cut this occurred in December January February March maybe we'll get a rate cut in March so the qu or maybe it'll take until May I don't know but I I think the thing to look for is Ada Bitcoin doing the same thing it did last cycle where everyone just joins in thinking the hype's going to last forever and then it still just ends up being a lower high and a to bitcoin Fades back down and still eventually breaks down right that's what happened last cycle right again it put in these highs after after going down to 800 SATs it went all the way back up to you know to almost 2,000 STS very similar move over here and then faded back down and eventually broke one thing that could be a warning sign for ether Bitcoin could be if alt breakdown because if you look at alt USD PA or all Bitcoin pairs last cycle they actually broke down um I think maybe like slightly before ether Bitcoin broke down so if you were to zoom in they broke down the week of June 24th right ether Bitcoin didn't break down until 2 weeks later so it could be that if you see all Bitcoin pairs breaking down that could be a warning sign for ether that it's going to break down too okay um and look at this look at this move here right it's a very similar move you go to this low right you put in a low you retest it same thing over here and then you bounce up to this High same thing right here and then perhaps it just slowly Fades back down and it and it potentially breaks right around the time of rate Cuts right which means you know it could still stay elevated for a couple a few more months but still think eventually it'll likely break down remember over here when it broke down it was on a Bitcoin rally right it was on a Bitcoin rally so those are my thoughts on uh on bitcoin dominance and we've we've thrown in some counter points I've said look if it if it goes below if it goes below the breakout Zone here then I would concede you know that it won't that it likely isn't going to 60% but as long as we stay above the breakout Zone just like we did just like we stayed above it over here as long as we stay above that and you can even see it's almost an identical pattern look at this look you break out right here right there and then after breaking out you retest it let me see if I can show you so look you break out right here and then you retest it you break out right here and then you retest it but then you eventually put in this High which is like this high right here and then you put in a lower high which maybe is this lower high right here but ideally it puts in a macro higher low where somewhere over here you know it it finds a higher low and rather than rather than going back down to this level it just blasts off so look guys I don't know what's going to happen the next few weeks um I imagine that if dominance were to go back below 50% or below 51% let's say it goes back down to 50.5 I know a lot of people are going to be wondering what's going on but just know as long as it's above the breakout point from last you know from from earlier then it's potentially doing what it did in the last cycle right I know there's a lot of people that that think that Bitcoin dominance doesn't matter anymore because of the stable coin Market but again what were their views on dominance a year ago right all I saw a year ago was alt season calls alt season is this this is alt season where dominance is cratering by like you know 20 or 30% right that's alt season no one in the future is going to look at this move by dominance and say oh look at that all season no this has been Bitcoin season was not it's not been alt season alt season is where dominance is going down very very quickly and I just I don't I'm not saying it can't slowly fade until we have a sufficient reason to bounce like we did over here in April of 2019 what I'm saying is that at some point I think there's going to come a time within the next few months where it's going to get a massive bounce out of this range and guess what will happen if that happens then people will call the top on it again but again I mean like you know it's possible that 55% is the high but I hope that I've provided some compelling evidence for you to think about that might show why it could be premature to assume that that is the the the main outcome there are reasons to think that Bitcoin dominance could break out again hopefully I provided that in this video If you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the crypts premium at into the crypto.com I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-01-19 00:00:00,"The video discusses the potential for Bitcoin dominance to rise higher than the current 55% level, despite some arguments that 55% could be the top. The host examines the relationship between Bitcoin dominance and the US dollar index, noting potential parallels in their patterns that could signal further upside for Bitcoin dominance.The host also highlights the importance of the Ethereum-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair breaking down, as this has historically coincided with increases in Bitcoin dominance. The host presents a bullish case, suggesting dominance could rise further if ETH/BTC breaks down and Bitcoin holds key support levels. This is based on historical precedent, where ETH/BTC breaking down has led to significant drops in the Ethereum USD price, with those drops terminating near the lower end of the logarithmic regression band.The host acknowledges valid arguments for a Bitcoin dominance top, but suggests that if Bitcoin rallies and drags Ethereum higher, a subsequent breakdown in ETH/BTC could occur, potentially around the time of the Bitcoin halving and potential interest rate cuts. This could correspond with a rise in Bitcoin dominance, as has happened in previous cycles.The host also examines the behavior of Tether (USDT) dominance, which has tended to spike prior to major crypto market pullbacks, suggesting the potential for more downside in altcoin dominance before an eventual recovery. Additionally, the host looks at the Cardano-Bitcoin (ADA/BTC) pair, noting a similar pattern to the previous cycle, where ADA/BTC found a low, bounced, and is now starting to fade back down, potentially signaling a warning sign for Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin.Overall, the sentiment is cautiously bullish, with the host leaving open the possibility of Bitcoin dominance moving higher, especially if certain technical conditions are met, such as a breakdown in the ETH/BTC pair and Bitcoin holding critical support levels. The host also suggests that a breakdown in altcoin Bitcoin pairs could be a leading indicator for a potential breakdown in the ETH/BTC pair.",407,"[0.03225708, -0.019134521, 0.027572632, 0.013191223,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and I want to go over a pattern that has emerged often in the early phase of the having year if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom let's go and jump in you guys may remember in Q3 of the pre we having year we talked about that Bitcoin would likely go below its bull market support ban so remember that here we speculated dubiously of course that Bitcoin would likely Fall below it namely because every prior Q3 of preh having years we have fallen below the bull market sport band and so it seemed like there was a good chance that we would do so again and we did you know and I I remember back then a lot of people really discounted that idea um and but again the same pattern ultimately emerged and we fell below it now there's a similar thing that you could look towards again and that's in about February of the having year we've seen a pattern emerge and that is that it Bitcoin has always been at its bullmark and support ban in February of the having year okay I'm not saying below it I'm not saying well above it I'm saying in February of the having year Bitcoin has always tagged the bull market support band that is this band right here now from the current levels that would represent a substantial drop about a 15% drop which isn't that much all things considered if you were actually look at every every time Bitcoin had a daily close below the 50-day moving average um you know just over just over the last year or so every time we've had moves below that 50-day SMA we ended up dropping you know 11% there uh 12 133% right there about 14 15% there so I mean a 15 15% drop would get you to the bullmark wor end but again if it takes until February to get there the bullmark wor Bend could be higher you know it could be at like 37 or it's already at the 21 m is already at 37k but it could be even higher it could be like 38k or something but to sort of show you what I mean if you were to go back and look at prea or sorry at at having years you will see that in February of 2020 we found ourselves at the bull market sport band you will also see see that in February of 2016 we found ourselves at the bull market sport fan and then finally you will see that in February of 2012 Bitcoin fell to the bull market support ban so this is another case where you have three prior instances where Bitcoin had a rally and then going into February so going into February it dropped to the bull market support band so it it's curious if the same thing will play out again whether Bitcoin will get that get that drop to the bullmark sport bin which is about a 15% drop from the current price you know if you give it a couple more weeks the bullmark sport bin will be slightly higher and therefore it it could be a a smaller drop but I did want to at least point that out now note that in the case of 2012 and in the case of 2016 we held it as support but in the case of 2020 we did not hold it as support we had the pandemic drop right we ended up having a recession where the unemployment rate went up a lot so remember if the economy holds up then we might bounce off of that level if the economy does not hold up and the FED has pushed us into a recession then it might not hold up you could always have an example where you go back down to it and then bounce only to then later test it again because I mean a lot of these moves that's what happens right I mean even in even in 2016 right you we went up to it we went down to it in February and then we bounced in in March and then we're back you know testing it throughout all of March and April before Mo moving up in May um so just something you know just something to think about but anyways I I think we'll keep it short today I just wanted to point out that pattern we'll see if it plays out again or not if it does it would it would mean Bitcoin falling below uh where you know below the this current range and dropping back to the bullmark sport band sometime in in you know going into into February and and seeing it around the 20we ese Andor 21 we EMA sometime in February if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-01-16 00:00:00,"The video discusses a pattern that has emerged in the early phase of the Bitcoin halving year, where Bitcoin has historically dropped to its bull market support band in February. The speaker notes that this has occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and suggests that a similar drop of around 15% could happen again this year, potentially bringing Bitcoin to the 21-week or 20-week exponential moving average. The speaker acknowledges that the outcome may depend on the state of the economy, as in 2020 the support level did not hold due to the pandemic-induced recession. The overall sentiment is cautiously bearish, as the speaker highlights the potential for a significant short-term drop, while also acknowledging the possibility of a bounce-back scenario. The main message is that Bitcoin may experience a substantial dip in February, potentially reaching its bull market support band, which could serve as a buying opportunity or a concerning signal depending on the broader economic conditions.",192,"[0.024856567, 0.0024051666, -0.020263672, -0.0064697266, -0.003435135, -0.025634766, 0.016311646, -0.031097412, 0.052612305, 0.019134521,

happy Monday everybody we are back here Ben Cowen and I are back with the no shill Zone on this Monday at 11 a.m. hope everyone's doing well um first off Ben uh give us a rundown of everything from last week to this week right so we had the spot ETF approval Bitcoin spiked to 49,000 and now it's reversed back down to what is it at 42,000 and change I mean what are what's your takeaway from the approval was it a success I mean look long term long term there's no doubt that it's going to lead to more flows into into the asset class right but in the short term it was a sell the news event um that doesn't mean that it you know can't pop back up but I mean we did at least come off what about six or seven ,000 since that time there was uh there was something that I I think we were talking about previously and that was this chart right here this is the number of days since Bitcoin had a 10% decline I don't know if the viewers remember this chart but sure enough just when we always think that we can't get a drop Bitcoin finally got a a 10% drop uh as measured from the daily closes on about you know day 149 and you can see that we don't normally go too much higher than that before you get a pullback so pretty I mean pretty standard stuff at this point um I don't I don't think it's you know out of left field it's it's more or less what we've seen in terms of in terms of these pullbacks in terms of of Bitcoin I think the more the more interesting thing is is kind of what's happened with the altcoin market with respect to bitcoin I know we've talked about Bitcoin dominance obviously ethereum has had a bit of a a bit of a move recently so maybe maybe it would be worthwhile to talk a little bit more about about that and and how the altcoin market I know you've been more so playing the altcoin market than I have over the last couple of months yeah yeah and that's a good point I mean definitely definitely like you mentioned ethereum kind of perked up uh right as soon as in fact basically when the ETF actually when that fake rumor hit that was the first kind of uptick in ethereum that we saw and then the next day it kind of continued its rally all the way up to about 27,000 uh I can bring up my chart here and you can see that we did hit this upper band on ethereum right so so again you know if you look back and look and say okay well where's the Confluence of levels there was a level here at around 27 100 and then also look at the parallel lines that we were stuck in we had pierced it once over here and if you do a parallel it gives you the exact high right there so just kind of cool stuff like that before we jump into some of these other altcoins um I would love to just show one thing that's caught my eye on bitcoin so I think the first thing is it we're only trading even like you said a 10% correction we're only back to where we were about what 10 12 days ago so so it's not like yes it was a 10% correction but it's not like oh my gosh you know bitcoin's crashing it's not crashing at this point the one thing I am watching though is this little UPS sloping trend line in purple right here kind of connecting through this low and this low and this low and this low we pierced it on that reversal day we're now beginning to kind of trade a little bit at or below that line and I do think that at least according to what I'm seeing is if we do see a break down here you probably do head to 38,000 which again is not that much further down right I mean it's about 4 ,000 down a little less than another 10% move from here uh reason why is not only is the the level here if you look pivot High pivot High pivot high so we kind of were batting against this level it's 38,000 level and then we broke out so support or or in this case this was resistance once it's broken it becomes support and then one other little tidb that I like to show here is if we throw the 100 day moving average in there that's also that level as well so in terms of would I think that Bitcoin could gain support if it hits 38,000 yes and I even think it could bounce off off of that level the only potential like bigger negative I see is the fact that yesterday we closed the weekly with a topping tail topping tails are reversal signals um so we have a weekly topping tail now on bitcoin and again if you look at Bitcoin or any asset class topping tailes often can Mark a longer term high like not just a one or two week high but it could be a multi-month high in Bitcoin and then in fact the monthly as well we obviously still have a lot of time left this month but current it would also be a topping Tail as well so little things like that you know it doesn't give us any any 100% right it's all probabilities but it's just things that as a technician I pay attention to on the charts of Bitcoin um going to some of the altcoins I'd love to hear kind of like what are you thinking on salana here like is is is this going to break down is it making a bullish consolidation pattern I mean where are your thoughts on these altcoins at this point I mean like I think collectively my view on altcoins is that collectively they will remain weak against Bitcoin until we go back to to QE I get like you know the last couple of weeks it's been different in terms of in terms of the dominance going down um but before I go too far into that the the other thing I me I wanted to mention is because you brought up the 100 day moving average for Bitcoin we actually just got the first daily close below the 50-day right and the only reason I think that's relevant is you can see that you know throughout this entire rally every time we've gotten a close below the 50-day we then proceeded to go back down about another 13 % or 15% so I mean if we were to do something like that a 13 133% move gets you down to about 37k which is kind that ballpark of of what you were mentioning um and also right around that that 20we SMA 21 we EMA because those are you know the 21 we EMA is at 37k right but as as far as as far as the altcoin market goes I think this is is what I'm looking at so I think about ethereum as sort of like the index for the altcoin market um and basically the idea is if you have an altcoin that can't outperform ethereum then what are you doing you know I mean ethereum is lower risk than a lot of altcoins but there's this pattern that I've you know I've talked about a long time and I I think it's probably playing out again and it's this idea of you know ethereum loves setting in sort of these higher lows for a while but there is an issue that potentially emerges where it it sometimes you know it will eventually likely break down and it's hard to of course know exactly when that time frame is but I I think there's some some data we can look at sort of discuss that is are we going to see the same thing play out right like where it it has the last couple of Cycles or so but the thing that's really interesting is to note why ether USD finally broke down during these um you know during this move right here in in late 2016 and in and in September 2019 and and potentially sometime in the next couple of months and the reason is if you look at eth Bitcoin you can see that The Ether Bitcoin pair look where it broke down right here finally below see I mean this this pattern is the same thing right a high a lower high yeah I mean it just keeps emerging right you get a high a lower high a high a lower high you get a bounce you put in your Wick right there put in your Wick put in your Wick you you get your second High you come back down to it and then you get a bounce we've we've seen that a couple of times now but the issue is that ethereum tends to then eventually break down on on his Bitcoin pair where it goes you know maybe 20 30 40% below below that low right so I still think that needs to happen well nothing needs to happen right it's a market all all things could happen but if you look at at at where it broke down where ether Bitcoin broke down in 2016 it was in October and where did ethusd finally break down here it was October of 2016 right right when ether Bitcoin did if you go look at the next cycle where did ether Bitcoin break down it was in July of 2019 where did ether USD finally break the low break this trend line July August of 2019 right so for me when I think about the altcoin market I I think that okay well they're more or less likely going to follow the health of ethereum and I'm not saying ethereum can't go up I mean like if Bitcoin bounces anywhere from here even if it goes back down to the bullmark support and then bounces then it could still lead ethereum higher the problem is I still think maybe I'm too stubborn about it uh but I I still think there is a case to be made that ether Bitcoin will eventually break this low and when it does it will likely correspond to Ether USD finally breaking this trend line and you can see that what a lot of times ethereum does is it sets a low and then later it retests that low sometimes it goes slightly lower last cycle it was basically a double bottom when are we going to test you know when are we going to that's the thing with crypto we normally set some type of macro low and then like a year later or something we we actually test the Integrity of that low and and so I still think there's you know something to look at there which that goes back to your other question of altcoins yeah I mean in the short term as long as Bitcoin stays elevated the AL you know the altcoins Can Can you know sort of keep up with Bitcoin but I think at some point ether USD breaks this trend line and then I think altcoins um take a pretty big haircut you mentioned how how Bitcoin often times or or these things re retest previous lows are you saying that there's a possibility that Bitcoin could retest its 15,000 and change low or or you think that one's now at this point passed so I use this so I there this regression rainbow that I've I've sort of mentioned before um and I can kind of show you where it is so basically we would either expect you know like a macro higher low a double bottom worst case scenario it could be a lower low depends on how bad things get but but if you look at all these prior Cycles after we have our sort of like our bare Market year we go to one regression ban and then sometime later on we then go to the one below it right so that happened right there and then if you go to the next cycle you can see that we first went to this regression band right here and then eventually we re we visited the one below it and in this case it ended up basically being a double bottom right and then you go to the next cycle and you can see the same thing right we we put in our first low but then eventually we Revisited the lower the regression band below it and because it was so much further out in time it ended up being a higher low because this regression band was higher than where it hit this one so then I just go to the current cycle and say all right where are we you can see that we went down to that regression band the same one that this one went to the question is is are we going to repeat the same pattern where we drop a regression band the funny thing is is the regression band right now is right at the prior lows right right so I think that you know if it were to if if we were to get a larger pullback in Bitcoin in the next few months then yeah like it's possible we could go back down there if it takes a few more months like if it you know if it doesn't happen until say like the summer assuming it happens at all but if it doesn't happen until SL closer to the summer then it could end up being something like this where it's you know it technically goes down a regression ban but it's a macro higher higher low yeah I think but but the issue though is I think if if Bitcoin comes back down here or anywhere close to that I I think ethereum that I I think the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is getting you know annihilated and and ethereum if it were to break that trend line that ether USD trend line that we were showing that's often times where it gets a a a a pretty big drop right I mean like if you just look at when it dropped below this trend line it was a 50% drop when it dropped below this trend line it was a 60% drop and I mean you know if it even if it took until say April to do so you know a 50% drop basically gets you back down to the prior lows so I I think that's probably what I'm still looking at as the most likely outcome uh but I I can understand why that that can be a frustrating view for a lot of people yeah totally totally um are you looking at so so one of the things and again you know I can show my charts on on gold here but but gold is trading today even though the stock market's closed we do have the Futures markets open a little bit and gold gold looks like it's basically flat I mean had a little dip here on the 10-minute chart and moving back up daily chart continues to kind of head back you know just one thing I know about pattern formation is when you get this sort of pattern where you have a flat top right and then the rising kind of what we call Rising or bull wedge usually the breakout ends up being to the upside so so one of the things at least according to what I'm seeing is that I'm actually expecting potentially within the next week to see gold break out to the upside here above this level finally you know we pierced it multiple times big time here but the question is what does that coincide with is it a risk off trade uh where we start to get scared about you know there's tensions in the Middle East that seem to be getting worse and worse and and stuff going on there or is it more about the fed and potentially they're going to cut rates more I mean what are your thoughts on like the fed and where we stand at this point yeah so I I think if gold were to get above I I agree with you Gareth I mean honestly I I tend to just defer to you when it comes to precious metal analysis but I will say for gold I I think that if it can durably hold above 270 kind of like above these prior Wicks I think that's a risk-off signal and as it relates to the ether Bitcoin pair I think of of if ether bitcoin's pair breaks down that is a riskof signal um and and you can see last cycle when gold this is the the candles over here right when it finally broke out that's where ether Bitcoin broke down right so and that was where ether USD finally broke down so so my view is that if gold were to get durably above 270 then you know maybe Bitcoin has a a couple more weeks that I mean in 2019 once gold broke out I mean when when gold broke out here it broke out you know the the 17th of June of 2019 bigcoin still was able to to stay risk on for two or three more weeks before finally getting a larger pullback so yeah I think that you know my sort of base base Outlook is is that Bitcoin continues to do what it needs to do to break all Bitcoin pairs down um it could get a you know a larger pullback potentially maybe even back to where we were talking about earlier but at some point I think gold probably breaks out ether Bitcoin breaks down and then going back to what you said I think the FED uh steps in and I I I think they uh they do what they do best and and that's going to be their they're going to bring back QE sometime this year because it's an election year you know if it weren't an election year maybe maybe they would be a little bit more strict but it's an election year I think there there's going to be excuses looked for to to why we need to turn the money printer back on but I think we're probably a couple months away at least a couple couple months away from that yeah I think right now the markets are still pricing in a March cut I think at the end of March is is what the First Cut is being priced in at and and I guess what I'm struggling with is okay we see a labor market that at least on the headline is still very very strong but the question is then is the underlying we've heard a lot about you know people getting multiple part-time jobs which makes maybe the the labor market seem better than it really is but what does it tell you about an individual who has to get multiple part-time jobs to be able to afford you know rent or whatever it may be um but but yeah I mean I guess it I guess that's the that's the one caveat here where you know we saw CPI data a little bit hotter last week PPI data came in a little bit less than than expectation so that kind of mitigated that but really as of now the labor market seems on the front line to be strong um does that eventually crack and you got to think at some point it does I mean you know we've been you know I thought Honestly by the end of last year we would have been in a recession and so far no sign of an actual recession at least according to the numbers I I I happen to think that a lot of us out there would agree that you know there are many people in this country that are probably feeling like it's a recession already well I know some people have sort of described it as like a rolling recession where it hits various sectors at various times maybe that's an appropriate view of it but I mean like I think you're right like there's there's definitely areas of the market that that look Rel like the labor market that still look relatively strong I mean like initial claims is one that I mean you know with initial claims coming in at at 202,000 that's really low right um but there are areas that that don't look that great I mean I was looking at this chart here this is uh highers like so total non-farm hes it's been dropping pretty quickly wow the last I mean that's a pretty big drop right like if you were to look at a year-over-year percentage change maybe take like a three-month moving average I mean it's basically been between like negative -6 to negative 7% for about a year now and so the question is is like you know at what point does something break right at what point does the labor market finally throw in the towel and and the unemp imployment rates starting to go up it would be interesting if you know gold broke out above 270 at the same time that eth Bitcoin broke down and at the same time that the unemployment rate hits 4% right I I think if it were to hit 4% that would that would probably raise a lot of eyebrows and that could get the FED to to start to do something to to turn this thing around interesting interesting so you know going into the rest of this week uh we're obviously getting into earning season and that's speaking of Labor Market I think it's worth mentioning that um last week City Group reported earnings and then they announced that they were going to lay off 20,000 people over the next couple of years which actually is 10% of their Workforce so it is a significant announcement um you know yes it's only 10% but still 10% is is significant for a company my question with that and this is this is just another thing I was thinking about is is are they going to lay off 20,000 because the economy is weakening or is it because they're finding that AI is beginning to displace some of the jobs that people do and and they're anticipating over the next two years or so these layoffs that are going to occur AI will replace it and that's kind of one of my bigger fears for the labor market is that once we do get to a point where the economy slows down it has a double whammy of this AI kind of taking over jobs in addition to a weak uh weak economy and that can really perpetuate a long recession versus just a limited recession I think it's possible that it I I think certainly AI will take some jobs but I also think there's another another view that's more optimistic and that's that while it will take away some jobs it will probably lead to the creation of a lot of new types of jobs um if you think like when spreadsheets were invented that killed off a ton of jobs that you know like a lot of the uh a lot of the jobs where people you know did not have the ability to just work on a spreadsheet online where you could just streamline everything that killed a ton of jobs but then it also brought in a whole new like class of jobs that didn't even exist before so yeah I think you're right I mean I think like there will be some jobs lost from AI I also think that there's a lot of companies just cutting costs right now because you know we don't know exactly how how aggressively the FED will pivot I think they will cut this year but will it be enough I don't know but yeah I think longer term it'll lead to to uh some new types of jobs you think so I I guess my one question would be and this is kind of a little off topic but but you know when when spreadsheets were invented right did did that tend to replace lowp paying jobs and did it increase did did it increase the disparity between High income and low income right and and we've seen that disparity of the middle class shrinking the poor groups you know increasing and then the wealthy like I just read over the weekend that you know the the billionaires basically doubled their wealth since covid while everyone else has basically been suffering and and I guess that would be and I know it's not really chart related but it's it's just an interesting little thought process of does this increase that disparity between poor and Rich I think yeah I think that's a good point um because it it makes it so that it's a more skill a skilled type of right yeah so the more skilled it is the you know the higher pay it's going to come with so yeah it could continue to to make that problem even worse like you know just making that Gap uh even wider um see I I I I could certainly uh see that over the next um you know over the next few years but that's a that's a really long process you know to play out I mean it's going to take years and I think to some degree you know the market in some areas has gotten ahead of itself with because you think the doc the internet bubble that occurred yes the internet ended up becoming the next best thing right one of the things that completely revolutionized everything but the market priced a lot of that in and then had to cool back for you know for a while before going back up I'm curious about what your thoughts are on um on on the stock market because you know the S&P has been struggling here to get back above um you know to get back above its its prior highs from from 2021 and I also know I remember in 2022 I I know that historically this this week like the the MLK week is not always that great for the stock market um I'm curious what your views are though I know you were you were potentially saying you could see it pushing up a little bit higher from here yeah I mean it's one of those things where I I think that there's a big fall on the horizon at some point but the timing of these big Falls is unbelievably hard because there can be delays right I mean you get the FED to mention that they're a little bit more doish it can delay something uh vice versa if they're more hawkish and different things like this but I do think that looking at the charts yeah I mean the S&P is into resistance here but one of the things that I've learned in in in decades of trading is that the markets love even numbers right so so whether it's 5,000 on the S&P and you could see that if you go back to 2021 we got to 4,800 and change but we never touched 5,000 and so there there's there is a chance you know I I think ultimately there's a big draw down in the stock market at some point probably associated with and and we've talked about this on this show many times that when the FED actually Cuts rates is actually when the markets usually decline so I still think that will happen but the question then is do we touch 5,000 or Pierce 5,000 to at least claim that thing and and one of the reasons it's very psychological even numbers are numbers go into human psychology of when you hit an even number you get the media to react you know the the cnbc's of the world grab their pom poms and do the cheerleading and you see it on every you know market watch and and Bloomberg and and it it basically creates the the last push of bullishness to get everyone that wasn't long to be on the long side and it stops out the last of the shorts if you will because they just like you know they're like oh my gosh it broke 5,000 it's a huge breakout you know and the bullishness is just kind of crazy but then that's usually the last gasp you know of of of Market power and so so I don't know if it will Pierce 5,000 but I'm leaning towards it maybe touching that granted it's only about what 4% away at this point but um but it wouldn't shock me if we do touch that but then I do still think I'm still in the camp that you know if you look historically at at fed cutting Cycles that's where that downside comes in and I still think again inversion of the yield curve right when it uninverted and we haven't uninverted yet so I mean it does lend us to think that maybe there's that little bit of upside left before maybe we uninverted y curve is probably one of the biggest headwinds I think for markets because it it does have a pretty good track record um and I think that it's it's frustrating because just how long the inversion takes yes or the   uninversity later and we haven't hit that recession yet and searches now have kind of gone the opposite way where now if you look up like the amount of searches for soft Landing no Landing like all of these things they're at the highs right and so so it's amazing to kind of use the tools and you're right we talked you just mentioned the internet and you know its creation and and you know proliferation in 2000 and look at these tools that we have now but it's just interesting to take note of that I agree yeah like the some of these spreads are actually getting pretty close to uninverted the two-year and the 10e has it's starting to close the gap right it's not it's not that far away from a potential uninversity yield curve right and the short end of the yield curve is is still relatively elevated to like 5 and a half% because that's where the FED funds right is but if the FED were to start cutting 25 basis points 50 basis points you know 100 basis points then you can no longer have like a one month treasury yield at at 5 and a half% if the if the FED funds rate is you know at four and a half percent so that's where you ultimately get the uninversity and my guess is what they're going to hope for when the money printer does come back on which I do think will happen this year I'm guessing what they're going to hope for is that they did enough to squash inflation and hopefully not come back with a second wave right right so I don't know scary thing that chart from the 70s is the scary thing is that you know they've said that they don't want to repeat those same mistakes but then you find that they're getting closer and closer to starting to cut rates again which in theory it makes money cheaper right so more people will borrow money more money goes into the system um and then does it create that second wave of inflation like in the 70s right I'm still thinking that there's a good chance that headline inflation will come down at least like in the short term like over the next like let's call it six months or so because like the the major contributions if this is like inflation year-over year approximation of contribution per category the main contribution right now is just housing right it's like this this this green in here and housing is very much a lagging uh category so I think I think housing will continue to be a headwind for CPI but once housing comes down and we're back to QE then that's the question of well did they stay the course long enough or are they making the same mistakes that they made in the 70s it's the truth man it is the truth um you know as we come to the end of the the show today I mean like you know as we come into this next week are you are you looking for any in particular like like what would be the one thing or two things that would catch your eye in the crypto markets or in the General Market in general um do you have anything that you're kind of saying hey I'm going to be watching this on the charts I mean I think the main things I'm I mean I think Bitcoin dominance is clearly something that's interesting uh for sure right now because there's conflicting views on it I mean historically it doesn't go up that much more in the having year but also it tends to to shoot up as ether Bitcoin breaks down assuming that it does so I think those are going to be the main things I'm looking at are you know the the relationship of ethereum to bitcoin and and whether if and whether or not if Bitcoin can can can break The Ether valuation of Bitcoin down um I I think that's you know for me that's the most interesting thing because my crypto portfolio has basically just been 99% Bitcoin for I don't even know I mean like for over two years now because I I've just been of the view that Bitcoin dominance would go up um so as someone who you know who is seeking out you know a chain in sort of the market structure I I'd be very curious to see if that's going to happen because the the thing that people should realize when it comes to eth bitcoin is that if it breaks down right if it breaks down is that once it does break down it tends to only last about two more months after that right I mean like look here it only lasts about seven more weeks and then here it lasted about you know maybe eight or nine or 10 more weeks so if it were to break down I don't really think I think you'd have a couple of months potentially of of watching it drop but then it would bought them out so that's what I'm going to be looking for um over the next over the next few months I think right now correct me if I'm wrong A lot of people are speculating on on an ethereum ETF which could be could be one of the reasons why uh it kind of explains some of the recent price action but I I will say you know if you look at at even this chart and as it relates to um to interest rates this this weekly Candle by The Ether Bitcoin pair right here in May 2019 two months before rate Cuts began was about a 17 to 18% move we just got a 17 to 18% move last week um so again I I don't know how much higher it's going to go but I'm mostly looking at at ether bitcoin's valuation Bitcoin dominance and of course if Bitcoin can can stay risk on long enough to to break ether down very cool man very cool yeah I would say for me for me I'm just kind of keeping an eye on the vix I think the vix has been you know we've been at kind of compressed levels on the vix and it'll bring that chart up and kind of end with this one but we can see that in the in 2020 with Co you had this massive Spike the only time in at least in my trading history when we saw a a spike of that magnitude was the the 2008 crisis right and when we saw the vix get up ridiculous levels um if we look at the distance between Big pops and the vixs here we were at 47 we touched again 47 or close to 50 uh multiple years later and again just something interesting here is if we take this high and we drag it out here about 211 trading days between that if we go from this high here at that same level and we go out here look at this we're approaching that almost about 208 bars uh since our last big pop so you know I do think you know if you look historically at the vix it's usually this amount of time or less between big Pops in the vix here and then here and then we really haven't done that so so little things like that you know just just kind of interesting data points that that I love kind of keeping an eye on it just tells me that complacency is in the market right now um a lot of that is based on the hope that the soft Landing or no Landing scenario happens and then I guess keeping an eye on the labor market and jobless claims are now you know jobless claims didn't mean a lot to me um but they're starting to mean more because it's these little signs that could spell something bigger for for me one of the biggest factors in whether the the FED Cuts or or Cuts later this year so I think that's really about it but yep is it just me or have there been I I don't really pay attention to it too closely but it seems like I've noticed a few more headlines about layoffs this month than I that I've seen in at least at least since October I agree and then that City Group you know just last week and then Black Rock actually announced some layoffs as well and what we'll see is as we get into earning season and this week we'll have more Banks than the tech companies come the week after is they seem to announce a lot of these layoffs at their conference calls um so I'm curious in the next two to three weeks what we hear but I agree with you it seems like it's starting to uptick a little bit um and again we'll have to watch the the tenure this week as well I think that'll be interesting guys if you're not subscribed to Garett make sure you do that links are all in the description below and we'll be here uh as fre I mean every Monday is our goal sometimes we miss normally if we miss it's because of me not Gareth I'm just not as Rel just because I don't do anything else just I was actually worried that I I wasn't gonna be able to do it today because um it's a uh it's a you know it's a teacher work day or it's you know it's the um the kids are out of school you know yeah but but fortunately my my wife got the kids out of the house K nice man make sure you guys follow Gareth if you're not following him same thing with Ben guys you know I think this this show is a great show lots of intriguing information and uh we'll be back next Monday so we'll see you guys at 11:00 next Monday take care",Youtube video,2024-01-15 00:00:00,"The transcript presents a generally bearish outlook on the cryptocurrency market, particularly altcoins, suggesting that the asset class will remain weak until the Federal Reserve resumes its easing policies. The analysts discuss the recent approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, which initially led to a spike in Bitcoin's price to $49,000 before a subsequent reversal back down to around $42,000. They note that this was a sell the news event, and that while the ETF approval is positive for the asset class long-term, in the short-term it resulted in a pullback.The analysts then examine Bitcoin's technical chart, noting that it has recently experienced its first 10% decline in over 149 days, which they view as a fairly standard pullback. They suggest that if Bitcoin breaks down further, it could find support around the $38,000 level, which is also the location of the 100-day moving average.Regarding the altcoin market, the analysts express a bearish outlook, stating that they believe altcoins will remain weak against Bitcoin until the Federal Reserve resumes quantitative easing. They point to the Ethereum-Bitcoin pair as a leading indicator, suggesting that if Ethereum-Bitcoin breaks down, it will likely coincide with a significant decline in Ethereum and the broader altcoin market.The analysts also discuss the potential for a risk-off trade, where they believe gold could break out above $1,270 if geopolitical tensions escalate or the Fed becomes more dovish. They suggest this could coincide with a breakdown in the Ethereum-Bitcoin pair and potentially a rise in the unemployment rate to 4%, which could prompt the Fed to restart its easing policies.Additionally, the analysts highlight the importance of monitoring Bitcoin dominance, as it is a key indicator of the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins. They suggest that if Bitcoin dominance increases, it could signal further weakness in the altcoin market.Overall, the transcript conveys a generally bearish sentiment, with the analysts anticipating further downside in cryptocurrencies, particularly altcoins, until there is a shift in the macroeconomic environment, such as the Federal Reserve resuming its easing policies.",435,"[0.02230835,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to provide an update to the bull market support band if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse docomo and the 21 we EMA there has been an influx of new social activity in the cryptoverse and often times that means there's a lot of newer people to the space and so if you are new it is worthwhile to Define SMA and EMA SMA is a simple moving average so that's the red line you see on the chart it is just an average equally weighted of the last 20 weeks the 21 week EMA or exponential moving average is the green line and that moving average weights more recent price data more than older price data so the price action from 21 weeks ago it's again it's a 21 we EMA the price action from 21 weeks ago is less relevant to the calculation of this moving average than say the price action from last week that's one of the reasons why when you see volatile moves in the market the 21 we EMA is often quicker to react to it because it waits current price action a lot more than price action that happened say 3 to four months ago you can see over here for instance when when the price topped out the 21 we EMA was a lot quicker to roll over than was the 20we SMA and you will see that time and time again how the the 21 we EMA is a lot quicker to react now at the current time the 20we SMA is currently just below $35,000 it's at around $334,950 the 21 we EMA is at around $ 36,7 159 so if we were to you know take some lities in in saying what it is giving some slack it more or less ranges from 30 5K to 37k 35k to 37k so perhaps think of it right now as approximately 36,000 36k now I'm not suggesting that that Bitcoin has to immediately go there what I am saying is that often times when you get these moves higher you will occasionally check back in with the bull market support band it's impossible to know exactly when it happens right it's impossible to know um but you can see there there have been a few times already during this move where we went back and and checked in with it and one of those times we actually fell below the bull market support band right here in August of 2023 fortunately we suspected that we would fall below the bull market sport band back then because we normally fall below the bullmark sport band in Q3 of the preh having year in fact it's happened every single Q3 of every prehab year and so that was something that I I think more or less anticipated however it did deviate from what happened in 2019 because in 2019 this put in a lower low compared to the June low whereas this cycle we did not put in a lower low compared to that low so the reason why I I wanted to to make a video on this again is because we we have talked previously and again there's no way to know if it's going to play out but you know for a couple of months I I've said about mid January could be when the next correction is right and I'm not suggesting it has to be massive right but I mean just a a a correction to sort of check back in with things and you know we're about we're about in mid January by the way I'm not trying to suggest that anything that's happened this week would constitute a correction hell the weekly the the weekly candle is still green you know it's still green so you know this price action does not constitute a correction like no one's going to look at this chart right here without any follow through and say oh yeah we had a correction but what I am saying is that you we previously talked about how some seasonality for Bitcoin it's strong and then as you get into mid January that seasonality it it it can fade right it can fade back down for for a few weeks and I I just want people to be aware of that it again it doesn't have to happen um you know and I I think a lot of people want to constantly know what is going to happen but I I will again tell you guys you know predicting short-term price action is is nearly impossible at least it is for me maybe other people are better at it but my view again is that you know we do occasionally check in with it and the 20we estim 21 with GMA is about 35 to 37k so just think about it as approximately $36,000 if it were to happen this week right like if we were to get a correction within the next couple of weeks it'd be around that price so I'll continue to sort of look at that as as a potential area of interest if there uh is a pullback to sort of see if it can in fact hold uh that would by the way from this top local top which again we could always take that out at a moment's notice but at least at the current high that would be about a a you know a 25% drop which isn't even that dissimilar from what we've seen I mean we've seen you know drops like 20% um 22% 22% and by the way I mean if there were a correction uh and if it were to take a while then you know by the time it drops 22% it could be you know Bitcoin the bull market support B by that point could even be at say 38k right it could be at 38k so I think it's it's a good idea to sort of occasionally remind ourselves of this because I'm I'm starting to see some comments from people saying that like you know there there's no reason to have a correction or a larger correction ever again um and it's kind of kind of reminiscent of of some of the stuff we saw back in like 2021 and even when we saw those comments in 2021 it still took weeks you know for a larger correction to really come we actually had two big Corrections um we had this one and then we of course had the one that came later but there was also this one right here that occurred in about mid January right about mid January right here you can see that Bitcoin had about a a 30 to 31% correction so I I think sort of keeping that that that in mind is useful one of the things that I've mentioned in terms of trying to identify a likely time to actually go check back in with it would be any type of weekly close below the 8we moving average so the 8we moving average is obviously a shorter term moving average it's a simple moving average that we're looking at but basically the reason why I'm bringing it up again is because there there has been a lot of history to show that if you drop below the 8 we at the very least you T you check in with the bullmark sport band right it happened right there it happened right here it also happened over here you can even find examples uh back over here where you know you drop below that 8we moving average and then you pretty quickly go back back down and and go to the bull market support ban sometimes you go below the bull market support ban sometimes you hold it as support for instance the last time we went we dropped below the 8 week and went to the bullmark sport band we did not hold it as support the times before that we did the two times before that we did over here when we dropped below it we did and then right here we did not so you know I mean out of the last really five obvious times three of the times the 20we SME held as support and two of the times it did not so where is the 8we moving average so I I'll remind people that the 8we moving average is at 42k so I I will continue and I I I was talking about that in the um you know in in NFA live yesterday is that if you get a weekly close below the 8-week moving average right so if you were to get a weekly close below 42k below this level right here then based on what we've seen over the last few years that would imply there's really high odds of of going back and and checking back in with the bull market sport band that doesn't even mean that it holds but at least going back and and checking in with it which I I think again you know the idea of of Bitcoin going back below 40K might seem absurd to a lot and and again I'm not I'm not suggesting that it has to but it is something that we should keep in mind right like it's something that we should keep in mind that that kind of price action can happen it's happened many many times already and and and then I think there you know you look for are there any areas of Confluence who suggest that this could even be a local High um you know they do come occasionally where you put in some type of a of a local high before getting a correction and I mean I think there is some evidence there's also some evidence to point to the contrary as well um some of the evidence to point to the contrary could be things like you know the spot ETF flows but I I also think you know Bitcoin does have a history of of putting in local tops sometime around these like major major events that that happen especially as it relates to traditional Finance um one of the things that we've mentioned that could Mark local tops are are things like FIB retracements uh back to the 618 so like if you were to take a let me switch this over to a linear scale but if you were to take a fib retracement tool and and just look to see where this current Wick has gone to it actually went to just north of the 618 so the 618 retracement is where we just had a wick two um and and and again like there there's plenty of times where you could go back in history and find where something goes to the 618 it gets a pullback and then it just keeps on going so I just want people to remember of that but also even even last cycle we we had a you know a similar type of move where we went you know we basically had a had a retracement to the 618 before just you know putting in a local top for a while and then taking out that high a little bit later on right so you can see that in 2019 this thing Wicked all the way up to just north of the 618 before falling back to the 8we SMA and then eventually falling to the bull market scorpion you can see though that when it actually fell to the 8we moving average we got a weekly close below it only the right back above it the following week and and still uh you know Kick the Can down the road but that I think is at least some evidence to you know to at least be aware of like sort of be cautious about say hey look this has marked uh you know periods in the past you know sort of that mid January time frame um the the retracement to the 61 like it has marked periods in the past where you you did get some sort of Correction and um and we'll see if that you know we'll see if that actually materializes or not the other thing that that played out already we were talking about this in the video a couple days ago the um the dubious speculation video there's the uh the logarithmic regression rainbow for Bitcoin and you know we talked about potentially you know potentially like revisiting this area up here well we did right we actually finally made it there the same area we made it to back in in the summer of of 2022 if you look closely you really can see that we basically Wicked up right to it right where that logarithmic regression band is and the reason that that is relevant is because when you go back and you look at at that two and a half log line rule that we've talked about before sort of dropping down two and a half log lines from one cycle to another this would actually be uh the the two and a half log line rule okay again doesn't have to play out by the way this logarithmic regression line by the time we we get to late 2025 we'll be north of 100K um so I I but I I did just want to sort of let people know that we did tag that level and we did go just north of of the 618 right so about that um you know that between like 48 and 50k I don't know exactly where it went but um and again like you can kind of see like last cycle when we had you know a similar Type move that also corresponded to kind of a rally into the First Rate cut Bitcoin rallied just north of the Dead cap Bounce from q1 of the bare Market year which is also something that we we just saw Bitcoin do it didn't go as high uh as it did back over here at least not yet I mean it could certainly could um but it did rally just north of that back in in 2018 before getting a larger pullback and also back in in um in in 2019 after getting a a red weekly candle after that entire move we then you know we got another green week after that and then we had a wick almost back up to that to that same level so you have to remember that like the the process can always take a long time to play out even if it is a correct view um the other thing that is interesting to look at is the the the extension from the bull market support ban because it it really does show you that that some of these things kind of are are are very constant and and similar to each other uh if you were to take a look at say the short-term bubble risk which is essentially just the extension of Bitcoin USD from its 20we moving average you can kind of see that like back in um back in 2023 we had a very similar pattern where you first you know you first go up to a a certain level uh right here about 40% extension from the 20we moving average and that was the same thing that happened right here and then after getting that extension from the 20we moving average rather than going further extended from the 20we moving average we put in a slightly higher high before then bleeding back down to the bull market support B and then again we held it as support so I I still and I'll keep going back to this idea of is that is that what's playing out now where you get that 40% extension that we got back in in December and then the last few weeks are potentially emulating you know this this this move over here right where you you get that 40% extension and then you spend a few weeks slowly grinding higher right slowly grinding higher and then getting a a correction back down to that bull market sport band the truth is I mean I I honestly like I don't know if it's going to play out like that but what I I would say is if there's you know a weekly close below the 8we moving average which again is at around 42k if we get a weekly close below 42k so below um below this level right here if we get a weekly close below that level then I think it would imply that the chances of revisiting the bull market support ban increase significantly so that would be sort of The View on that that I have that if we get below that 8 we a good chance we're going to go back down and and retest that bull market sport band not too long later um if you were to take a look at periods between tests of the bull market support band uh we can we could quick take a quick look at that as well um there's a few different examples here right so we tested it right there and then we got back down to it and we put in you know about 13 weeks later but the next low was 14 weeks later from here to here it took about 9 weeks the next next low was about 13 weeks later from this level uh all the way to this low that was about 15 weeks so we've already exceeded that um we're already looking at 17 weeks uh and we're nowhere near the bull market support ban right now so I mean if you if you look at it like that it would sort of imply that we're overdue for a correction but in my I mean in my own history like you know if you sort of doubling down on on a prediction like that and and saying that it has to happen it often times is a Fool's errand right because sometimes Bitcoin will grind higher you know far longer than a lot of people including myself think it will and then when it finally does correct no one really believes that it's going to um but I did just want to at least look at where the bullmark sport band is in case there is a larger correction and it's right around 35,000 to 37,000 uh at the current time and and I I did want to provide a little bit more of a of an inv evolved video on this one simply because we now are approaching mid January which for the probably the last couple of months we said is the next potential area of of of a correction right about mid January um seasonality for for Bitcoin you know in getting into mid January is often times not that great um you know you can see in 2021 uh very similar type of of thing it had a had a correction also in um you know even in 2018 in in mid January uh there was there was a rather large correction but then you have other times where it's not nearly as big I mean here you had a a a drop in mid January but it wasn't really that big like you know it was just um you know from 4K back down to to 3,300 that drop was only about um about it was about 20% drop so and this drop here was about a a 30% drop so I mean like it is you can kind of see that that January does often come in and and um lead to to some downside but for every time that I I could show you that I could probably find an example where where it doesn't but often times where where it's not getting a correction um like here in in 2019 it was already it had already gone through you know a 35% correction so I think that's sort of a Nuance to it it's more so that mid January has been um a potential area to keep in mind if it you know if we're going up into it so we have been going up into it probably worthwhile to sort of keep that in mind I know that if there's not a correction in mid January um you know the the the comments will be there again but and again I'm not I'm not trying to say it has to happen it's just look guys it's happened before um yesterday I saw I I saw my first comment uh in a while where where where someone someone said you know Bitcoin uh they they were talking about you know it not really ever getting a larger correction again and you know I know I know a lot of us sort of just roll our eyes at that sort of stuff but it does it it is a very cyclical type of thing right like it takes it takes a lot of new people in the space to start thinking that I think because a lot of the people that have been here longer would never suggest that Bitcoin can't go through another like you know 30 or 40% correction right like I think everyone is fully aware you know even the most even the most bullish people among us right even those people if they've been around for at least a cycle like they might be bullish out of their ears but they'll still admit yeah like Bitcoin will get 30 to 40% Corrections in the future but often times when you see those comments it's not coming from people that have been in the space it's not even coming from people that have been bullish for the last uh several years it's more so coming from people that are new to the space that are you know that are buying into all the hype and and just thinking like well there's no no way it'll ever go back down so I have I have seen one of those comments um perhaps as they as those comments become more frequent um the uh you know we should be on on on even more alert but anyways I I think that'll wrap it up that sort of provides an update to the bull market support band hopefully it's been useful to you guys and we'll see you know we'll see if if it if it plays out or not or if Bitcoin just keeps the grind going um and and continues to go higher um you know if you if you were to look at at at total Market uh it's gone up to about what 1 point 7 five trillion or almost 1.8 trillion which is not that far away from the midpoint of this line so we we showed where the midpoint of the line was for um or at least we sort of talked about about Bitcoin and and how far had to retrace but and back to where it was in the summer of 2022 you can see that this same type of line or similar type of thing but maybe different type of analysis exactly same thing though but this corresponds to about 1 point at the current time about 1.9 trillion we already actually got pretty close we got to 1.8 trillion already but anyways I hope you guys enjoyed the video make sure you get guys give the uh video a thumbs up if you like it um subscribe check out intothe cryptoverse premium at inth cryptoverse decom we still have the sale going on I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2024-01-12 00:00:00,"The video provides a detailed technical analysis of the Bitcoin market, focusing on the bull market support band and its significance in predicting potential corrections. The speaker discusses the differences between simple moving averages (SMA) and exponential moving averages (EMA), highlighting the 21-week EMA as a key indicator. The video suggests that Bitcoin may be due for a correction in the mid-January timeframe, based on historical seasonal patterns and the current proximity to the bull market support band, which is estimated to be around $35,000 to $37,000. The speaker cautions against overconfidence in predicting short-term price movements, acknowledging the difficulty in timing such events accurately. The overall sentiment of the video is cautiously bullish, as the speaker acknowledges the potential for a correction while maintaining a positive long-term outlook for Bitcoin.The main message and conclusion of the video is that while Bitcoin may be due for a correction in the near-term, the bull market support band around $35,000 to $37,000 remains a key level to watch, and that investors should be prepared for potential volatility in the coming weeks, while also maintaining a long-term perspective on the cryptocurrency's performance.",233,"[0.015945435, 0.01247406, -0.043060303,

Benjamin Cowen,Bitcoin: Dubious Speculation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7F6aw9-_wU,"Video Transcript of youtube video 'Bitcoin: Dubious Speculation' by 'Benjamin Cowen' released on 2024-01-10 00:00:00

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin dubious speculation if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom Bitcoin is currently uh just over $45,000 we have discussed this idea of getting a rally into the spot ETF and I don't typically talk about the news that much but yesterday there was a tweet from the SEC saying in fact that the spot ETF had been approved and then just a few moments later they they deleted that tweet and said that it was that their account had been compromised so you know if you were watching the markets yesterday especially on some of the lower time frames um like on the minute time frame you can see you know just what happened right so so I I think at about 311 Eastern you right here uh the SEC tweeted it out and then Bitcoin popped up just south of 48k and then it came crashing all the way back down to you know to below 45k but what's interesting is this Wick right here so not the low one but the one that just came after it that Wick corresponded to when they came out and and said oh you know just kidding this is not actually approved so quite a lot of uh mental gymnastics yesterday on on Twitter uh especially as the market made these considerable moves and you know I I know we follow Bitcoin dominance quite a lot and you know it's not my you know it's not my goal to just not talk about it when it's down and and so I'm this is not a Bitcoin dominance video but I I do just want to say you know it it did take a pretty big hit it's down to 53.6 one uh perc um still well up on the month but and again I'm not even sure if you go look at like a minute time frame for dominance it'd be interesting to see what dominance did uh during that time so you can see that dominance actually Wicked all the way up to about 55.3 three% so I believe that's a new a new cycle High 55.3 three the weird thing that trading view does I guess is that they don't always include lower time frame stuff like on on minute time frame and so while it did go up to 55.3 three on the minute chart you can see that on the daily it it more or less topped out at around half you know at around a percent below that so just wanted to provide an update there I know it has taken a bit of a hit recently one of the things that we've mentioned many times are are are at least comparing this business cycle with the last business cycle and and it's it's it's it's a very difficult thing mainly because you can you can always look back at at the last cycle and say all right well you know when the FED pivoted that was not that great for for for Bitcoin the problem is we don't know when that's going to be right I mean we can we can speculate on it and and the market is always speculating on it if you were to go look today the market is saying about a 60 you know if you combine these two probabilities right about a 70% chance or so 69 a half% chance that we'll have a rate cut by March the reason I mentioned that is because again last cycle I I I cannot promise what's going to happen this cycle but last cycle Bitcoin found a local high just before the First Rate cut the problem of course is we don't know when the First Rate Cut's going to come like I mean if it comes in March then that and it were to play out in a similar manner as over here then you know the expectation could be that Bitcoin puts in some type of local top a month before that right so like in February but if on the other hand the First Rate cut doesn't come until say may which at the current time there's only about a 5% chance 4.9% chance that the First Rate Cuts not till May but it doesn't come till May then um you know a month before that would be April which of course is is the the month in which the Bitcoin having will occur to me it certainly seems like this cycle more than others is much more driven by by narratives than than anything else it seems like we're just constantly chasing one narrative to another whether it's the spot Bitcoin ETF whe whether it's people speculating on on a spot ether ETF whether it could be the Bitcoin having and so you know some people have have sort of argued that dominance could top out um you know around the spot ETF and look guys anything's possible I I'm not going to sit here I'm not going to say that I can't but if you were thinking of what other narrative could be you know could push it up perhaps the having would be one to to look towards but that's still you know that's still three months away one of the things that I I think that it's worthwhile to look at and this is always in terms of managing the downside risk is is just again sort of an acknowledgement that if we were to go below the 8we SMA which again we're not there yet but if we were to go below it historically that means at least in recent years when you go below 8 we you tend to then go to the the bull market sport ban right so going below the 8 we tends to take you to the bull market sport ban we're not there right I mean like even though there's been times over here we we got below the 8 we we then went down to that 20we SMA or 21 week EMA or even below it we're still holding the 8we SMA as support right so the market is still trending right now the 8we SMA is currently at around at just over 42k so the argument of course is so long as Bitcoin stays above 42k then we're still above the 8we and it's not clearly riskof Dynamics just yet and it's important that we you know we acknowledge that because there are certain metrics that if they were to give the signal of risk off it could imply that Bitcoin needs to go back down and and recheck with its bull Mark sport band which it hasn't really checked in with since October now some of those riskof indicators that we've discussed one of which got a bounce today right so the ether Bitcoin valuation had a had a pretty large move here after taking out the June 2022 low so one of the things that I've mentioned before is that if we get a weekly close below the June 2022 low then that at least in my view would imply a risk off signal as you can see that last cycle when we finally closed below the this low right here from November of 2017 when we finally Clos below it if you were to Overlay Bitcoin USD onto that chart closing below it essentially gave us a a a a riskof signal right and it it didn't mean that Bitcoin didn't hang around that area for a while in fact it did I mean it it even went back up and and put in a double top after ether Bitcoin broke down the thing to look for today though is that while we have Wicked below it we just put out a video on ether Bitcoin just yesterday while we did Wick below it we have not put in any daily closes below it and so until there's a daily close or sorry until there's a weekly close and we haven't put any weekly closes above it we also haven't put daily closes below it either but until there's a weekly close below this level then it still has not yet given the same type of riskof signal that we got over here okay so again so far it's just simply a wick nothing more nothing less it's just a wick and I'm not overly interested in wicks in the video on The Ether Bitcoin pair you know I said that it can always get a bounce back up and and rally back up to that bull market support band which is still higher than where it is right now for the for the ether Bitcoin pair so again one of the riskof signals is would be in my opinion would be a weekly close by Ether Bitcoin below the June 2022 low that hasn't happened yet right and so it's important to respect that and say all right well until that happens that riskof signal has you know has not yet materialized in the same way that it did last cycle now again if Bitcoin were to go below the 8we you likely go to the bullmark wor band but as long as it's above the 8we it's always interesting to think about like well what are the next targets for Bitcoin USD so long that it can hold that 8we SMA and of course there's you know there's plenty of them that we can we can take a look at um one of which is is actually more so based on the total market cap but you can kind of apply it uh to bitcoin fairly easily if you were to look at let me go to a weekly time frame of total Market you can see actually that uh if we connect the dots right so just sort of connecting the dots at the tops there here and here and then connecting the bottoms at least the weekly close you can see that the 2019 rally that topped out just before the First Rate cut arrived topped out at the midpoint of this trend line now the midpoint of this trend line this week would be about 1.9 trillion or so so from the current price to get to 1.9 trillion the market would have to move up let me zoom in here so I can get it a little bit more accurate because I'm not I'm not really really it's hard to see exactly where it is right so right now that would correspond to about a 14 to 15% move to get you to the total market cap of 1.9 trillion now remember that's just total Market if Bitcoin were to go up 15% and total Market stays constant then you still haven't hit that level but if Bitcoin were to see a rise up to you know let's say 15% that puts it in the low 50k range right the low 50k range so the low 50k range assuming that it can lift the rest of the asset class up commensurate with itself the low 50k range would put total market cap at sort of the midpoint of this channel which again you can see that it has it has held some type of significance back in August 2022 and in in June of 2019 and of course in July of 2018 so that I I think would be a relevant level to sort of keep in mind is total market cap getting up to the midpoint of this channel um other than that I mean you know we can always go look at at at some of the other metrics some of which are are more interesting I I think than others um one of which if would it would be that if we were to go over to uh some of the charts over here one of which is the running one-year Roi that's currently coming in at around um let me see if it'll load here yeah at around 2. 588 okay so it is getting kind of extended but you can see that the last couple of Cycles it did go a little bit above that if you were to compare it to a similar Point um before getting a pullback now remember Bitcoin started to Rally in January of 2023 really starting around this time so if the one-year Roi is going to go up from here then the Bitcoin the price of Bitcoin would have to go up uh quicker otherwise the running oneye Roi will Top out for instance if you were to project out a price even at the current prices let's just even put in 40 let's just even put in 48k right if you were to put in a price of 48k a month from now you're still going to see the one- year Roi come back down because again in January of 2023 we saw Bitcoin rally so that's often times you'll see Bitcoin gets a pullback on the the one year running Roi after you know after a a year-long rally or so um that's one metric there there's a few others uh that we could look at as well um one of which is taking the ROI from the 2022 low so if you do that and just comparing it to the last two cycles zooming in you can see we're we're actually still in between the ROI of the last two cycles so we're above cycle three uh but below cycle two or sorry below cycle 4 right so you can see right here the purple line This is the current cycle uh green line is last cycle and then the orange line is a cycle before that and you can see the distinct characteristics of them like last cycle we of course had the pandemic drop cycle before that Bitcoin just sort of slowly trended um and then eventually got another another move up uh on day you know in the in the day 500 range or so and again right now we're currently on day uh 425 so you know day 500 that that would be getting you closer to you know to the having right day 500 because I mean that would be about what 3 months from now 3 months from now so you know when I look at at at these sorts of of of charts and and think about what are the most likely outcomes um if Bitcoin were to accelerate to the upside immediately let's say on spot ETF approval or something uh then it might need to cool down closer to the having but if on the other hand it doesn't do that and it just kind of Trends sideways for a couple months then you could make the case that it'll make that move going into the having and so a lot of it again is is very much narrative driven right it's very much narrative driven and I just go back to these you know these these ideas of of what are various signals that could be interpreted as riskof one of which is the breakdown of ether Bitcoin on the weekly time frame but that hasn't happened you know and as as much as I would like to see it break down because I think it it it it makes the most sense to me I also have to be honest and say Well it hasn't happened yet and you know this is a pretty big move by The Ether Bitcoin pair I'm not I mean I'm not going to you know pretend like it's not um if we were to look at the daily on this it's not like we haven't had these moves and we we've seen ether Bitcoin you know slowly go down and then just get a crazy move to the upside um is what it does right and again if you were to look at at the the relative strength index on on The Ether Bitcoin pair you know really going all the way back to the merge maybe even before the merge it is you know it has been putting in a lot of lower highs in terms of that daily RSI and I did say in the video you know if if ether Bitcoin does get a bounce after taking out these prior lows you can see every time it puts in a new low it then gets a bounce um but if it does take out that low and gets a bounce I would be looking towards that you know that bull Mark sport band and it's always possible that it comes back up and and sweeps this level here right you know comes back up and then and then sort of Fades down again historically when it bounces like this it then you know takes a little while to fade back down like it as you can see right it it you get a a pretty sharp bounce and then it and then it takes a while to fade back down right a pretty sharp bounce and then it takes a long time for for it to then fade back down to where that bounce actually originated from so just want to point that out so for me what I'm looking for to interpret a potential riskof signal for Bitcoin would be the weekly close of ether Bitcoin below the June 2022 low and again that hasn't happened yet um so until that happens um I I I will still continue to look at this and say all right well as long as it's above the eight-week SMA then the next you know what are the next targets and of course there's other there's other metrics that we could look at as well we could look at the logarithmic aggression rainbow uh the the band up here is is currently just below 49k yeah so the same band that we rallied up to in in August 2022 is now um at around 49k so about you know four um I guess a little less than $4,000 above where we currently are but again it's also an increase increasing value right like the the regression bands are are moving higher as a function of time and so that would be a level uh to keep in mind the other levels of of Interest would be to sort of looking just to kind of get an idea of what happened last cycle now I go back to this idea of well what happened last cycle uh of course does not have to be what happens this cycle in fact my base case is that it probably won't be the same thing every every single cycle seems play out somewhat differently um if you were to take a look look at at the fiber Trac tool last cycle you can see that Bitcoin topped out at the 618 actually just a little bit higher than the 618 retracement um we haven't reached that level yet we have come somewhat close but we haven't actually reached it remember last cycle it went above that level so the 618 currently is around 48 and a half um measured from the second peak of course if you measure it from the first Peak we've already reached the 618 uh which i' I've previously pointed out but reaching that level reaching that level would you know correspond to this same move here where it takes out that deadcat bounce high from the bare Market year right so this is the deadcat bounce high from the bare Market year and it's trying to take that out and you can see that in 2019 it was able to take out that high just before the First Rate cut arrived right just before the First Rate cut arrived you know which occurred in July so just before that Bitcoin was able to take out the the q1 deadcat bounce high from the bare Market year so this time you know the q1 bare Market you know sort of the deadcat Bounce from the bare Market year um is right around 47k or so um yeah right around 47k so we have we actually have already taken that out but again last cycle it it actually went Above It by about you know 15% or so there's that 15% again right that 15% number kind of coming back from from Total market cap and seeing where where Above This would it need to go to even reach the you know that part of the of the midpoint and that would be about a 15% move but again the longer it takes the higher Bitcoin or the asset class would have to go to reach the midpoint right if it if we don't reach it till March then that would imply a 20% move um to reach the midpoint of that channel so a lot of things to consider there and again you know there's always other outcomes as well in the short term uh for instance there could be a you know a larger pullback back to the bullmark support band to check in um before getting a bounce there we've seen that before and in fact if you were to look at the short-term bubble risk of Bitcoin what you'll notice is that we actually extended to the same level that we extended to back in March of 2023 in fact right so you know and the first top here did not actually correspond to that local top before we then bled back down to the bull market support pan right you can see it pretty clearly this High here did not correspond to the top as well so you can kind of see that like it it looks to me there are some similarities right you get you get this High the extension from the 20we SMA right here but it did not Mark the top for that rally you can see that Bitcoin did extend that rally a bit further and then it cooled off back down to the bullmark squarepin and then the same thing over here right like it hit that extension from the 20we and it's gone up right a little bit more right it's gone up a little bit more we'll see if it if it continues to play out if it plays out like it did you know about 10 months ago or so then it would imply you know within the next couple of weeks or so getting a a larger pullback to that bull market support ban I will remind you that you know you could always have an example where ether Bitcoin does not break down in the short term but Bitcoin still gets a correction right where Bitcoin goes back down and it did not go up high enough to break ether Bitcoin off of its support and then we have to just kick the can down the road and we try again you know we try again potentially in another month or two um so I I would be aware of of that potential idea um as well and you know and again today could be a really interesting day if if the Spy ETF is approved right I mean if that stuff is approved then price action could be all over the place we saw what happened on the minute chart earlier once you know once the market thought it was approved and then that completely changed so that's what I'm looking at I'm I'm I'm essentially just looking at at these indicators that we just discussed looking at like Roi from the bare Market low um looking at at things like the the running onee r I um and and there and there here's the short-term bubble risk that we that we just pulled up so those are some of the indicators that I'm I'm sort of watching and then of course there's also just comparing these moves the extension from the 20we estimate compared to what we did over here and and also the ether Bitcoin pair right for me The Ether Bitcoin pair is is an interesting view into crypto because I do consider ether a blue ship but it also has been bleeding against Bitcoin since the merge and there's there's definitely some different views right now um that are are probably worthwhile to discuss so so one of those views that that some people have speculated on is that this is the low of ether Bitcoin and guys I mean the markets humble all of us right I'll be clear about that I've been bearish on ether Bitcoin since the merge I do think it's more likely to eventually break down than up but I also think it's worth worthwhile to consider other viewpoints and that's why I've said before if you want to hedge you know it's worthwhile to hedge with that said with that said risk off signals for Bitcoin and say for the altcoin market last cycle did not occur until ether Bitcoin broke down on the weekly right until it broke down on the weekly the riskof signal did not occur and I keep going back to this idea well you know what if it what if Bitcoin pops out a local top a month before the First Rate cut just like last cycle and we can look at that and be like all right well that makes sense that means you know could be you know could be any time right could be February uh if the rate cut comes in March but then that's true but then what if the rate cut doesn't come until May right and then you just you know you kick the can down the road and there are reasons why it could be delayed until May for instance if if the labor market were to continue to remain tight and the economic data comes in exem extremely hot like let's say inflation we're going to be getting an inflation report relatively soon if that were to come in relatively hot then that could delay that could delay when the First Rate cut will come and if it does delay when the First Rate cut will come then it could delay you know the idea of of when could there be a local top before the First Rate cut arrives right so it's just like the market it's sort of like a game of chicken between like the Federal reserve and and you know the the the the stock market because the stock market just sort of keeps slowly going higher and the fed you can kind of get the sense that pow would like to cut because there is some weakness in the labor market but as long as risk assets keep going up you you potentially also have the wealth effect taking place so it's really you know it's it's really a game of chicken to some degree um one other way to look at the market that I I was looking at earlier is is to look at the the the relative strength index of of Bitcoin and actually look to see you know we've actually on the on the weekly we've actually been overbought since October but as I've said using RSI to to buy and sell is a Fool's errand right because it can remain overbought for months sometimes years can remain oversold for months 4 years in fact in 2020 you can see that the weekly RSI crossed into overbought territory in October which is exactly when it crossed here you can see that it also did not durably break down until April so I think the argument would be well if the First Rate cut arrives in March then perhaps this the weekly RSI will break down in February but if the first rate does not arrive until May let's say economic data comes through such that the FED feels like they have to keep holding until May then perhaps it'll play out something like that where it doesn't the weekly RSI doesn't sort of fall back down until we get to right around the time of having um so different ways to look at it there's also one other metric just while I'm thinking about it before I go to to pull up and that's the fear and greed index uh we're currently at a at a level of 73 to to look at the the values of it more specifically you can see that it actually broke to a new local high uh at 76 to extreme greed which it had not been at 76 throughout this entire move um the reason why that's interesting is because you can see that in 2019 just before that midcycle top Bitcoin went all the way at the fear and greed went all the way up to 95 so that might be another riskof signal if it arrives would be a a a fear and greed print of in the 90s right in the 90s would be I I I think a a riskof signal so I think I think it really just depends on on how long this move takes whether you know whether Bitcoin can break The Ether Bitcoin valuation down or not I know people are speculating of course on on the same type of spot ETF stuff or ethereum which could certainly delay things as well but just trying to be honest about the market um and and just a reminder you know My Views while I do feel very strongly about them at times they're often wrong and that's the truth uh they're often wrong and I just want you to remember that and and I I just want people to to have a strategy stick to it and in terms of navigating the market right we can talk about short-term price action implications of that um but in terms of actually navigating the market and having exposure to the market my my my suggestion would be to just have a a strategy stick to it and and and ignore uh all the news and and all that other sort of stuff uh that's probably your your best bet anyways if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on intothe

 hey everybody Welcome to the no shill Zone Ben and I are back how you doing Ben how was your holiday pretty good how about you good man good actually like I was just saying to you before we started I'm excited to get back into the charts get back into kind of the groove you know holidays sometimes can throw things off but uh but it's good to be back and it's good to talk charts and we got a lot to talk about we got a Bitcoin spot ETF that from what I'm hearing probably by Wednesday we have approval um the question is does Bitcoin surge to the upside uh or does it fall is it a sell the news event or is it a a buy the buy the news event what are your thoughts on that yeah well I mean I I think it's it's interesting because I was in in in terms of it's outperformance like it's been relatively outperforming a lot of the rest of the asset class class right and we can see that with with the Bitcoin dominance and this is something we've we spoke about a lot um going into you know in last year and and even we I'm sure we'll speak about it a lot this year too uh yeah I mean look with with Bitcoin going into these events you know I I mean it it it these narratives are are something that a lot of investors hold on to for dear life right and you know it certainly could be you know it certainly could be something that that we rally into but I I do think it's important for investors to remember that even after it right there still can be significant Corrections i' I've seen a lot of people sort of suggest that you know it's it's essentially up only and I when we get to this point where you know it seems like no one thinks it could ever go down again I I do start to you know get concerned um about that and I I was actually looking at at some of the data on that and I I think this might might be an interesting chart to look at this is is the number of days since Bitcoin had a 10% Decline and kind of going back through all of history and it's only concerned with daily data um so like there are some periods where we get Wicks you know where it's already dropped 10% but it is starting to flirt with historical records right like we're on day 144 the longest that's ever gone is like you know 155 or something right like so another 11 days or something yeah so I do think you know it while important to recognize that like spot ETFs and and even the having right they're they're certainly great narratives are certainly going to lead to long-term uh long-term money coming into the asset class I do want people to remember that there can be pullbacks and when you do get pullbacks like the one we saw this past weekend uh a lot of the altcoins took pretty big hits even though bitco only dropped like you know a couple of percent or so yeah and I think that's so important to recognize I saw your um dominance chart up I just want to show this this on the dominance chart real quick that's just something I saw as I was bringing it up but if you take these these recent lows and you just connect a line right through it right so we draw a parallel up and look at what that aligns perfectly to so so what this tells me is dominance is staying within a range right now and it could get as high as this upper part which would be near 56% uh downside continues to inch up so the dominance again is is in an upward channel so the high the lows are still higher lows um and then like you were saying like the the altcoins I got made fun of and bashed so much for shorting altcoins and then this weekend I closed out three so far for over 20% gain um because again you know it's it's it's doing what I've done for 24 years of trading right it's it's looking at charts I don't care what it is right and I think that's the important thing is that you know it could be eggs it could be milk it could be gold it could be anything but there are things that repeat historically and you look at you know for instance charts of uh AV Avalanche right amazing move up but just a little too high too fast and you look for these check backs and and yesterday you know again pulling back as low as around 31 after being at 50 I mean it was an incredible move and so it's not to say that Avalanche won't do well in the future I don't think you or I and will gladly admit that we don't know where these things are going to ultimately go in the next five years but you know they ran too hard they'll ran a little too fast you know salana same kind of deal and they're just due for pullbacks and uh markets obviously are focusing right now on bitcoin and the spot ETF the the 56% level is is really interesting because I think there's some Confluence around that level you we've looked at this like FIB retracement on dominance before where it rallied back up to the 618 last cycle and we've sort of noted like all right well if it does that again this cycle that puts it at 60% but what's interesting about the 56% level is do you see here when it crossed the 0. five which was basically you know today that would correspond to 56% like the 05 FIB retracement um last cycle when it across the0 five FIB retracement that marked the local top right so while dominance continued to go up after we went past the 0 five which today would be 56% that is ultimately what marked that sort of like that midcycle top which is interesting because that midcycle top also came right before interest rates started to go back down interesting it really seems like it's playing out in a very similar manner like you know Bitcoin potentially surging to 56% which is a 0.5 FIB retracement just a month or so before rate Cuts arrive and then what we'll notice is that dominance last cycle did not top until after rate Cuts arrived so it was basically The Ordering of it was Bitcoin tops then the First Rate cut arrives then Bitcoin dominance tops so I'm really curious to see if it's going to play out in a similar Manner and the narrative is certainly there for it I mean you have the spyf thing you know the narrative that we we were just is talking about there's a lot of altcoins sitting on some fairly precarious support levels on their Bitcoin pairs right like like ether Bitcoin is right at that June 2022 low then you have to wonder if if the spotf narrative is what's going to finally break the E Bitcoin valuation down now that's one thing I wanted to talk to you about so ethereum has has lagged not only Bitcoin but it's lagged altcoins like what's what's the issue here what's going on with ethereum why can't it catch a bid I mean it certainly doesn't per isn't performing like some of these all coins that have gone 2x 3x 10x even um is it just that people are now looking at salana they're looking at Alternatives is it kind of like the breakdown of the future of ethereum or or is it just a period of time I think it's just a period of time I I don't I mean honestly I don't really think ethereum has any competitors frankly I think it's fundamentally I think it's a lot better than the other than the other uh the chains that it's attempting or the the other chains that are attempting to compete with ethereum I think ethereum is is fundamentally better what I think what I think where we are with the ethereum Bitcoin valuation is I I I think we're essentially repeating this pattern right here from the last cycle where you essentially have this low that you put in and after you know after that low if we take a week like a date range here from this low to when it actually broke down it was 83 weeks right it was 83 weeks from this low here we're currently on 82 weeks and what's really interesting interesting is that when it broke down when it finally broke down last cycle that's ultimately what marked that that top for Bitcoin so again some Confluence with The Ether Bitcoin pair as it relates to you know to bitcoin dominance that Stu so I I think that essentially it's I don't think ethereum is dead or anything like that I I just think that this is the part of the cycle that we're at and and my guess is that sometime over the next several weeks we'll see it um you know break down into this region over here and then from here you know somewhere in here I would I would suspect it will find a low from there what price is that approximately yeah I mean so so so my my target for The Ether Bitcoin pair has been between 0.003 to 0.4 I think that is ultimately what will Mark the final low for E because I do think it will be a higher low compared to compared to this like I don't think it's going to go all the way back down to like less than 0.02 um I I think it could be sort of a macro higher low we also got these macro lower highs and arguably what's happening is that ethereum is is converging on its Bitcoin pair to whatever say the fair value is right um and you know if you if you were to think about this in terms of like some type of you know regression model you can kind of see like you know as it's slowly figuring out where that fair value is I think that's basically where we are and it's going so I'm guessing my my guess is it does something like this where you know it falls in here spends some time here and then eventually moves back up into into early 2025 gotcha now just just going to my chart on the ethereum I just wanted to show people that that you have this ever since it bottomed out it's basically stayed within this channel range as well and and what you're talking about you know if ethereum does dip you know I have Max downside this longer term trend line the base of the channel is around the 1650 1660 area down here so I don't know if that coordinates with anything but but it is just interesting to look at ethereum how it gets to the high end then goes to the low end high end low end and then we're back just underneath the high end at this point of the channel uh that's really gone on for now uh almost a year and a half about over a little over a year and a half since we put in that bottom so interesting stuff on on the crypto markets and moving more towards the economic picture I mean you were just mentioning the ism data uh if you want to kind of talk a little bit about that and we can talk jobs numbers as well yeah there's been a lot of conflicting reports when it comes to jobs numbers right like so if we were to look at at like initial claims are really really low I mean they're like at 200,000 continue claims are are not that bad I mean they're they're kind of elevated but not that bad yet but the ism you have you have a few data points that are bad the ism services employment uh came in at 43.3 uh which was a huge drop from the the prior month at 50.7 so you know I'm interested to see if this is a fluke if it's just some type of fluke coming out of the holidays that's going to get you know revised away next month or if you know it'll just shoot back up next month but that's a pretty big you know that's a pretty big story and I believe for those of you watching I believe anything below 50 is contraction right yeah so I mean you can see on this chart here like it's um I mean where it is right now I mean it's it doesn't even look that different from what we saw back in 2020 in terms of the the rate at which it's dropping so that's yeah I I was that's the issue with the FED is that they tighten and tighten and tighten because everything is looking good and then eventually it breaks like that and then they're forced to cut like several hundred basis points right and I think that's what I mean for the everyone out there if those of you that were around or trading back in ' 08 uh 0708 that's basically what happened is the economic data started to slip slowly everyone kind of rote it off because the jobs data was staying so strong and then once the jobs data started to turn it was like a cliff dive um and I think that's because on a psychological basis you know business owners they want to believe in the soft Landing narrative right I mean we're being told that oh the fed's going to engineer this Perfect Landing and so they don't want to fire anyone right I mean hey if we're gonna have a perfect landing and we're going to take back off like like why would you want to let go people go that are doing good jobs and then then have to come back and find people again right especially during covid when it was so hard to find people and so this this thought process is that until they really lose hope that the economy is not going to take off again they're going to not lay off people and I think that's why jobs data stays so strong until it doesn't and then it collapses down um the other thing to keep in mind too is you know the jobs data on Friday we know they the it it was good yields did rally a little bit but if you look at today the tenure is right back down negating all of that gain and there's a lot of talk about that jobs data even though more jobs were created in the non-farm payrolls than expected a lot of it was part-time work um in fact a majority of it was part-time work or people being hired uh in the government and I think that also sways people into saying wait a minute is this really a strong jobs Market or are people just taking three part-time jobs because inflation has has wrecked them to the point where they have to be able to pay their rent yeah yeah I mean it it and again this stuff lags business Cycles take forever to play out and they often take years to play out um and this cycle has been taking a long time because there's been so much excess you know in terms of all the money printing there's so much liquidity just sosing around and has been sloshing around for a long time I mean look at job openings yes it's it's it's basically it's been down only since March of 2022 but it was still there was so much excess right we were so far above the trend it's taken two years just for job openings to basically get back to the prior Trend um and so yeah now the fed's got to figure out well how do they stop this downtrend you know soon enough because you know there's still a lot of monetary policy that has to work its way through the system that's likely going to continue to be a headwind for things like job openings um and so on so forth so I I I do think there are some areas of weakness in the labor market and then other Reports look fine so so right now we have the FED basically saying hey we're going to cut three times in 2024 the Market's been saying six now it's five and a half times I think somewhere in that vicinity you know what's what's creating this disparity um I guess that would be my first question and then number two is what is your thoughts do you think it's three or do you think it's six or do you think it's somewhere in between my my thought because if you look at this chart or the table the from the CME Group it looks kind of just like oh 25 basis point rate Cuts every single meeting um but I I think what we're seeing here is basically and I think we've mentioned this before is like a bimodal distribution where you have you know some investors basically thinking that it's going to you know the feds is going to slowly cut and there's not going to be any Fallout from that and then you have other people sort of banking on a hard Landing where a few 25 basis point rate Cuts isn't going to do anything you know it's not if you're a business and you're and you're not hiring someone at at five and a half percent rates because the consumer is too weak if you if they go back down to 5 percent it's not like that's going to immediately fix their B the business issues that they're having right they needs to be significant Cuts so my guess is that they will cut this year I'm guessing the FED will will get the First Rate cut in the first half of the Year could be March it's probably the Bas the best the best base case right now is about March January is probably going to be too soon for a rate cut I mean especially with inflation where it is I think to save phase they probably should wait until March um at least but um yeah I I would I would suspect there will be uh rate Cuts this year my guess if I had to guess I would say you know they'll probably cut initially they'll probably cut 25 to 50 and and then they'll recognize that that's not going to be enough um to sort of slow down bankruptcies and delinquencies and all that sort of stuff and then they'll and then they'll cut a lot more and it could be you know it could end up being a cut of of several hundred basis points I mean you know 100 200 basis points uh is is always possible if they if they really need to get things back on track if it if it start if the economy starts to deteriorate are you do you think that rate cuts are coming this year or do you think the economy is strong enough to hold out for all of for the entire year without them no I I do think rate cuts are coming this year I I think though that the FED is going to be as careful or as cautious on rate Cuts as they can because they are worried about repeating the 80s issues with vulker and having a spike again in inflation so so Myas is just like they were behind the curve initially with inflation and raising rates they'll be behind the curve on cutting uh because again they just worry that Hey listen if we see a secondary spike in inflation that's going to really be a huge detriment and we know that Jerome pal has said that many times he doesn't want to repeat those mistakes and so that's my guess of of what happens is they'll they'll cut a little bit but they'll be behind the curve we'll slip into a much worse recession and they'll have to overcompensate with more Cuts either at the late this year or early in 2025 but it it is interesting to kind of see it all playing out before our eyes and and and wondering you know where does the stock market end up right I mean you know we know historically that the stock market you know people are always saying Hey listen buy stocks because they're going to start cutting rates and printing money but historically that's not always the best thing to do yeah well I mean I think a lot of times rate Cuts if we think about like logically why would the FED cut rates when when infl you know inflation is as high as it is I mean like if if they start to cut rates 25 to 50 basis points I think everyone's going to interpret that as like well think about how bad the economy must be if they're going to cut rates with inflation as high as it is I also you know you mentioned the financial crisis I do like to compare this cycle to that one occasionally it's important to recognize everyone that analoges do not play out in the same way ever I've been tracking so many of these analoges for so long they never they never pan out in the same way but just for reference just to get an idea of how long some business Cycles can take this is the S&P the S&P 500 Roi to low after inversion of month and 10e yield the blue line is this cycle and then the light blue line is the financial crisis cycle so like you can see how long it can take to play out like just because it doesn't play out in you know in a few months doesn't necessarily mean anything and in fact the S&P was still putting a new highs even you know a week or two out from from right now in the during the financial crisis cycle so again it's important to recognize that and you could also look at it you know and look at other Cycles as well and see how for a long time they'll they'll match and then eventually they'll they'll diverge so again it's not going to play out the same way the financial crisis did but it is just something to be aware of that hey these things can take years yeah yeah absolutely and and speaking of the S&P if we take a look today I mean we've seen you know we talked about it earlier uh before the stream but but we saw kind of one of the worst starts to the year on the S&P on the NASDAQ with the amount of down days uh but one of the things that I like to just mention is that you know when you look at the amount of upside that we saw right so we take a look at the move from just late October into year end you had a 17% move and so to see a what do we get about a 2% pullback 2.3 2.25% pullback very very normal even though it kind of just happened to coincide with the start of the year um you know I've been going on record saying that unless we break some key metrics here meaning this trend line right here this pivot High here is the one I'm watching right so we put a line in there you can see how you kind of hammered it and then broke out out as long as price on the S&P stays above basically 4600 I think the S&P actually I'm in the camp now that the S&P could actually make a run at 5,000 before we really see a bigger move to the downside now if it violates and breaks below 4600 then that's off the table but again you know it's just right now it's your run-of-the-mill pullback and we're starting to creep up already yeah I mean I guess I guess we'll see I I don't really have a strong opinion on the short-term price action I've I think think uh flows are bullish until next week and then seasonality tends to not be that great for the S&P so at least for the first like couple of months like if you were to look at um here here's a really interesting chart of of year-to dat or sorry this is the wrong um there there's a really interesting chart that I we we've looked at a few times right but it's that year-to-date Roi of of things like the S&P and what I've what I've seen a lot of times we we spent a lot of time looking at like pre-election year results uh this is 2024 so far um and if you add on the average of all election years this is kind of how it looks like so it's it's it's really currently it's a lot weaker than all you know the average of all prior election years but when you look at all prior election years you can see that you know there there's it just chops around for the most part right like there's not there hasn't really been a clear direction for the first like three months three three to four months of the year on average um and and one of the reasons for that is because election years you know if you think four of the last five recessions occurred in election years and so when you're overlaying things like 2020 onto the chart and and 2008 and and and 2000 you know these are the years that that really make it so that election years on average don't look as good as pre-election years interesting interesting um what are your thoughts on uh on where we're headed in like do you have any medals kind of thought processes we know Gold's been kind of hammering on uh a breakout level it keeps getting rejected I can show my gold chart real quick here so here's your daily gold chart and again you know we're still hammering on this level this 2075 2080 level but it still hasn't been able to break through are you expecting would you expect it to break out yeah I think I would expect it to ultimately break out if there is some type of of larger pullback in the S&P this year which I think we probably will see um because I I think we will get yield curve un verion at some point and that there's going to be a reason for that often times when that sort of stuff happens I think gold can get an initial pullback but it's it tends to be a lot quicker to to move back up once QE returns than risk assets do right because when people go risk off a lot of times that that means going into things like you know gold or cash or you know things like that so yeah I mean I gold can have pullbacks but I I'm I'm still in the camp that that gold will probably break to the upside this year even if there is sort of and again like look at last cycle right with in um you know 2019 there there there were always some pullbacks but it eventually it it eventually broke out you know it eventually it finally it it it made that move and then when I mean even when you look at like the the March 2020 crash remember like stocks stocks and a lot of at risk assets were putting in new lows gold had a pullback but it was just a higher low right it was just a higher low it wasn't it wasn't nearly as bad for gold as it was for like the S&P so yeah I'm in the camp that it'll it'll likely just keep on on on trending up could get a pretty big shake out but I I would still generally expect higher lows yeah and one thing I just wanted to show too is this is the chart on gold again um but what we could see back in 2014 15 16 17 18 19 is you had very similar price action and that you kept on hammering on the at that point it was the 1370 is area over and it got rejected over it got rejected rejected rejected literally you know five six times here but then you got the breakout and one once that happened it was a pretty sharp quick move up to that 2,000 and change level and so the concept is is now you're hammering again on this and and at some point if you do break out meaning you you close above let's say 2080 or 2100 you get that bigger move I I think you know potentially to about 2500 yeah yeah I mean and I I think gold will probably outperform silver as well uh for for at least a little while and then maybe maybe later on in QE maybe silver the the gold silver ratio start to go back the other way but I'm I'm still in the camp that that gold will outperform me too yeah sorry buddy I didn't mean to cut you off but yeah one of the things on Silver that I think you know investors need to recognize is that it be it's become more and more of an industrial metal and to me at least it's kind of gotten away a little bit from a store of safety as it's being used more and more industrially so I I do agree with you I think that that in the near term silver could underperform because it's not the pure play anymore the Pure Play for safety is gold um versus a a recession or something worse would affect the demand for silver but long term I do agree that I think eventually silver breaks out as well what are your views on on um I was gonna ask you like because on like lower market cap stuff like the Russell and and that sort of stuff because that that stuff had a pretty big surge at the end of the at the end of the year but they've it's had a pretty large pullback over the last uh couple of weeks and you know I'd be curious to to get your thoughts on on the Russell yeah so the Russell you're right I mean amazing end ofe surge I think there was a a combination of of effects that drove the Russell up I think it went up like 26% from just in late October into the year end and those those factors were this is when when you had a lot of the other tech stocks the Magnificent 7 already up tremendously people just naturally start looking for where's where are things on sale right it's hard to pay up on Microsoft and on Apple at the you know Apple at the 200 level we've know we know it's pulled back already so what they did was they said okay well what hasn't run let's run this into year end and then I also think the The Narrative of a soft Landing interest rates coming down remember that the Russell is made up of a lot of companies that are smaller H therefore they're not profitable they have to borrow money borrowing costs when interest rates are skyh high are death you know for these type of companies so if expectations are that interest rates start to drop then the Russell stocks do a lot better so I think that's a combination now looking at the chart there was a Downs sloping trend line we broke out of so on a shortterm basis you buy the retrace to the scene of the crime which is if the Russell dumps out to 186 187 that's a buying opportunity it broke out if it comes back here this now becomes support the only thing that would get me scared on the Russell and it may happen this year in fact I do think eventually it does is this trend line from the low of covid to this pivot low going back to November of 2023 if that gets broken to the downside that would be big trouble for you know that would be a significant breakdown but right now um at least and again keep in mind I'm looking at a much shorter time frame I'm looking you know one month out or so if this did pull back I would be a buyer for a quick trade to the upside yeah the Russell is I you know I I I drew this I drew this potential path out like I don't know if you remember but I drew this out like six months ago yeah um and and I don't know if it's going to play out but it's basically just sort of like an acknowledgement that you have your you know sure your your your your midterms year your 2014 your 2018 your 2022 and in both both of those years you know the Russell had a bare Market basically like it it it it went down and then in your your pre-election years it surged back to the upside and then the election year it it cratered and then I I do wonder if it's going to repeat that and it kind of makes sense when I when I think about it because you know why would these lower market cap stocks start to do well again when QE comes back right and what better time to start QE than in an election year where there's going to be a lot more political pressure to do so so I I I would be curious like if if it does break those trend lines that you were that you were drawing out like if it if it you know doesn't hold those that I'd be curious because in all of these prior cases it was a lower low right it was a low and then a lower low and then a low and then a lot of times you know the S&P didn't even put in a lower low in 2016 it was a higher low but the Russell put in a lower low and I I I'm curious to see if something like that will play out again and then once the FED goes back to QE that's when this really starts to get get strong again and starts to go on another larger run are you are you thinking that um are you in the camp that we'll see a recession before this year is out like we will slip into a recession look I I mean I think there's a decent chance of it um I mean I I think it's it's foolish to say one way or another like definitive League like nothing has to happen um you know it but it certainly seems like there's indicators suggesting that the FED is behind the curve like there you know job openings are going down the ism Services looks pretty bad I know the unemployment rate is still relatively low but it is starting to curl to the upside when you look at sort of the macro Trend um so it's hard to say I mean it's it's really hard to say predicting the the the the time that these business Cycles take to play out is is honestly a Fool's erend in my opinion you know like I I don't know how long it's going to take but I will say there are enough indicators out there that suggest that there is weakness in the economy and and that it's you know it could hit us in 2024 uh sometime before the elections and and give the you know give the fed the excuse to start printing again because you know yeah I have to believe that the politicians don't want to go into an elections with interest rates at five and a half percent and and delinquencies on the on the on the Move higher and I think that's that's an important factor too to to point out is like you know we've talked about you know credit card debt North of a trillion you know people def in default left and right business bankruptcies are are at their highest levels I think since 2012 and so so there's lots like you said lots of stresses we talked about that ISM number as well and lots of other economic data um I did read something over the weekend and I'll get more information on it but banks are now holding 33% of the the the money that's invested in bonds if you will that banks are holding is now underwater which is even F even more than during the financial crisis I think it was about % during the financial crisis and a lot of this is tied to the commercial real estate market right commercial real estate is crumbling uh in terms of valuations and there's a lot of and this is goes back to kind of the term that I I I used months ago in last March called Zombie Banks where because the FED kind of did away with losing your money in Banks so you're not going to get the bank runs which allows them to keep operating but if you go under the hood of a lot of these Banks there's a lot of dead paper there man a lot of losses and and again I don't know when that all gets Unwound or or how it comes out but uh but these type of things you have to be as an investor smart um do your due diligence you know risk assess I think risk assess is a key thing for for investors overall and just be aware man be aware that under the belly of this Market is a lot of of negative stuff out there yeah and and just for clarity for everyone I mean you know with the S&P it's not like I my investments in that are just based on risk metrics you know I'm not I'm not trying to time anything there it's more just like a boring DCA into the into the in the into the index as long as the risk level is low but yeah I think we should uh wrap it up where it's been about 30 minutes guys if you're not subscribed to Gareth make sure you do that all the links to his channels and his website down in the description below a lot of great stuff over there check it out yeah same thing same thing for Ben by the way guys you know follow him he knows his stuff as you can see his charts are absolutely phenomenal his dat is phenomenal um so make sure you follow him and we will be next back next Monday at 11: am you guys have a good one see you guys",Youtube video,2024-01-08 00:00:00,"The discussion focuses on the technical analysis of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. The analysts highlight the potential impact of the upcoming Bitcoin spot ETF approval, noting that there is a divide on whether it will lead to a surge or a sell-off in Bitcoin. They also discuss the dominance of Bitcoin over altcoins, observing that altcoins have been underperforming and are vulnerable to pullbacks.The analysts provide a detailed analysis of the Ethereum-Bitcoin pair, suggesting that Ethereum could see a further decline towards the 0.003-0.04 range before finding a macro higher low. The conversation also covers the broader economic outlook, with concerns about weakening employment data and the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, potentially leading to a recession.The discussion delves deeper into the Russell index, noting its strong surge at the end of 2022 and the subsequent pullback. The analysts suggest that a pullback to the 186-187 level could present a buying opportunity, but caution that a breakdown of the long-term trend line from the COVID-19 lows would be a significant bearish signal.The overall sentiment expressed is cautiously bullish on Bitcoin and gold, while bearish on the broader stock market in the near term. The analysts emphasize the importance of risk assessment and due diligence for investors, given the underlying stresses in the financial system, such as the high levels of commercial real estate-related losses in the banking sector.",293,"[0.056884766, 0.01033783, -0.006298065, -0.039154053, 0.01878357, -0.020980835, 0.015686035, -0.022201538, 0.0039634705, 0.013793945, 0.005493164,

Hi, welcome to 2024 the first NFA live of 2024 or not Financial advice we're going to get this thing going every week again I know we took a break we tend to do that around the holiday season um but we're happy to be back how are you guys doing great how's things pretty good guy yeah yeah I'm good I'm good happy New Year to to both of you and to everyone watching you yeah happy to be here and guys if you're not if you're not subscribed to either of these um either of their channels we got Rob from digital asset news the link to his channel is in the description below uh he's in the top right and then guy from coin bureo we have a link to his channel in the description below or coin buau Clips I imagine if you're subscribed to either Rob or I you're fully aware and subscribe to coin Bureau but you might not be subscribed to coin buau Clips so make sure you go subscribe to that uh I guess they do a lot more of their their live streaming and and that sort of stuff so um we're happy to be back we're going to talk about a lot of different things today the main things we'll talk about are sort of takeaways from 2023 we'll talk a little bit about 2024 um I guess I I guess we have to talk about uh the spot ETF stuff uh because it's kind of like it seems like we're we're sort of into the crescendo of of some type of resolution and uh we'll talk a little bit about about the altcoin market so uh let's go ahead and start off I I I'm curious like you know as we look back on on 2023 what's your biggest takeaway from it I mean it was a it was a it was a crazy year um in a lot of regards so I'm curious Rob what is your what are your views and and sort of takeaways from from 2023 I should have listened to you on the Bitcoin thing that's for sure I remember in 20122 I went a little bit uh a little bit too crazy and I think if I would have stuck with Bitcoin I would have done better but one of the of the things that I I would say in 2023 was that stick to your plan because you know how some people will say some people believe in in the four-year cycles and some people don't like Bob Lucas again who I really like his channel a lot of great information very smart gentleman but he's like I don't think it really plays that big of a difference into it and he says it's all cycles and it's all ta and it's all people and I can get that but I got to tell you the fouryear Cycles have held up and the plan always is then is you know if if you want to start investing uh I think this I mean of course the the best time would be at the the ultimate bottom and of course put everything that you possibly have in the in the bottom but who the heck is able to do that I'm sure someone in the comment section will say I did it Rob I was awesome I I sold everything and I bought salana at nine bucks and I bought Bitcoin at 167 sure but yeah stick to your plan and just start to move forward and then another thing that that that not surprisingly but your time Horizon and I think this is this something I don't talk enough about on my channel which is if your time Horizon is short it's very tough to make it in any type of investment and in any kind of like either it's a real estate or precious metals or equities or crypto if your time Horizon is you know one week two weeks a month it's very difficult unless you're like a super Trader which I'm not but if you just just zoom out and then have this this four-year mentality I got to tell you if we would talk to the people that don't believe in crypto in a four-year time frame I think everybody would get on board especially if you compare that to everything that's gone up as far as inflation hous prices and everything else so my big takeaway was uh was that and then also uh don't fade meme coins because uh they seem to have a place in this ecosystem so that was some of them yeah no I mean it's it's great I think there's there's all sorts of things to learn and the meme coins have have their own personality that's for sure um guy what about you I mean I I know there's we look back on on 2023 what are your what are your takeaways I think always you know when you get to a new year it's interesting to sort of think back to the prior year yeah and to think back to where you were this time last year because I do remember early 2023 pretty well because you know all that time you know in the wake of FTX it was it was you know a real kind of heightened sense of of everything um and I think Rob yeah I I I I agree with you on on everything you said there and I think that time Horizon thing especially is is really important and I think crypto really Fosters a sort of short-term thinking and meme coins play into that you know this idea that you can literally make you know 10 times your money 100x your money almost overnight and yeah it it patience and and getting your time hariz and right is is so important um but yeah I think for my my big takeaways from 23 I think the the the biggest one was just how resilient this sector is now um and the reason I say that is because I've noticed a couple of articles in I think there was one in Bloomberg uh and there was another one that I saw yesterday in The Spectator which is a um a sort of magazine back in the UK it's it's it's sort of on on the kind of right of the spectrum but not you know not um fully on the right but you know mainstream Publications and talking about how both both had articles uh talking about how Bitcoin in particular has has rebounded after after last year after the lows that we saw you know post FTX and that's you know that's a big thing that that's a big thing that I've I've really noticed you know from 2023 this sector is so resilient now you can throw this you know one catastrophe after another from sort of you know in 2022 um and yet that you know we've pulled out of it and now we now that the talk is of a is is of a new uh bull market starting and you know the the sentiment is turning around obviously that's been really helped by uh by the speculation around ETFs which we'll which we'll get to in a moment um but yeah it the the resilience of the sector and the fact that it's been able to ride out this High interest rate environment because I think this was something we were talking about a lot uh this time last year you know Bitcoin crypto in general faces that was facing this big test how is it going to react in a high interest rate environment well Bitcoin went up you know plus 150% so that you know we had we had our answer there and I think that was a huge test um that the sector has passed so so there's that uh another takeaway is that justice prevails albeit slowly um I'm thinking you know some of the main character baddies uh are now you know slowly starting to face Justice s SPF is one obviously uh mazinsky goes on trial before too long things seem to be catching up with the guys from 3ac Etc um dquan is uh you know is slowly being brought to justice so these kind of main character bad guys from from last time around are slowly being uh you know slowly uh getting their just deserts and you know the wheels of Justice do turn albeit slowly so that's another takeaway and um something that someone mentioned when we were talking about this uh a few days ago it is this thing is um uh I think it goes back to Warren Buffett's quote doesn't it when there's when there's blood on the streets that's the time to buy but yeah when everyone gets bearish it's time to be bullish and I wish I'd paid more attention to that I wish I'd been I wish I'd remember that lesson in the wake of FTX you know I wish I'd remembered that this time last year because as you know as you say that that would be the T that would be the time to buy soul at $9 um so yeah you you always you always get reminded of of these lessons that that are pretty enduring right no I think it's good good Reflections um and I I always look back on the year and think about like how you know certain things panned out in ways that we thought in ways that we thought would and how other things didn't and it's just kind of a good good way to reset and and to get your mind in the right space and sort of thinking about that I mean now that we're in 2024 I'm curious what are going to be the big crypto narratives this year you know because I mean it's hard to always think about it ahead of time and and a lot of times the big narratives end up being something that we're not necessarily expecting I don't really think we went into 2023 like I don't I don't really think at the very beginning of 2023 we went into it thinking that everyone was going to be talking about you know spot ETFs all year um uh that sort of St so I'm curious like what do you think will be Rob I'll start with you like what do you think the the big narratives for 2024 as it relates to to crypto will be I well besides the Bitcoin ETF which should really rocket the price of uh of Bitcoin going up I think some of the narratives will be also around Bitcoin as well like if you take a look at like the smart contracts layer which would be something like with Stacks or ordinals layer or layer like or which I know like some of the Bitcoin Maxes absolutely despised but it's here and you need to deal with it and that's the reason why the the rates have gone so high but also I think because of the Crackdown by uh friend of the show Gary gendler just kidding and the things that he that he's done and uh the legal aspect I think the centralized exchanges are facing an uphill battle even if they play ball so I think the next narrative will be dexas and dexas have come a long way when we got in remember the first Dex you guys used it was an erc20 it was ethereum right it's probably Unis swap I'm guessing and then it was a little bit clunky a little bit slow and it got ridiculously expensive moving forward I mean if if we Tak a look at like at like uh Jupiter for which is the the salana decks you can you can trade and swap everything on there and it's less than a penny and it's almost instantaneous and then also Trader Joe which is from from Avalanche so I think that the next narrative will be dex's because it'll be easier I think the next narrative also I mean Nar that we should all focus on is cold storage devices so we don't get screwed over like the FTX is the Voyer the Celsius and the blockfi guy just did a great video which he compared all the different Cold Storage wallet devices and I think if you can have that with the dexes you can also have ai plays whatever those may be hypercycle render stuff like that and then also of course web three gaming and I know that uh I know people will say well web 3 gaming you know this the games kind of suck look look the games did suck in 2021 when they first rolled out I mean I think alium the token was over ,000 they didn't have a product out yet it was just pure speculation now the games that you see that people are playing and remember you need some of these utility tokens not every single one and not all are played or earn I think that's will be the next one because it gamers are going to game and there was a report by statista and and it took out look at all the different Gamers throughout globally and it was like 2.53 billion people that's everybody from the hardcore gamer to the people that just Bay like Candy Crush like my wife on her phone and those are the you know the types of things that people get into so for me I look at like AAC because there's a lot of gaming products built on Avalanche polygon and the layer twos arbitrum uh pirate Nation those type of things and then specifically for the actual tokens for the games like playable alium the games immutable X Ronin and pixels Cornucopia Nakamoto games there's another one I just am going to get into on on my channel it's called farana and it's coming out it's a free to play but you're going to get rewards in Bitcoin and it's uh actually it's being produced over where year in your neck of the woods so I think that's the next narrative moving forward everything combined and I think that we all got screwed over in 2021 with the manipulation that was going on with this the spfs and with the cels anything like that I think we got screwed out of a proper Bull Run I think this one's going to make up for the last one your answers are always so well thought out and and and rambling sorry no I think you always do your homework on them yeah um so I appreciate that I think everyone here probably appreciates that too um guy yeah I was just noticing some some positive comments about your responses and stuff uh guy what about you I mean like what are what are your what do you think the narratives will be for 2024 because I feel like I mean it's hard to think about it you know you know this far in advance right where you still have most of the year ahead of us but what do you think will be sort of the prevailing narrative as we go through through the year yeah yeah it's it's a great question and it's we we did a video on um on the main Channel about it recently so I'll run through a few of those but I think um I can't remember it was if it was you or Rob who said uh just now but you know I think a some of these some of these narratives um are probably not even here yet or not even really being talked about yet so um I think that's something to be that's something to keep in the back of you know in the back of your mind the big Narrative of 2024 a bit like the big sort of potential uh you know Black Swan or you know major negative Catalyst of 2024 if it's happened you know is is something that perhaps no one is is aware of yet no one is talking about um I think a good example of that like I've noticed that people are now starting to talk about reaking um and I think enan laay is is a is is the sort of big project in that regard certainly the big you know project on ethereum in that regard um you know this idea of using using staked eth to secure other chains you know that I've this seems I mean I I I remember people talking about igen lay sort of maybe late last year um but that now seems to be coming to the four but you know that's only just in the last sort of few weeks that I've or even few days that I've really started to hear talk around that being a narrative so I think that's a good example of one that could just be you know just be emerging um Rob Rob's uh Rob talking about gamey I I agree with that I think gamef fire has huge potential to be a big narrative this cycle um this was one of the ones that we that we talked about in our video and uh I think yeah this idea that last time around these games weren't so hot and you know now we are starting to see some some really goodlooking games games that I think you know the important thing is is for the people playing them not to even necessarily have to be aware that this is a blockchain game it's just a cool game you know it doesn't matter that it's running off this particular chain or that particular chain or that you're getting nfts those loot boxes are nfts doesn't matter so if game play is is if the game play is awesome then that's what you know that's the the really important thing I think the only the only tricky thing I think with the gamey narrative and and Rob sort of demonstrated this is that there's so much Choice out there there are so many different ways that you can approach it you know do you invest in the underlying blockchains you know Avalanche uh immutable Etc or do you go for individual projects and protocols and things like that and I think you know it's such a it's such a growing um ecosystem I think it could be tricky to you know necessar because unless you're unless you want to try and invest in everything which is not something I'd generally recommend so I think that's the only uh perhaps downside to gamefire is you know it's going to be perhaps harder to pick a winner um I think maybe you could say the same for AI as well um this is a niche that I think you know a lot of people again are talking about there are already AI projects emerging um and this is one that we definitely think could be could be a big narrative but again which one is it going to be you know and um you know which which AI projects are the ones that are going to actually offer something you know offer a genuine use case genuine fundamentals and which ones are just sort of going yeah yeah we're AI um because they they understand they understand the power of narrative and they understand that people will ape into like they did last year I think it was was it Autumn last year when they or or or summer last year when the uh when the AI narrative kicked off and all these AI tokens went crazy and a lot of them were just you know just had AI in there somewhere um and it was hard to it was hard to tell what exactly they were offering yeah um yeah sorry Rob you were gonna you were gonna say something no I just agree with you I remember it was the same thing in the Doom era I think it was Lipton IC tea put like lipton.com and their stock went up like 200% in one night it was just because of Doom era the same thing with AI so be careful yeah yeah yeah um so yeah gamey AI uh reaking um there's now talk around deep in this this idea of decentralized physical infrastructure um that again is one that seems to be emerging seems to have just really started emerging in the last couple of weeks or so uh so that's an interesting one to watch and of course our old favorites things like memes you know memes I think is going to be a narrative again because that's just it's just seems to be a more and more fundamental part of crypto and actually on the topic of memes I listened today on my way into work I was listening to uh Arthur Hayes being interviewed by Laura Shin on her um podcast on Unchained and he had a really interesting take on memes you know sort of along the lines of you know people have been watching um central banks print money you know on and on and on and memes is kind of their way of is you know this the crypto the crypto generation way of kind of sticking two fingers up to them and go this is what we think of your feared you know this is what we think of this worthless money that you keep printing we're gonna throw it into dog frog you know dog with Hats themed coins and you know it's it's a kind of an expression of an expression of contempt with uh the fat system which I think is I think there's there's a lot to be said for that yeah I mean I I do appreciate you guys talking about these narratives because I honestly haven't kept up with it I think nearly as much as you guys have so it's it's really interesting to hear um you know what you guys think will be sort of the prevailing narratives in 2024 because um it's you know there's there's just so many different ways it could go and again there's a good chance we get to the end of 2024 for and as guy said there's something that no one is even thinking about right now that will that will sort of come up and and change the trajectory of of the discussions for the year um but I guess the the first thing to sort of get out of the way in potentially early 2024 as soon as January is one of Rob's favorite topics and that's the spot ETF I think you have a I think you had a bet going with someone right Simon Dixon so so the bet is I don't think it's going to be approved I said this a long time ago and I said but if it is approved I will wear this t-shirt that says ihart Alex mashinsky or ihart masinski like okay so you think it'll eventually be approved right like yeah yeah no it'll eventually like it's not like forever it'll be in the Wasteland it's just Gary's kind of Gary's the Gary's the final boss in this game and if we can be defeat Gary we're good but to some degree I think a lot of people thought it was going to be approved last year and now and it hasn't and now it's 2024 so I guess when does it when does your view shift from you know it it not happening to are you talking about like in the next round of applications or something maybe next rounds but see you got understand like I am the 0 one% that still says you got to show me the money and everybody else is like Rob and trust me I read my comments and I know how dumb I am because you tell me how dumb I am but but everybody here's a thing it may be approved it may not be approved I don't and and of course you've got Eric balunis from uh I think he's the one of the ETF experts and he's just saying like look they're doing all the things in place and it's going to be approved they've met with the SEC the SEC has actually met with NASDAQ they' filed all the right paperwork and it's going to go through I'm like that's great I hope it does because if it does we're all G to be you know living the high life I don't know if it even if it does get approved you have to understand that it's not like the next day everybody just dumps 10 trillion dollars into it it's going to take time because all the the armies that are in Black Rock and Fidelity and Arc Investments they've already talked to to their big investors but to get it into the hands of everybody that takes a lot of marketing and it takes a a lot of bit of redirection so I hope it does but I've been hearing this because I'm maybe I'm just Shell Shocked PTSD but I heard this in 2017 I heard it in 2018 19222 I heard in 2023 it going to happen before January and now I'm he that it was supposed to happen on Tuesday and that didn't happen and then yesterday all of a sudden there was an article which kind of dropped the the price some people say that it was the article some people to say it's whales moving whatever it is so now it's January 10th so if it's January 10th great I'll wear the shirt with pride and be like hey here's my stupid shirt and I was wrong and I'm happy I'm wrong because my because my portfolio is crushing it and that's all that matters but again you have to understand even if it doesn't happen the narrative is shift even crazy Kramer's been out there saying that you can't kill Bitcoin so I mean it just it doesn't really matter if it gets approved or not the direction is inevitable guy what what do you think about it I mean seems like we're knocking on the door of the uh of the window here and and sort of follow up like if it is approved do you think that other ones will follow up like you know other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and and whatever else yeah I I think first of I think it's great that um that we've got you know Rob offering that opinion there Rob I think you I I think you'll be wrong and um you know I hope you are wrong I hope I think it's I think it's great that you know there there are that we've got someone there just as a as a kind of voice of reason because I think it's so easy to get carried away with you know the certainty of it all um and I think it's I think it's good to be reminded that there is a chance uh that they will try and that they will try and block this Gary gendler is the final boss after all I think I think that's a great analogy Rob I did want to ask you as well do you think though like do you think if Gary gendel is the final boss do you think if we if we beat him if we if we defeat him on this this time round you know in the next few days there might be that sort of sense of uh emptiness that you get after completing a game and it's sort of like oh it's over now do now there's just like in the in the good old days of playing double Dragon once you once you beat beat the final boss there's another boss behind it it's the shadow boss and that shadow boss is Elizabeth Warren and and and apparently the whole Biden Administration and I'm not going to get political but let's be honest it's not like the administration loves crypto so we'll see how it works out going forward but no there's always somebody to beat there's always somebody else out there there's always land to to go through it'll be a good good win we'll find another enemy trust me another enemy another enemy will find us I think EX um I think they've already found us um yeah so so to go back to your question Ben um yeah I think in the wake of a of a spot spot Bitcoin ETF approval I mean there's already talk about spot eth ETFs as well eth is slightly more of a gray area from a regulatory standpoint uh so I think I think the I think it could be a while yet before we see spot e ETFs but there does seem to be the momentum there I mean we're already seeing we've already seen um applications filed haven't we before you know before the actually long before uh you know a few weeks ago a few months ago even so um that I think is I I'm I'm I hesitate to say a spot EF is inevitable but it is beginning to it is beginning to get that sense of it's the next sort of logical step after the approval of a of a spot Bitcoin ETF and then I mean I've seen speculation regarding ETF for for for other cryptos I mean I think James saart who's the other sort of Bloomberg analyst who's been the sort of uh main character throughout all this with with um Eric balunas I think he I was trying to find it I was trying to find this tweet earlier but I think he tweeted out not so long ago uh he was sort of he kind of dispelled some of this speculation around a soul ETF because I think know people are already starting to talk about that now because of because of everything that's happened with salana over the last few weeks um that I think may be you know according to according to these experts that may be a little while off but who knows I think you know it the the spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States will be such a big uh will be such a big milestone I think it will be a Rubicon that's crossed um and I think eth eth next at some point maybe later this year maybe 2025 um and then I mean we we have seen the likes of um you know I think we have seen in interest from the likes of the uh from the likes of the CME for um you know I think they added reference rates for salana and and cardano I think back in 2022 I think so you know that we could see Futures listings for for for sa and Ada in the in the in the future and That Could That Could lead to ETFs further down the line but I don't want to get too ahead of ourselves but uh yeah I think it's I think the spot Bitcoin ETF will be um you know will be a kind of launch pad for for for more of these products in the future for different cryptos yeah I mean I have to think at some point they'll have like ETFs that just track you know the top kind of like you have ETFs that'll track like say like the S&P 500 or um like various sectors right you know I do think that at some point I mean you know you'll have an ETF that that tracks say like the top 25 cryptocurrencies right um which would probably be a successful product long term um because there's a lot of people that don't frankly they don't want to to bother you know going out and buying all the individual coins but they they'd be willing to track it and you know I I think it's important for us to remember and and say that you know not your keys not your crypto so you know the Spy DTF stuff is is certainly a great narrative and I'm sure eventually it will lead to more money coming into space but it still doesn't change the fact that if do buy the ETF um you are essentially you don't you don't own your keys right and furthermore beyond that um you're gonna be paying a fee you know like so that's that's something too and and I just want people to to to remember that they know they will take some some of those basis points off the top if you're fine with that then that's you know that's that's your own decision but I I think my official Position will has been and will continue to be not your keys not your crypto and um you know that's sort of the main the main reason that I think a lot of us are uh that a lot of us were were sort of brought to the to crypto in the first place besides you know the price besides the price action but also just the idea of hey this is something that you know you're they're not they're not going to freeze your Bitcoin right or or something if if something happens so just a reminder um the next thing I think we should talk about are so so we we of course have spoken about about altcoins already I know you guys mentioned a few um but you know over the last two years despite whatever despite whatever the haters want to say the Bitcoin dominance has gone up right so yeah I know I know go go go look at the yearly candles um uh the last two last two yearly candles for Bitcoin dominance were in fact green and um so but I I guess I'm curious uh what you guys think about about this year because it is a new year and and there's also no denying that altcoins have gained some ground on bitcoin since October um so I I guess I'm curious you know do you think that this the ground that these altcoins have gained you think it's like durable against Bitcoin and and again to be clear I'm not I'm not asking about their USD pairs because I don't really care about that I I'm asking about Bitcoin valuations of all points because it's always tricky you know knowing where that turning point is and I I'm you know I just I'm curious as to what you guys think you know in 2024 it is the having year it is the election year it's probably going to be the year of the FED pivot right so there there's a lot of things to think about and and and sort of think about those macro Trends so Guy where do you stand on on on on this sort of topic and I know it's a tough topic you know because it's it's tough but um so yeah I'm curious what your views are we should have a I think I've said this before we should have a a siren that goes off when the words Bitcoin and dominance are mentioned in that in that sequence um yeah I mean I think assuming assuming we see the ETF approved um you know this month or or March or whenever it comes I think we'll we'll we'll see we'll see that spike in in dominance so the question is in Bitcoin dominant so the question is can it maintain it um and I think you know these ETFs are likely to really change the kind of Market structure you know not only are they going to open up Bitcoin to a much a much wider pool of in of of investors and and capital but you know there's there's a good chance that that they they will end up being the way ways in which you know most of the Bitcoin in that that that moves is purchased so I think that could you know how that pans out I'm I'm not exactly sure um but I think we could I think we could definitely see a spike in uh in in Bitcoin dominance as a result and the question is how long it's how long it's it's able to uh to to maintain that Spike um will will altcoins then start to catch up and guess a big question is are PE how do people view Bitcoin and you know because there is this narrative around it's around BTC now and in it's largely sort of or for many people it's it's a savings vehicle you know Larry think called it this this flight to Quality didn't he so a kind of alt season is is in many ways predicated on the idea that people will take their profits from Bitcoin and you know Bank those profits and then move them into WS so my question is in in in regards to bitcoin dominance you know is this going to happen are people going to sell are enough people going to want to take profit on bitcoin um and then you know throw that into the altcoin market or is are we going to see people more speculating with Fiat moving Fiat into the into the altcoins into altcoins and and hodling BTC um because I think you know like I say this the this idea of Bitcoin as as digital gold or whatever you want to call it this seems to be pretty strong um whether or not a hand you know a handful of whales who've got such large amounts of BTC it's it's you know they they don't have to worry about hodling it you know whether they will be enough you know them taking profits and going into altcoins will be enough to cause a full-blown Al season and affect that you know affect that dominance ratio I'm not sure sure um so I think yeah it will be it will be fascinating to see uh whether you know whether the majority of this Bitcoin gets huddled or whether do people do in in fact decide to to take profits from it and go into ws and I I can see it going either way yeah I mean history definitely has certain examples but it's hard to know right every cycle seems to have its own personality and characteristics to it um Rob what do you think I mean I mean I know it's your favorite topic man so I'll let you have the floor you know you should do a video on it I I think people would need to to understand what this is all about now I want I want other I want other it's a new year I want to hear what other people think about it because you know it's I I have my views of course but I also I I also could see the narrative shifting at some point this year especially if we get a Fed pivot if it wasn't for if it wasn't for the spotty F coming through I would say maybe we wouldn't see a big Bitcoin dominance you know rally but let's take a look where where the big money is retails retail's done its job right and we know that institutions are here and they're buying up what are they doing they're they're pretty much front running everybody they're getting it in and they're trying to get it but they can't get as many as like the big people the family offices as they need to until they get this approval from the stamp approval from the SEC regardless if you think well you know there was a spot ETF in Canada that didn't do so well well unfortunately I'm sorry to say it's Canada and the most of the money here is the United States I know Canadians hate me but that's just the truth so if if we just take a look at where the money is and where it's going to flow into if if the ETF comes through now you have an army of these people that work for the black rocks and the Fidelity and the arc investment and they're just convincing everybody to go in and then once once they say oh this isn't uh hold on this isn't for terrorists and this isn't for the cartel because Elizabeth Warren said it was but you're telling me it's not no no no it's really good it's great great as a matter of fact it's the best thing you can actually do it's it's the most outperforming asset in the last 12 years I think you should really get into it maybe two to 3% and if you really want to be risky maybe 5 per. now put that in everybody's every billionaire Millionaire's wallet or portfolio and see what happens so I think it could do and there's a reason why gold has a market cap of 11.5 12 trillion dollar it's because that was the same narrative it's you want to hedge against inflation well this is it and then people will take a look at Bitcoin and say it's not a hedge against inflation it just went down here's a good example I heard this from Preston pish was a really good one he said because we're talking about real estate you take a house in 2020 right before Co Corona virus came about let's say it's a half a million dollars and then in two years three years now it's worth a million dollar and then of course now of course the rate went from 2.75 to 3% all the way up to 7.75% so you're telling me that it's two or three times the cost for that house you know how much that house would have cost you in business Bitcoin back in 2020 I think it was like 228 Bitcoin now you know how much that that million dollar house will cost you roughly I think it's like 4752 Bitcoin something like that huh it really is actually a hedge against inflation and what they start once they start to explain that even to me because I love real estate I took a look at that if you tell all the real estate Bros and the and the uh precious metal guys and all the different traditional equities and go this is where you should be I think it's going to really jump and then if we keep having more hacks and more problems and more rug Poes and altcoins which there's no shortage of that we have an issue rugs exactly so like when when you talk about people getting into it if the big money comes in it's not how much money they make it's how much they can actually keep and I think Mark cuan learned that with iron finance and and all the different rug pulls that he went through so I think it's going to go into Bitcoin I don't can't really say how much I think the dominance will go up but of course People Like Us and other people will say well maybe what about this what about this Dogecoin what about this Bonk what about this that's fine because I do that same thing too so that's my that's my assessment yeah I mean like even in even in 2023 even though dominance went up there are still plenty of altcoins that outperform Bitcoin just like there're always there always have been and just like there always will be um but it's yeah it's interesting trying to trying to get the general overall trend right guys if you have any questions uh in the chat for either guy or Rob um I think now would be the a good time to do so we might ask one more question here um but yeah if you guys have any questions that you want to answer we got about maybe 15 20 more minutes left the last question that I was gonna say and and maybe I I can sort of take this when guy guy wants to provide some commentary on it but um I'm curious about you know a Fed pivot you it seems like seems like this is the year that a Fed pivot is going to occur at least the markets are certainly pricing that in um guy you have any opinion on on a Fed P you think you think this of the Year they'll actually start to cut rates I I think you've been pretty I'd say I think you've been pretty spoton with with sort of your views on on at least you know when we talked about interest rates for a Fed I think you you know I said you thought they were going to stop at around five and a half and and hold there for a while so yeah like what are what are your views here uh now that we're in 2024 well I mean I think mostly you know we've be we've been sort of just kind of paying close attention to what uh to what's coming out of um you know the fed and what Jerome pal says because he seems to have you know he seems to have done what he said he was going to do um so I mean the FED certainly I hesitate to say seems Keen to cut because that might be a little premature but the F you know the dock plot um that we that we saw recently expects at least three rate Cuts this year and that's not the market you know of course you know to remind people that's the Dot Plot is not the market The Dot Plot it's not the see you know um it's not the CME or whatever it's the um it's what the FED members actually themselves think so I think it's I think a pivot this year is is more than likely um whether we see that I mean the first meeting is in J is at the end of this month I don't think we'll see a cut then but I mean I think there is a good chance that they might start looking to cut at the at the next meeting in March um whenever it happens I think it I think it will happen um and the question is uh perhaps you know are they waiting for you know is there a crisis um that's going to come along and kind of force their hand because as as we've pointed out I think when we've discussed this before generally when the fed or other central banks for that matter cut interest rates it's because they have to uh in response to you know in response to a crisis and you know the the the the pandemic was was a great example of that and there are many others um so there's that and I think also when when you to go back to talking about the FED uh obviously as um uh as one of you guys mentioned earlier this year is this year is an election year so will they look to cut will there be political pressure from the from the current Administration uh to make a cut in interest rates prior to the election um you know I I'm sure there is political pressure on the Fed so um yeah and and of course there is a kind of there is a worst case scenario I think certainly for for certainly for Jerome poell and the FED a worst case scenario um that's worth considering is that they lower interest rates and then inflation comes back and this whole nightmare starts again Jerome Jerome and Co have been very very uh you know forthright with saying that they intend to intend to beat inflation and we've talked I think before about you know him being a sort of successor to to Paul vulker in that way you know making sure that inflation is crushed which would suggest I think these rate Cuts will probably come along a little later in the year because I think they'll want to they've been very clear about how they're watching the data I think they'll want to see you know at least a few more months of data to really satisfy themselves that inflation is is dwindling you know it is in the downtrend um but I don't see how you know a few more months of data uh could hurt you know to to to Really help them make that decision so yeah I think it's a question of at what point this year and my guess is there's a there's a chance we could see it in March but I I think maybe perhaps more towards the summer as we get nearer to the uh nearer to the election in the United States yeah I think may I think uh March and then May and then there there's another meeting in June and July so I mean seems like in one of those meetings they'll they'll start to cut rates just to to get ahead of some of all the lagged effects of the rate hikes um because I think the average the average sort of the median time for a pause is about eight months and eight months would put us in March with for the for the First Rate cut if if it plays out on average but most Cycles don't play out on average right they play out you know and then we get the average from those but all right let me um let me go to the questions uh in the chat and I I think we actually got quite a lot of questions um looks like someone says Plan B just released a new video all right that should be should be interesting to to go take a look at it's always good stuff yeah um I I mean I think it's the stock to flow model is certainly an interesting model to to follow for sure um all models are wrong some are useful that's right yeah so you know it it just goes to show you like you know no one's going to get 100% correct so like just because someone gets it wrong on something doesn't mean they're wrong for everything and then it's a vice versa just because somebody gets one thing right doesn't mean you know or it doesn't mean that they're like perfect yeah that model didn't play out but I mean thinking back to it the the the thinking behind it was in the large part in in large part pretty sound I think I think there's I think it could easily have played out perhaps but it just didn't the market being the market yeah I mean I think also too there's a couple sort of a couple points sort of defend to sort of defend those views was one of which was that it went up kind of on that on the when he thought it was according to the model it just didn't go as high but I mean to be fair it didn't go as high as a lot of people thought it was gonna go you know um and I still remember you know like uh he put out a price prediction I think five months and like three months in a row he like nailed the exact price um and then it deviated the last two months but I you know I know people give them a hard time for that it's like you know like who among us is going to guess that the the monthly close of Bitcoin three months in a row you know it's not like it's not going to happen so um yeah I think it's I I when I said it I was being sincere I think I think it's you know I think it's really worthwhile to get everyone's opinion on things it's not you know it's a market right I think everyone always thinks they're right about things um and I fall into that trap sometimes but it's a market and it's good to see what other people are thinking um because if if they're thinking it there's a good chance that hundreds of thousands of other people are thinking the same thing um exactly exactly absolutely absolutely yeah let's keep going though because we we have a few more minutes um let me see uh a lot of people are just saying thanks um for for doing this uh someone says what do you guys think about all the aird drops going on so like I haven't been following the aird drops as much I remember last Cy um I was all about the air drops and and and you know partaking and all that stuff and and it was it was a lot of fun but frankly I haven't really done it this cycle uh it's hard to get aird drops when your entire portfolio is basically just you know your crypto portfolio is just Bitcoin I don't think I don't think satoshi's gonna be aird dropping me anything um but I mean for the for but I know you guys have have more so dabbled in that so I mean have there been I think I've seen on Twitter a lot of air drops been going on what you what do you guys think about it guy what do you got I mean I'm just yeah I'm I'm I'm cross with myself for missing out on I I missed out on uh on Celestia yeah one the cosmos ones I'm kicking myself for that um my interest fun fact my my brother-in-law is one of the biggest Deens you will ever meet he has he his crypto portfolio is just is something else um and he is airdrop farming like there is no tomorrow um and he's he's saying you know it's crazy out there there are so many um there are so many projects out there uh you know looking looking to airdrop and I think that's I think that's a sign that you know the market is that we're back that we're so we're so back airdropping these tokens again um you know there's there's excitement around around it I think it's I think it's it's a it's a positive indicator I mean it it it strikes me as a little bit of a fruy indicator perhaps it it suggests that maybe things are a little overheated people are getting all excited about this but maybe you know maybe I shouldn't be so cynical you know it it's great that these projects are are building and it's one of the it's one of the cool things about crypto isn't it they can just airdrop you free money for you know for using a protocol or for for staking you know for staking to secure a particular chain I think that I think that's is totally degenerate and it's it's completely awesome so good on him it is awesome I I'm I'm going to speak for most people I'm going to guess I would love to have your brother-in-law on your show and you interview him and ask him what the big djm plays is because that that that's really where it all comes down to I love to see that if you want to see that put a comment in the section or put a put put a comment in the comment section everybody I'm sure a guy would love to do it I'll I'll ask him I think he's I I I think he's a sort of you know I think he kind of keeps in the keeps in the background but may maybe I can persuade him maybe I can do uh I almost said his name there maybe I can do um my brother-in-law's uh guy aolly degenerate guide to airdrops just just do what just do what Ben did Ben interviewed Plan B for I remember one time and he just had had had the picture of Plan B but it wasn't his face it just it was his audio and you could do it like that yeah so there you go told you hey and everybody if you're looking for like like airdrop updates I don't really do too much on it but there's two people I follow kryptoo which I know I know guy you know and then Lady of crypto I think you know her too they do great stuff about air drops and there's another there's a website called interact in N T.O and they have all the different aird drops that are going on that you can get into one thing I will say is if you're going to do that stuff make sure you have a burner wallet make sure that the wallet that's that's uh your hot wallet is a totally new one and uh because there's a lot of things that go wrong with that yeah yeah there's there's an absolute ton of scan and that that is the big downside I think it's it's that's that's really important to flag up Rob that's the big downside of this airdrop season it's the scammers are out in full force and so you've got to be so careful you know you got to treat these things with with utmost suspicion um and it's about having it's about having all your senses all your anten ey you know flashing for these things because okay it is quote unquote free money but you know you've got if you get a if you get a if you get a a a a Twitter DM or whatever it is and you're like oh I'd no idea I'd been I was eligible for this chain that I for an airdrop from this chain that I've never used well guess what you're not you know you've got to you've got to do something for these airdrops so yeah do be uh do be careful someone says that uh coin bu coin buau dgen would be an amazing Channel amazing Channel I vote for that as a as a plug uh for guy they they do have coin Bureau club uh and I I wouldn't I wouldn't describe it as as Deen but I would describe it as as a place that you could get some useful information about about altcoins so uh guy how do they find that uh yeah there'll be a link uh there'll be a link to coin Bureau Club in the uh in the description of any of our videos either on Clips or the main Channel um and yeah we we have a Discord as well we have a general Discord but we have a sort of coin Bureau club members area in the Discord I can tell tell you there are some there are some Deens in that um they you know they're providing some uh they're providing some degeneracy if that's if that's what you're after but I think I think there are people there are people looking for degeneracy now it is I'd like to see Ben do uh into the cryptoverse Deen where he talks about salana and BNB I would watch that I would watch that I would subcribe to that I would I would buy a t-shirt of that just just tell me where oh yeah right there former life former life yeah smart play smart Play If I had had a YouTube channel two cycles ago I would be almost unrecognizable um last cycle I did do some videos on some smaller market cap stuff um but as I said before I probably will try to steer away from that for the most part this cycle um that doesn't mean I don't occasionally talk about it I mean I occasionally talk about about about the alt stuff but um it's an evolution it's a good it's a good one because not how much you make it's how much you keep and how many people we know have lost a boatload on crazy alts and memes and everything else I don't think have to worry about that I think I have like I mean I've said before I have like one% of my portfolio in other stuff than Bitcoin yeah but that that's about it um any other questions let's see um I think there were some some other ones that were um I'll definitely float coin Bureau D gen to to the team that's a good one that's hey guy guy I got I got something for you for corn Bureau djin Clum cbdc oh my goodness it has to happen that's great Panda oh brilliant CBC cbdc Live it's good red panda pie always always uh always comes out with the great comments red panda pie if you you know if you want to if if this is is a pitch for the job I I'll listen there was another question um there's a couple more how long do the quote unquote good alts usually run after Bitcoin highs is it is it a case of as soon as Bitcoin turns the whole Market does Rob what do you think I don't think so because like we're just taking a look at I again stole the stuff from your website we were doing I was just showing people how they haven't missed anything just aing from uh I think it was December 3rd I did the video from December 3rd 2020 to the all-time highs in 2021 I just showed people like you got a lot of time and you actually didn't miss anything of course you missed the bottoms but but then you could see like in April how like April I think it was April 11th 2021 where Bitcoin hit 60,000 and ethereum was only at like 1,900 so it hadn't really ran and then cardano hadn't hit its $3 price point and some other ones had but some some didn't I think the same thing happened in 2017 Bitcoin capped out around December 15 16 17th somewhere around there and then in January is when uh ethereum hit its all-time high over a grand so I don't think it it doesn't equal up Bitcoin usually tops out whatever you want to take a look at P Cycle top and vbz score multiple blah blah blah but then I then there's some that actually will run after that I think a lot of it depends on if Bitcoin like when it if it puts in new highs So like um like 2021 2020 2021 Bitcoin put in new highs and then we had you know we actually had a real All Season where do you know where Bitcoin dominance cratered from like 60% to 40% um but then there's other times like 2019 where Bitcoin didn't make an all-time high in in that bull run like I mean it was a bull run like 35 or 3100 to 14K but it didn't make a new high and then altcoins didn't really rally after Bitcoin after Bitcoin hit its high so I think a lot of times it it depends on if Bitcoin hits a new high or not um I remember that rally because chain link was the one thing that went up and I was so happy because I bought Shain Link in 2019 yeah and I mean I I mean there was there was one question uh I don't know where it was but I mean it's it's something to think about and I I I think it's easy to sort of think uh sort of forget about this stuff especially when when prices are trending um but where was that question basically the the question was sort of surrounding the the whole fed pivot and stuff and sort of an acknowledgement that um here it is with the FED data inflation going down and labor market still resilient do you think that the FED pivot will crash the markets as usual or is it a different environment and I mean like it I I think it's got to be something we at least think about right I mean because normally rate Cuts I think as Rob was saying earlier one of you I know it was Guy I think who said it I can't remember but one of you guys said normally rate Cuts imply they're doing it for a reason you know they're not just doing it because hey they want our alt coins to do well um that was good but I mean yeah I mean like you know if if I guess that's the question is like if there are rate Cuts this year what is that you know does that carry is that a macro is that a is that a narrative that no one a lot of people aren't talking about right now that everyone's gonna be talking about in five months um that could be it you know uh and I I think that is that's obviously on on my mind but um yeah I I think just something something to think about right there's always a risk uh and I I think it's silly to just not even consider the risk so I think uh did you guys have anything else I don't know if you guys saw any any any questions in the chat that I I missed um no I don't think so I think it's good to have a lot of different a lot of different views on here um I really like it when we disagree on stuff because if if we agreed on everything then we only need one person to do the show right that's right that's exactly right so I I do think it's a good thing when we when we disagree um I know I know Rob and Guy were sort of in disagreement on the Spy DTF stuff earlier and I think we'll have some resolution relatively soon I mean they're gonna either they're either gonna approve it or not I guess they could delay until until a few more months but um at some point at some point I think we just say if they if they don't do it in January at what point is Rob right you know yeah yeah this is gonna be very important to uh to establish at what point is Rob Vindicated and Simon Dixon has to wear the yeah exactly like it can't just be this like oh like this never ending they just keep reapplying for the next three years and then eventually it goes through yeah I I don't know I mean I think the market have the t-shirts been made that's that's an important thing is there are there ihart masinski t-shirts in existence I need proof of t-shirt P it's it has not been made but the plan has already been in place the shop has been found and the design has been created I will just say that okay yeah okay right that's good that's and there's there's there's a 48 hour turn around so I'm sure Simon is waiting for my call which I'd be happy I I got to say I'd be happy to make that call hey buddy you're right let's get this thing over with everybody can make fun of me it's good will you will you wear it on what what are the stipulations will you wear it on NFA I could it's it's it's actually a really good design I I would actually wear it on NFA but the people like why is Rob wearing an i well actually when they when they see it they'll understand why I I picked that so yeah I'll wear it damn I shouldn't have said that now everybody's gonna remind me on Twitter because every every every every story on Twitter that's about positive about the ETF I get tagged and there's always an emoji of a t-shirt I'm like H I know it's coming hey look Rob you'll be able to sell these t-shirts there'll be there'll be a sensation I think you should prepare for a large print run my man that's right good excellent excellent I'm gonna do that um yeah so we have one minute left I don't I don't I mean I guess someone noted that bitcoin's up is it really up three and a half percent in the last hour I'll take it well it it it it had that it had that little plunge yesterday didn't it I mean I I some of some of my colleagues sort of disagreed with me um calling it a dip um you know it's sort of like you think that's a dip wow you you been all these years but it was it was a noticeable you know I did a Jessica and I did a live stream yesterday and there was there was some slightly sort of ort of panicky people in the comments like WTF is going on you know is this it like next stock 30k etc etc and it was all because you know as I understood it it was because of um uh one of the M Matrix Port analyst uh came out and said I you know the SEC won't approve these spot ETFs in January and then the block picked the story up and and ran it and that was enough to you know to to to to make the price drop a little bit and then of course uh the old The Usual Suspects you

- Sticking to a long-term investment plan is crucial, as the 4-year crypto cycles have held up. Short-term trading is very difficult.
- Meme coins have a place in the crypto ecosystem and should not be faded.
- The crypto sector has shown remarkable resilience, bouncing back from the FTX collapse and thriving in a high interest rate environment.

- Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) gaining prominence as centralized exchanges face regulatory challenges.
- Increased focus on cold storage solutions to avoid custodial risks.

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin dubious speculation if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse tocom link is in the description below let's go ahead and jump in so in this video I just want to go through a lot of the different indicators and and levels that we've been looking at over the last several months provide an update on on where we are today and just take it from there as far as the spot ETF stuff goes I just want to remind people I have no idea you know the resolution of that whether it's going to be accepted or rejected I don't I have no idea and frankly I don't really care okay so we're just going to look at the charts and and stick with that and and hopefully it's it's useful to to you guys so the first thing is um we did get a a little bit of a drop this morning um it's funny because you know while we did get a drop the weekly candle as of this point is still green but this drop was about an 11% drop so I mean it is enough to get people's attention right it's enough to sort of get the blood flowing and and make you wonder like is it is it something more or is that it now what's fascinating to me is when we think about bitcoin price history one of the things that you may remember is that volatility is not something that Bitcoin shies away from and in fact back in like 2016 2017 Bitcoin had 30 40% Corrections right this was a a fairly normal thing for Bitcoin to get in 2019 when we had some of these Corrections we had you know 20% Corrections or so right that was a 133% correction um you know this correction right here this was about a 20% correction and then there was a larger correction of 72% but you might say well that was because of the pandemic but before the pandemic even was a thing there was still a 50% drop but what's interesting is so far there has not been a 25% correction in over a year right and I I it's kind of weird to believe I mean it certainly feels like there has been right I mean if you think back to everything we experienced in 2022 if someone told you that Bitcoin did not have a 25% correction during that time it would almost be hard to believe like it's like well how could that possibly be true that it did not have even a 25% correction and you know you can go take a look right I mean there's there's three main areas where the price of Bitcoin corrected in February you can see right here that Bitcoin had a 22 a half% drop or so we then had another drop right here in April April that lasted until June that was about a 20% drop and then we also had another drop right here that started in July and lasted until September that was about a 21 and a half% drop so Bitcoin essentially had three 20% drops in 2023 nothing more right nothing nothing really more no 25% drops and so because even in recent history we've seen Bitcoin has dropped 20% it's always relevant to think well where would a 20% drop even put Bitcoin from the most recent High just to keep that level in the back of your mind a 20% drop from this high would put Bitcoin right around 36k 36 37k if it were to go down to 22% which is what you know one or two of those last Corrections went to it would put it back down to about 35k so a pretty big drop now the thing that we've talked one of the things we've talked about many many times is the bull market support ban and the 8-week moving average okay these are two very important levels that we've discussed in the past that 8-week moving average and the bullmark sport band now the reason why we talk about the bull Mark sport ban is because often times Bitcoin will pull back to that level right you can see it had a pull back to that level right here in March it had a pull back to that level in June of 2023 we broke that level in August of 2023 but we also said we were likely going to break it back then because normally in Q3 of the prehab year we go below the bull market Spore ban that is nothing new we went into that with that expectation I was actually surprised that we did not take out this low right here right we actually came really really close to it within aund one1 or $200 we did not actually take it out so when we look at Price action today and just keeping in mind prior moves that we've seen nothing out of the ordinary from this Wick here down to the bullmark sport band to the 21 we EMA is about a 20% drop to the 20we estima is about a 25% drop right so that would still be in line with what we previously seen now there is the 8we moving average that is currently at just below $41,000 now the 8we moving average is important because we've sort of watched how in some of these prior uptrends that 8we moving average will hold support but once it breaks things can become testy right you know sometimes you get below the8 we and you hold support after the 20we SMA other times you get below it and and there's nothing you know there's there's there's not there's no real fight by the Bulls to hold the line so so far remember the 8we moving average is at around $41,000 it's just below $41,000 okay so if you start to see weekly closes below 41k that would imply that at the very least you could start to see a a pullback to that bull market support band so let me tell you what I let me show you what I mean so if you look back every time we've dropped below the 8 we we then went to the bull market support band or lower at least in in this in this move that we've seen here over the last year so right going below the 8we SMA right here eventually led to the bull market support band and then going below the 8we SMA right here eventually led to the bullmark sport band so that is the question is is do you get a weekly close below that level or not right so if you don't get a close below that level then nothing's really changed right I mean nothing's necessarily really changed at that point um there's been plenty of times where we you know we sort of went sideways into the 8we SMA maybe got a fake out but then still continued higher um you know there's examples over here as well but you can see that a lot of times when the 8we moving average is is lost it's normally just a simple matter of time before we test that 20we esate okay so that's the first area that I would say is important is that 8we moving average just below 41k weekly close below that likely means we're going back down at the very least to the bull market support band now in the short term who knows if this is even the local high it could be it certainly could be and there are reasons to believe that it could be uh there's also reasons to believe that it wouldn't be but I will say you know no matter what your bias is if you want it to be the high you'll find a reason for it to be the high if you don't want it to be the high then you'll find a reason for it not to be and I I'll show you a couple of examples okay so for instance if you wanted to go into this and and try to figure out a reason why it could be a a local high you could take something like a fib retracement tool now you might say well Ben I mean we've looked at this before we've looked at at it compared to both Peaks but if you look at the second Peak you can see that the the level has gone up it hasn't even reached the 618 right so the 618 would be at around 482k 48.5 okay this is where the 618 uh FIB retracement level would be which we clearly have not yet reached a Counterpoint is to say well what if the first Peak is where we should be measuring it from right so if you measure the Fib retracement from the first Peak down here you actually can see that it went to the 618 and then basically came all the way back down to the 0. five retracement right so a pretty clear local rejection at the very least right so that I think is is is one thing to look at another thing that's kind of interesting to me is we've talked a lot about you know the idea of of a midcycle top and the reason why we've talked about that is because when you look at at at interest rates and we just look at at at say like the prior cycle and and and again like if you're if you seen these if you've been watching my videos you already know what I'm going to say but the general idea as we've discussed many many many times is that there is a reasonable chance not something to take to the bank but there's a reasonable chance that Bitcoin puts in some type of midcycle top around the time that rate Cuts begin or maybe just before rate Cuts begin okay now the market currently thinks that the First Rate cut is not going to happen until March I don't know when it's going to happen it could be March that's probably you know that's probably the base case it could be may it could even be January depending on where the jobs data comes in this week right I mean like if the unemployment rate prints 4% then maybe they would even cut in in January but for now you know the base case Still Remains March if you think about where Bitcoin put in its midcycle top last cycle it occurred a few weeks before rate Cuts began right so local high then rate Cuts began and then we bottomed out after rate Cuts ended essentially or around that time so that's one reason sort of be on the lookout right on the lookout for something like that and you know it's so hard to know if if it's already occurred it's hard to know if there'll be some type of you know approval with with the spotf and then everyone will just rush in and and lead to then a final you know a final move before a larger pullback I don't know I I I really don't but I will say that you know sort of the thesis that I've talked about for a long time is some type of midcycle top just as rate Cuts arrive now that might seem counterintuitive rate Cuts would imply looser monetary policy which therefore should be good for risk assets right well a lot of times the reason it's not good for risk assets is because the fed's not normally willing to cut enough in order for to make a difference you think about it why would the FED cut if the economy is strong right if you think about it why would they cut it's probably because they think that the economy is not as strong as some of the data would maybe lead you to believe and so what they'll often do is they'll start cutting ahead of that now if they start to cut it's sort of an acknowledgement that that the economy is starting to show signs of weakness but the issue is if they're only going to cut 25 basis points or 50 basis points it's not like that's going to move the needle on the US economy you would probably need several hundred basis points for it to actually make a difference so that's often the reason why when you get rate cuts the market doesn't even find a local low because it's just simply not enough to move the needle so that is the question is is will you know is this playing out in a similar manner where we find some type of local high just before rate Cuts begin so I would keep an eye on that 8-week moving average and if we fall below it then the bull market support band is where you would look to If We Hold the 8we moving average and we get weekly closes above it for the next couple of week you know going into whatever the resolution is to the spot ETF then you could always make the case of of of you know of of bitcoin's price still staying strong for for a little bit longer before a larger pullback and you might say well does does Bitcoin have to have a larger pullback well one of the things we've mentioned is that you know often times you will see you know after a a a move higher you will get a cool off period and and you can see right here like if you take it from this low to this low it's about 15 weeks this low to this l low um was about 14 weeks and then that loow to this load right here was about 13 weeks so you got about 13 to 15 weeks between these prior lows and we're already at 16 weeks and there hasn't really been a drop at all I mean you know there was this drop right here so if you want to say that that was the drop then it occurred after 13 weeks but if that is all that you get then clearly the market is sort of deviating from the pattern that it was you know that it was previously you know sort of respecting about you know about what 3 months three to four months between these you know between these larger drops that always corresponded with interacting with the 20we ese Andor 20we EMA in some way okay and again the 20we ese is at 33,900 the 21e EM is at 35,800 so it's a pretty big spread there about a $2,000 range and and and you know it's still well below where we currently are so that's so relevant I I you know I think to think about is if we drop below the 8 we that is where I would in fact look now remember if you look at the FIB retracement tool from the first Peak it gets you right it gets you it shows you that we've already gone to the 618 if you take it from the second Peak right if you take it from this peak right here we haven't right and it would it would be all the way up at like 482k so you know a much a much higher level than the current prices if it were to make it to the 618 from the second Peak but you know it's it's impossible to know you know if if if one is more relevant than the other and it's also fair to say that those retracement levels might not play out at all anyways so I just want you to see that in terms of these prior moves if you look at like say the short-term bubble risk we talked about you know something similar happening where you know you get that first move up and then you get a larger move up but remember this this peak here on the extension from the 20we moving average did not correspond to the high you can see that a few weeks later we put in a slightly higher high before fading to that bull market support band right and so far the same thing has happened because you know this is a slightly higher high and you know the question now is is does it fade back down to the 20we SMA over the next few weeks so that's basically what happened over here right is is you got your first move up the extension from the 20 week was what like so if you if you take it from down here the extension was about 40% or so just like it was right here right about a 40% extension but in both cases while it extended 40% from the 20we SMA it did not mark the local high and in fact the local high occurred here four weeks later so we're now at four weeks later so are we here right are we right here is is the question is it is it is it emulating what occurred earlier in the year where you get your initial Spike up 40% above the 20we SMA you consolidate for a few weeks and then you get a larger pushup but the extension from the 20we is not as much as it was during the initial move and then it fades back down so that I I I think is is is what to look for and look if the spot ETF is rejected then of course that would be a great narrative sort of a company bitcoin price action back to the downside if it's approved then you could always take out you know you could always take out the local high but or maybe it's just to sell the news I don't know but that I think is is is sort of things to look at and say well look I mean this is what happened last year and and maybe it'll happen again um it's funny because again people a lot of times it's like it's hard to imagine uh for a lot of people it's hard to imagine the price going back down if it's only been going up for you know two to three months straight and then and then Bitcoin you know it can't eventually make that move um I also you know I also wanted to mention that you still have your logarithmic regression um uh so this this is the fair value logarithmic regression Bandit and what's interesting is you know it's it's basically getting hung up right here at that that fair value this is this thing was fitted back in like 2019 so forgive me for you know this right here I mean this was also below right here but it's interesting because this level is the same level that got rejected at right here so it's you know Bitcoin struggling to get to get above that right now um if you look at at the regression rainbow you can see that it's it's struggling to do the same thing right like you know to to get above this band right here that's sort of where it's still stuck between um which coincidentally corresponds to the two and a half log line rule from from this peak right here which is two and a half log lines below this peak which is two and a half log lines below this peak which is two and a half log lines below this peak so it's interesting how this is you know how this is playing out now I know what you're all thinking you're probably like well how does the Bitcoin dominance play in this well I'm glad you asked so you know the Bitcoin dominance is is you know it's currently at at 52.6% if you followed my stuff for a while you'll know that I've said before that what you'll likely see on larger pullbacks is Bitcoin dominance going up this is a great example right where Bitcoin is down but dominance is slightly up if you think back to 2022 there were many times where Bitcoin would drop and then Bitcoin dominance would go down now you're seeing periods where Bitcoin drops and Bitcoin dominance goes up and in fact if you look closely at this Wick by Bitcoin you'll see that it's it's actually you know it went slightly below this wig from December 18th um not as bad as the wick from December 11th but if you look at like ethereum look what's going on I mean this Wick takes you all the way back to November 7th so the Market's getting a little jittery right I mean there's no there's no denying it I mean this is and again we we'll get into this in a minute but Bitcoin is relatively stronger than the rest of the asset class okay relatively than the collective altcoin Market yes I'm sure there's some altcoins that are up today you know I'm sure there's plenty that that barely even blinked on this drop but we know that most of them saw a larger drop than Bitcoin because the Bitcoin dominance is up okay so the thing that that I I go back to and I I I go back to it time and time again especially as it relates to the dominance of Bitcoin is you know what's going to happen if you do get a larger pullback right what would happen to the altcoin market and I mean as you can see today the altcoin market is a lot more jittery than Bitcoin I mean again look at bitcoin's drop compared to this move over here and then look at ethereum yes I mean it it's recovered a lot of it but this is a big wick you know this is a big wick and and so was this one where Bitcoin dropped 11% today ethereum that was a 22% drop right so one of the things that I've mentioned before is that and again I I I get into a lot of trouble for saying this and and and it and it and it's a great dunking point for my critics but one of the things that we have seen in the past there's no guarantee that it happens this time but one thing that we've historically seen is a secondary scare I have no idea if it's going to happen um I we've I've seen it happen many many times and and when it has happened um basically no one thinks it's going to happen because we've only gone up for so long that everyone thinks that it's immune to ever going back down and so what ends up happening is Bitcoin gets some type of like 50% correction just when no one's expecting it right like just as everyone's saying buy the dip um then you get a larger correction and so I just I I don't know if it's going to play out like that or not I gave you know I I I I talked about it a lot that that sort of the window for it would be from Q3 of last year through about the first half of this year would sort of be that window if it's going to happen you would expect to see it happen um but we'll see I mean there's there's certainly no guarantee and you know to be intellectually honest with myself a a move back to 38k or 35k is not a is not a scare I mean this is just what we've seen right a move from 46k to 38k is 177% right you could go down 22% and still be at 35k hell even a move back to 31k would not be considered in my opinion sufficient to label it a secondary scare right it just wouldn't be the reason is because I mean like like look at look at 2016 Bitcoin had a a a pullback back to the spot that it finally broke from you know broke out from right here and maybe I should um right if you see that right So eventually you know it broke out here and then eventually it it retraced all the way back I don't look at that and say oh there's your secondary scare right you don't it's just not it's not a valid way to look at it in order for the secondary scare to be something that would be acknowledged you would have to take out a a a prior low in the structure of the market and I'm not saying it has to be this low but it it would need to be you know a significant low for it to really be a scare okay if that happens then it's playing out like it always has like it's playing out how it did in Prior Cycles if it doesn't happen then it's deviating from prior Cycles right because like you can see over here this drop I mean it it even if you exclude the pandemic it took out that low if you go back you know to to to this over here this low took out that one so that is something that has historically happened now one thing to consider with all of this is that you know if you go take a look at um let's go take a look here at um the social risk so the social risk is interesting because you know it sort of came back up to that. three risk level but it hasn't durably broken above that so I'm still of the opinion that we're kind of at this phase of the cycle right where social risk goes up as some people come back to the market but what if in the same way that it happened last cycle while you get up to that3 risk level it then sort of Fades back down as rate Cuts arrive so I I still think that that going to be my base case that we're just in the process of a of a midcycle top whether it's rdn or whether it comes within a week or two or or maybe in a little longer I don't know but I'm still of the opinion that that you know that's kind of where we are um and I will continue to sort of think that until until proven otherwise right and I I I'm open-minded I'd like to think I'm open-minded to being proven otherwise on that uh but you know it hasn't certainly it hasn't happened yet so with you know with Bitcoin the other things some of the other things that we've looked at um like if you go look at um sorry um yeah so if you go look at the running oneyear rli this is another interesting way to look look at at Bitcoin so I actually clicked on ethereum if you look at at at the the one-ear running Roi you can see that the current one-ear Roi is is actually at levels that we have had you know some pullbacks from and it's not just because bitcoin price has to go down but it's also because when you look at the reference point a year ago price was starting to go up so if the if the price does not go up commensurate with what was going on a year ago then the oneye ROI will likely start to come back down so my guess over the next few months you will see the one-year Roi come back down the only way that that doesn't happen is that Bitcoin goes up quickly enough to keep Pace with a price appreciation that Bitcoin had a year ago okay the other thing that you can look at are monthly returns and and and look at at it for let me switch this over to to to crypto but if you look at at monthly returns and and just look at say like a monthly count and you you add one when the monthly candle is green subtract one when it's red interestingly we're at a monthly count of 24 right which is where the monthly count was back in March of 2021 and you can see the monthly count topped out at 2020 or at 23 in in 2018 or sorry like late 2017 early 2018 so I I think that's an interesting way to look at the market too um by the way if if you're curious what this chart is it's sort of just looking at the ROI to low after inversion of three Monon 10e yield for the S&P 500 compared to the uh the iial crisis but I I don't really think that these these analogs never repeat right they you know they all look the same until a certain point and then they and then they deviate okay so I wouldn't you know I wouldn't put a ton of weight into this stuff but it is just something to sort of think about um so I'm trying to think if there's some other charts that that we should you know briefly talk about or if or if that's kind of um if this is the other one I think that you could you could take a look at and that's basically just comparing this cycle to the last couple of cycles and this is kind of where Bitcoin is compared to the last couple of Cycles so you can see that last cycle there was a pretty big drop cycle before that there wasn't and so a lot of that depends on you know if Bitcoin you know does it does it get that recession or you know does it get that secondary scare or does it not um and that's something we'll have to you know of course have to wait see so I I suppose what I'm you know what i' be looking for over the next few weeks are you know does the 8we moving average hold if it doesn't then there's a good chance we're going to the bullmark sport band okay so if the 8we if the 8we does not hold on the weekly time frame then we're likely going to the 20we SMA because that's what normally happens when the 8 week is broken you'd be hard pressed to find a time where the 8we doesn't you know break and then doesn't event eventually visit within a few percent of the bull market support band right like it doesn't always happen but a lot of times it does right like a lot of times it does happen um and I'm sure we can find exam and even you can see even over here it happened um like right here breaking down below down below there um here when it did it there was this one's an example of really where it wasn't but it came within a few percent so that I think is what you should watch right if we break below the 8we then the 20e SME is definitely in the cards and if history is any indication breaking the 8we SMA you know if we do go down to the bullmark sport ban that's about a 22% drop uh which is in line with what we saw uh with these drops over here now the question of course is if we do drop to the 20we SMA would it hold as support right that's the bigger question and I think I think the answer to that will ultimately depend on if the FED achieves a soft Landing or not if the FED achieves a soft Landing then you know there's hope but if not if if they've overtightened which is a real possibility based on the context of History then you could go below that and and then you you know you could potentially come make back in and retest this level and it just depends on on how far the FED win and you know how far the FED funds rate potentially is above the neutral rate right so it depends on a lot of things as to um you know as to whether Bitcoin would hold that ass support or not um and you know as as Bitcoin gets this move it'll be interesting to see how how Bitcoin pairs behave like how ether Bitcoin behaves uh during you know during a move like that because so far as we pointed out earlier during these Corrections by Bitcoin it seems like ethereum is getting somewhat jittery right I mean it's like Bitcoin sneezes and and eth goes down 20% it's kind of interesting when you think about it because one way to think about the market is to think about you know who makes up you know the market participants think about it like the social risk right like so go to the social risk you know when we were over here there were not these big Wicks right not not like not like daily wicks in the same in the same way like you weren't getting like 20 30% or 25% flushes in a single day that frequently right I mean it was mostly turning up but what happened like what what changed in December what well perhaps what changed is the social risk going back up so basically like retail coming back and and and and sort of yoloing in and then getting spooked the minute that it drops and then selling and then leading to a liquidation Cascade which is often where the secondary scare materializes from is you know people late to the party come in they buy the local high they get scared and then they Panic sell and if it ends up being a midcycle top then it could be a large correction just like in 2019 but we'll see you know those are my general thoughts on the market I I think you guys pretty much know where I stand on the market um I don't think it's you know it's not really that surprising I think my views um you I I think we're you know we're near a midcycle top is my guess I don't know if this is it or if it if it goes a little bit higher um but once that's in then I think we have to figure out all right how much damage did the FED do how you know will they be able to cut quickly enough to to sort of lead to a soft Landing or or not and and that's where you that's where I currently stand so if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up

key indicators. The presenter discusses several important levels and trends to monitor, including the bull market support band, the 8-week moving average around $41,000, and Fibonacci retracement levels.The presenter suggests that a weekly close below the 8-week moving average could lead to a pullback towards the bull market support band, which would represent a roughly 22% drop from current levels. This is based on historical precedent, as the 8-week moving average often acts as a key support level before Bitcoin visits the bull market support band.The presenter also draws parallels between the current market cycle and previous cycles, noting the potential for a mid-cycle top around the time of expected interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. He acknowledges the possibility of a secondary scare drop, similar to what was seen in previous cycles, which could be triggered by a liquidation cascade as retail investors get spooked and panic sell.Regarding altcoin performance, the presenter observes that altcoins have been more volatile than Bitcoin during the recent market downturn. This is attributed to the increased social risk in the market, as retail investors may be more prone to panic selling in response to Bitcoin's price movements.Overall, the presenter maintains a cautiously optimistic outlook, but is waiting for further confirmation before making a definitive call on the market's direction. The key levels to monitor are the 8-week moving average and the bull market support band, as a break below the 8-week could signal a deeper pullback towards the support band.",328,"[0.019226074,

Benjamin Cowen,Bitcoin: Bull Market Support Band,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeP-IB2PB8,"Video Transcript of youtube video 'Bitcoin: Bull Market Support Band' by 'Benjamin Cowen' released on 2023-12-28 00:00:00

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to provide an update to the bull market support band if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the Crypt premium at intothe cryptoverse decom it has been a little bit since we provided an update so I do just want to go through a few different things the bull market support band now ranges from 33k to around 35k K so a range of approximately $2,000 and still well below the current price action of Bitcoin in fact in order to get back to the 21 we EMA it would require at this time about a 177% drop and the 20we estimate would require about a 22% drop just to get back to those levels so one of the things we've spoken about this year though is the extension from the 20we moving average right right so like if you look at the short-term bubble risk which again is just the extension from the 20we SMA you can see that we've repeated a lot of the the price action in the early part of the Year where we saw a brief extension from the 20we SMA for a little bit before ultimately seeing extend before ultimately seeing it extend even higher right so there was sort of a buildup period over here where Bitcoin got above the 20we SMA and then in March it accelerated that move got a lot higher and the extension from the 20we SMA was even was basically the highest it's been for for most of the year right except for what we've seen just in the last month or so and now we're seeing something similar take place again where there's a little build up a little bit of a buildup and you get above that 20we moving average you kind of trend sideways for a while just like we did over here and then you see Bitcoin accelerate up again just like it did back over here and go to the extension from the 20we moving average which is more less the same spot that I went to in March of 2020 now again the interesting thing and as we pointed out even though the extension from the 20we SMA back in March was the furthest in midm March we also know that Bitcoin did go higher a few weeks later right it just wasn't as extended from the 20we SMA a few weeks later because of course the 20we SMA had time to catch up another way to view this is by looking at the natural log of the price over the 20we moving average and kind of seeing like it's it's kind of it's just moved up to the same level it was at back in in March 2023 we've also looked at this in terms of sort of diminished extension from the 20we moving average the idea that the extension from the 20we SMA from one cycle to another diminishes right you can see once upon a time it it was pretty far extended and as time has gone on the extension from that moving average the 20we moving average tends to diminish and it's actually one of the reasons why you know again back in in 2021 why I was actually quite bearish at the first Peak it wasn't because I thought the the market cycle high was in it was just because I said look in terms of the extension from the 20we moving average we're fairly extended at this point especially in given the context of history and if we are to assume diminished extension from the 20we moving average then it might be a safe assumption to assume that we would get a summer lull in 2021 which is what we got and while we did go to a higher price later on in 2021 the extension from the 20we ese was a lot less now what you'll notice is that in 2019 we got close to this trend line but we actually did not make it there and so the question of course now is is will it make it there or will it sort of fade before it reaches it like it did in 2019 sort of just put that trend line back on the screen one of the interesting things is if you go to where the extension was in 2019 and draw a horizontal line across you can see that it would actually go above um that downtrend line for us to reach that extension above the 20we ese that we reached in 2019 sort of showing just how explosive that move was in 2019 right and just how far above the 20we SMA that the price of Bitcoin got in fact from this from this level here you can see the Bitcoin price was 120% above this 20we moving average whereas a few weeks ago Bitcoin got about 48% above his 20we moving average so you can see that from one cycle to another the extension above of the bull market support band or at least a component of the 20we moving average tends to diminish okay and that sort of is in line with the idea of us seeing diminished volatility as a function of time I will remind you that we saw a similar rally going into rate Cuts in the last cycle as well and you know I I'm not here to say that it has to play out in any specific way it's just sort of an acknowledgment that this rally at least this initial rally before we had a cooldown phase this initial rally started to fade once rate Cuts arrived you can see that Bitcoin found a local high before rate Cuts actually came in and so the question is is well will it play out in a similar manner this cycle or not Market expectations right now are that rate Cuts come in March so if it were to play out in in a similar manner as it did in 2019 it would imply a a local top sometime before March I mean it could be in January it could be in February who knows right but it would imply that if it were to play out in the same way that it did last cycle where a a sort of an intermediate top comes in um and then and then it fades it into rate cuts and then sort of the next low is found by the last rate cut that's what happened last cycle we can of course see if that's what happens this cycle as well but I do think that uh you know Bitcoin has been trending higher for a while now and of course there's the the spot ETF that everyone's talking about and if it if it does rally into that uh which again there's no guarantees that it does but I mean Bitcoin has been consolidating right here and slowly trending higher um but if it does if it does rally into that in early January then it it certainly could be time for a cool off period um for a while until until we go back to you know to Q and to looser monetary policy but that'll be if just you know if it plays out in a similar manner as it did last cycle or not which is no guarantee and I will sort of remind people just of that 100 we moving average um historically sometime around this point in the cycle uh and and and actually it's occurred even later on in the cycle as well um we we sort of retested that 100 we moving average and it's not you know it's just something that we sort of acknowledge that that does seem to be something that comes in at a phase in the cycle and in 2016 we you know we didn't we did not have a hard Landing it was um I guess you could argue that it was a soft Landing we didn't even have a recession back then but we did have a recession scare where a lot of people thought there was going to be a recession um we didn't really have you know an inverted yil curve or anything like that but there were other parts of the world where their economies were slowing down and I think there was some arguments that it could happen in the United States and it didn't and and Bitcoin basically retested that 100 week s Ma and continue to move higher whereas last cycle we retested it got a bounce but then ultimately fell through so I do think that at some point probably within the first few months of 2024 we'll see some type of back test of that 100 we moving average and then the question of whether it holds or not will probably be dependent on whether the FED achieves a soft Landing or if it's a hard Landing like the last cycle so that is I think something to think about over the next few months uh just for reference extension from the 100 we moving average last cycle reached approximately 94% before fading back down to it you can see that so far Bitcoin has gone above about 57% or so above the 100 we moving average and in line with the idea of diminishing extension from these moving averages my expectation is that it it might not reach the same level that it reached last like before that that large draw down I mean just to give you an idea of how high it would have to go to in in a in a very short period of time for it to reach say 94% above the 100 we moving average it would have to go all the way up um you know to over 50k and I'm not saying that can't happen it it it certainly could happen the point is is um that's how high it went last cycle we have seen diminish volatility as a function of time but also do remember that the 100 we SMA is starting to curl up so you know it depends on where the price goes I mean if the price were to just Trend sideways for a few months then the 100 we ese would then slowly start to come back up and and sort of fall into to to higher prices so that's an important caveat to it is that the extension the reference point from the extension is is dynamic right it's changing and so we must we we should consider that when when sort of thinking about how high above the 100 we estimate that it can go um but that is is is and by the way I mean if it if it were to extend that far above the the one week I imagine it would it would correspond sort of back testing that trend line um that I know I know a lot of people have have sort of pointed out over the last um over the last few months but anyways we'll see you know we'll see what happens here as we get into the final trading you know the final days of the year early 2024 should be an interesting time um with this Narrative of course on the spat ETF that everyone's been talking about all year I think we'll finally have some type of resolution to that uh which will be nice to see and and and see how price that ction unfolds um between that event whether it's good or bad um and and the having which is is coming up in April but my expectation is that in line with prior Cycles I would expect some type of of move back to the 100 we moving average but again it it could still be a couple months away before something like that something like that were to happen especially given uh these narrative events and you know we've really seen this cycle a lot of price action has been driven by these narratives if you think back to the merge for ethereum ether Bitcoin was rallying up until the merge and then right at right at the merge ether Bitcoin topped and then it faded uh we've seen prior institutional products launched for Bitcoin and and just after it we saw the market fade so I and again we have the Bitcoin having coming up in in April so this does seem to be just sort of chasing one narrative um and you know just Chas from moving from one narrative to another narrative uh pretty frequently but I in my experience narratives can always be used to exp explain price action um but often times price sort of dictates The Narrative and not the other way around right like if price were to go up we could find a narrative to support it if price were to go down we could you know we could find a narrative to support that as well um so that is uh sort of my at least initial view on the market um I I do know I mean know one other thing I want to do at least point out is we are going to have that cross of the 50 we and the 200 week SME relatively soon um you can you can see that they crossed here to the downside back in February and now they should be Crossing to the upside within the next couple of weeks which is interesting because it seems like this is going to happen basically right around the time of that uh sort of event in the next few weeks regarding a a spot ETF sort of that that cross to the upside as opposed to a a cross to the Downs side but anyways we'll wrap it up there thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe get give the video a thumbs up check out the s on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse docomo we put out several premium videos each week we have a website with thousands of charts not only on cryptocurrency but also equities and and and macro and and other things as well Commodities so make sure you guys check that out I will see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2023-12-28 00:00:00,"The transcript provides a detailed technical analysis of the Bitcoin market, focusing on the bull market support band, the 20-week moving average, and the 100-week moving average. The analyst notes that the bull market support band has narrowed to a range of $33,000 to $35,000, well below the current Bitcoin price. The transcript discusses the concept of diminishing extension from the 20-week moving average, suggesting that the price may not reach the same level of extension above this moving average as it did in previous cycles. The analyst also mentions the potential impact of upcoming interest rate cuts and the anticipated Bitcoin spot ETF launch, which could lead to a cooldown period before the next phase of the market cycle. The transcript also touches on the potential retest of the 100-week moving average, which has historically been an important support level in previous cycles. Overall, the sentiment of the transcript is cautiously bullish, with the analyst acknowledging the potential for near-term volatility and consolidation before the next major move.The main message and conclusion of the transcript is that the Bitcoin market is currently in a consolidation phase, with the potential for a cooldown period before the next phase of the market cycle, which may involve a retest of the 100-week moving average.",250,"[0.031219482, 0.016983032, -0.032196045, -0.02067566, 0.020095825, -0.025665283, 0.028396606, -0.01739502, 0.041656494, 0.019073486, 0.01727295,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the stable coin Supply ratio oscillator if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptoverse decom here is the stable coin Supply ratio okay so this is what is known as the stable coin Supply ratio if you're not familiar with it is the equal to bitcoin's market cap divided by the stable coin market cap so it can be equivalently inter equivalently interpreted to be the ratio of Bitcoin Supply and stable coin Supply denoted in Bitcoin so basically it just tells you the buying power right it tells you the stablecoin buying power and estimate its potential move it's potential to move the price of Bitcoin now when you look at this within the Ballinger bands the Ballinger bands what you'll see is that there can be periods where it goes outside of the upper band just like in 2019 just like in 2021 and just like we've seen it a couple of times this year and where it is is currently what's interesting is if you if you look at it in terms of an oscillator between these bands this is what it looks like now historically what has happened right like so in 2019 you can see that we went to the same level in May of 2019 that we did in March 2023 and we also went to an even higher level in 2021 what's fascinating is that just a few weeks ago we went to a new high on the stable coin Supply ratio oscillator than we've seen it Go ever before and now it has faded since then right it has faded since then but it is still a relatively high level because if you look at this I mean it's called an oscillator because the idea is that it oscillates between a fairly well-defined range the upper part of the range being somewhere between three and four which is where it is right now or where it was it actually went above four for the first time but again somewhere in this range between 3 to 4 tends to Mark the highs for the stable coin Supply ratio oscillator and then somewhere below -2 tends to Mark the lows now if you overlay bitcoin's market cap on here what you'll see is that often times when it goes to that 3 to four level it doesn't actually Mark the high in Price Right sometimes often times the actual price High occurs while the stable coin Supply ratio oscillator is coming back down as you can see in 2019 and also as you can see in 2021 right like the actual High occurred at 42k for the ssrl but then the price of Bitcoin went much higher than 42k in this distribution phase so that's an interesting thing to look at and we talked about the same idea back over here earlier in the year so the first Peak we said okay it could easily go higher than that um then we actually got a spike even higher and then as it faded the price of Bitcoin just pushed a little bit higher up to around 31k and then it started to bleed and it went back down below zero and then we just got another Spike all the way up to higher than it's ever gone before so you know if there is a more substantial pull back within the you know coming months I mean assuming there will be a a pullback at some point could be interesting to see you know does it actually go back all the way down to the lows as an oscillator or does it keep rebounding around the zero line that should be something to pay attention to I I think on the next on the next major pullback in the market is is does it hold kind of where it held last time or does it actually go back all the way down to these prior lows and you can see that back in the in the summer low of 2021 you can see that it came all the way down to about -2. 7 which is close to where it was back in in March of 2020 very similar in December 2018 and also very similar in June of 2022 so while they don't often they don't always Mark the low right we did go lower in 2022 we did go lower here in 2021 before it rebounded it does Mark a generally good a good area to get into the market when it does go below -2 and anyways we're going to keep it short again if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse docomo thank you guys for tuning in I'll see you next time bye",Youtube video,2023-12-22 00:00:00,"The video discusses the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) oscillator, which is the ratio of Bitcoin's market cap to the stablecoin market cap. The presenter notes that the SSR has reached new highs recently, going above 4 for the first time, with the typical range being between 3-4 for the upper band and below -2 for the lower band. The presenter explains that historically, when the SSR reaches the upper band, it does not always coincide with the actual price high of Bitcoin, as the price can continue rising even as the SSR oscillator is coming back down. The presenter suggests that on the next major market pullback, it will be interesting to see if the SSR holds around the zero line or if it goes back down to the prior lows around -2.7.Overall, the sentiment of the video is cautiously bullish, as the presenter is analyzing the technical indicators but refrains from making any definitive price predictions. The main message is that the SSR oscillator can provide insights into the buying power of stablecoins and their potential impact on Bitcoin's price movements.",217,"[0.036499023, -0.0058403015,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be putting back on an onchain analysis hat and discussing transaction fees if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe cryptoverse decom if you're not familiar with transaction fees in this chart we're just looking at the USD value of all fees paid to minor transaction validators stakers and or block producers that day and this chart you know it it used to be more useful than it is today but it does still I think provide value one of the interesting things is that historically whenever transaction fees spike it has been representative of a significant high right you can see that that happened back in 2017 it happened over here in April of 2021 both of of which ended up being significant highs now in 2021 we ended up going and putting in a higher high later that year about 6 months later or so now what's interesting is we saw a spike back in May and I remember making a video on it back then and what I also remember is I remember saying look guys transaction fees have spiked and everyone just saying well it's because of ordinals and I'm not saying that's not true I mean it is true right I mean it's not you know the the Mania that we had in in in April or May of 2023 was nowhere near what it was in 2021 and and 2017 but one of the things we said back then was that it could at least be a leading into a cool off period where this could be a local top and what's interesting is is it actually occurred if you look at the nature of transaction fees right like if you look at at this one in 2017 it spiked after the top was in and then if you look at 2021 right the spike occurred after the high was in and then if you look at March or May the spike occurred after the highway in and then if you go look at it today there was a spike coming just after this potential high now it's hard to know if this is you know the high for a while or not I mean you know there's all sorts of reasons to believe it could be or it could not be but the point is if you only looked at this chart in a vacuum and you had no clue about you know maybe the reason why transaction fees are spiking you know paint you know sort of just pointing toward ordinals um if you had no reason no narrative to go along with it if you only showed me this chart right it shows that often times there is a cool off period now a lot of people would point out that while it did cool off here in May of 2023 we were back to putting in new yearly highs by July right I mean so so what right but it at least did signal that there needed to be a cool off period now again there's the having in April and there's the whole spot ETF stuff that could be coming finally to fruition at least a decision within the next few weeks so it's hard to know if we're going to get a move into that or not or if the market will just front run it completely and everyone's waiting for something that's not actually going to happen um in terms of price movements associated with posi news but the point is that you know we are looking at transaction fees spiking and the only way that this I mean it could be a false signal the other thing is that it you know perhaps the high on transaction fees isn't in right and then and then it theoretically could go higher I mean it's already gone a lot higher than it went in 2021 so who's to say it couldn't continue to go higher from here and and you know just continue this trend um so that sort of caveat too but I did just want to bring this chart to your attention there's certainly a lot of a lot of charts out there that you can look at to sort of paint a more bullish picture and a lot of people have done that but I do want to you know talk about all the different charts and and at least this one is saying hey you know there could there might need to be a cool off period here sometime in the next few weeks and if if Bitcoin does push higher into the end of the year it doesn't necessarily negate this it could just mean that it's you know being delayed by you know another two to three weeks but it is historically transaction fees spiking like this are a signal that at least a few you know within a couple of months it normally comes back down to earth right not always immediately and even again and even in 2021 6 months later there was another high but historically after you know a a couple of months after these Peaks the market has has at least experienced some type of significant cool off period during that window and and you know there's a a period coming up up I think relatively soon early early mid January about mid January is often a a sort of a a unfavorable time for risk Assets in election years um so do keep that in mind so there are some signals that the market is getting overheated um and and we'll see you know we'll see if it if if if there's a push Higher by Bitcoin or not going into the end of the year the S&P continues to go up I did just want to put this video out and say look this has this has been a good warning sign before um and there have been times where the market did go just a little bit higher even after it topped but in all cases there was at least a even if a a very brief one there was always a cool off period sometime after the spike in transaction fees if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothe crypto.com links in the description below thank you guys for tuning in I'll see you next time bye and",Youtube video,2023-12-20 00:00:00,"The video discusses the recent spike in Bitcoin transaction fees, which the creator believes could signal a potential cooling-off period for the cryptocurrency market. The creator analyzes historical patterns of transaction fee spikes, noting that they have often occurred around market tops in 2017, 2021, and most recently in May 2023. While acknowledging the potential impact of factors like the upcoming Bitcoin halving and spot ETF decisions, the creator suggests that the current spike in transaction fees could indicate a need for a market correction in the near future, potentially around mid-January, which is often an unfavorable time for risk assets in election years. The overall sentiment of the video is cautiously bearish, with the creator highlighting potential warning signs that the market may be overheated and due for a pullback.Summary: The video suggests that the recent spike in Bitcoin transaction fees could signal a potential market correction in the near future, based on historical patterns of fee spikes coinciding with market tops.",193,"[0.015197754, 0.00774765, -0.031585693, -0.009010315, -0.0012102127, -0.028900146, 0.011749268, -0.014404297, 0.033935547, 0.03213501, -0.036346436, 0.02746582, 0.06707764, -0.010070801,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to provide an update on the bull market support band if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the Crypt ver premium at into the cryptoverse tocom link is in the description below make sure you check that out we have the website thousands of different charts for different cryptocurrencies I know I mostly just talk about Bitcoin and and ethereum and a few of the altcoins we have we have charts for all sorts of altcoins on that on on the website in this video we're going to go through you know where we stand with the 20we SMA do note that I believe after eight green weeks not that it really matters but we do have a red week um so we did get a pullback and we talked about that I I believe a week or two ago that often times after after getting a a string of seven or eight green weeks you know you will see you will see at least a pullback whether it it turns into something more than that we'll have to see but right now the 20we ese is currently around 32,400 the 21 MIM is around 34,300 so pretty wide range about about a $2,000 range there in terms of of the spread on the 20we estim and the 21 we EMA but what I like to look at is the extension from it so we did get a pullback so if you were to go look at say the the short-term bubble risk on this which is the extension from the 20we moving average we talked about this previously you know we first got that move up to the same extension that we got back in January and in February that's where the extension went to in November and then the extension above the 21 we that we just saw reached the same level that it was in March right so we pointed this out last week and we said look this is the same extension from the 20we ese that we reached back in March and we could be due for a pullback and this past week we at least did see Bitcoin pull back about five to six per. now I will say again I mean even if you pull up the the short if we pull up the short-term bubble risk even though the extension from the 20we topped out on the week of March 13th do note that while we did get a red week following that and then a couple of green weeks that went nowhere we did finally get one last pop up before fading back down to the to the bull market support band right so we had a strong move up red week do nothing for a couple of weeks and then another 7% move to the upside Now is it going to repeat in the same way probably not I mean this was a an 8 week stretch of green this was just a single massive green candle um you know this candle here was about a 28% move none of these candles over here were a 28% move but you know all in all it was a much larger move than that if you were to take it from where it began ended up being about a 64% move but the point is that over here it sort of just calmed down for about three weeks we got one final pump trying to think about what that would look like this time I mean if it were to play out in the same way probably won't right it probably won't play out the same way but if it did it would essentially mean I guess the next couple of weeks flat and then the first week of January getting one more pop which could correspond to the uh to the whole spot ETF stuff but and a 7% move higher from the current levels would would basically put you back at at where we were previously um back at at around 44k but it is it is an interesting chart to watch because we've we've seen sort of this extension from the 20we moving average hit these key levels a couple of times here right and you you could actually extend this back all the way to 2021 and see that it almost lines up there as well right so like the extension in late 2021 that first pump got close that same levels that we've been seeing over here and then that second pump above the 20we estimate that came in October which also preceded the final high right it came in October and then the final high was in November this one came in in March and then we had the final local top before going into sort of a summer low where we didn't go anywhere same type of thing um so interesting pattern to look at to especially to see if it if it ends up playing out uh once again but I mean you can see that the last time we reached you know broader extension from the 20we moving average where we were like 100% above the 20we SMA you'd have to go all the way back to late 2020 or early 2021 so it has been quite a long time since that happened and another way to visualize this is to is to look at the um the price over the natural log of the price over the 20we moving average and and if you look at it like that what you'll see is is you know sort of a a nice trend line here that we talked about back in 2021 as marking a a local top simply because that was kind of the the trend line that we have that we had hit so many times in the prior bull markets and going into the summer 2021 we had a video saying all right likely going to have a summer low we got to cool off from this thing now some you us would can we reach that same level here anything's possible but do notes in the prehab year of 201 19 we were unable to reach it right it took another it took another you know a year and a half or so before we reached that full extension um and so in order to reach it you know Bitcoin would have to Rally up a significant amount to get back above that level and I mean you can even see that the extension from the 20we SMA measured this way the natural log of the progess for the 20we SMA I mean you can see that it it essentially topped out the the extension from that 20we moving average basically topped out the same spot it did back in in March so interesting how how you know while the prices are different the levels the extension from the 20we have remained fairly constant in in all of these moves so far so something to to continue to to sort of think about in terms of other things that we could look at we could always take a look back at the regression rainbow and kind of see where we are I we basically just spent the the entire year if not more in the same regression band um note that the top of the regression B right now sits at around 475 47.5k the bottom of this regression band sits at around 27k right 27.3k so those are levels to look at and I mean you know it's also important to think about 27k and and 47 1 12K they're also important Confluence level Confluence in in other aspects as well for instance the 100 we SME is right around 27 28k right it's that's where it is and you know maybe maybe that's not relevant to you but it is notable that in you know at least the last in the first part of the having year last cycle we pulled back to the 100 we moving average right just like we did in 2016 as well and just like we did over here at the very end of the prehab year and sort of we took off from it in the early part of the having year right but in all cases we sort of re we Revisited that 100 we moving average late H late preh having year or early having year I'm not suggesting that it has to happen but if it does happen none no one should be surprised right it I'm not trying to say that anything has to happen right we have to be clear about that seasonality never has to happen you know we've covered seasonality on the channel a number of times and it seems to work out about 70% of the time the other 30% of the time we talk about seasonality doesn't play out and then and then people are be like well but you said look seasonality it does not always happen it just it tends to happen and so because it does tend to happen it's important to to consider that it's the same thing when you think about the 20we SME like the bull marks work B every single Q3 of every prehab year we've Fallen below it right we fell below it here we fell below it right here this was Q3 of the preh having year Q3 the preh having year over here we fell below it and then again this past year Q3 the prehab year we fell below it and so and a lot of people over here did not think we would right so you have to remember I mean it doesn't always play out but often times it does and so there's that Confluence at around that 27 28k level which also happens to correspond Loosely with that prior with these prior highs it would be just below those prior highs you know so think about 31k imagine if we went below that you went to 27 28k um that would correspond to the lower part of the regression band and then the upper part of this regression band which is run 47k happens coincidentally enough to correspond to the 618 right if you take the uh the FIB retracement tool here and you go all the way up to the 618 that's exactly where that turns out to be is right there at that regression band then you might say what's so special about the 618 well the reason it's relevant at least loosely is because if you take the extension you know if you look at the fiber trement tool over here you can see that that's exactly where Bitcoin rallied to was in fact the 618 and we also have to think about why did Bitcoin top out at the 618 over here and does it have to top out at the 618 here no no guarantee we make it there and no guarantee that if we do make it there it stops there but the reason why it's interesting to think about is if you look at interest rates Bitcoin topped out just before the FED started to cut rates right and it's almost like could that happen again right I mean you can see that it went to the top of this regression band just before the FED started to cut so we you know is it are we going to see something similar play out where it goes to the top of that regression band just before the FED starts to cut or maybe the FED start or maybe maybe it doesn't make it there but if it does make it up there to that 47 48k level and again you know we were I was talking about this um uh talking about this the other day on the on the no shill Zone with with Gareth and you know he's saying like a lot of people are calling for it maybe it won't actually happen I don't know right I I really don't know if we'll if we'll make it that high or not as I previously said my expectations have already been exceeded this year because I I I was sort of thinking you know 35k would would sort of Mark the limits for Bitcoin this year um but we we've exceeded that and I've learned in the past when it exceeds your limits like you know it's kind of foolish to just move the goal post just kind of get out of the way and and Let It Go however high it's going to go but just looking for you know for for areas that have been you know resistance levels in the past and and various Confluence um and and that's what we look for right so the upper part of the regression band happens to correspond to the 618 and um and so if we do make it there it would be important to think about where are we in terms of rate cuts are we starting to see those rate Cuts come in just like we did you know about four years ago and if we don't make it there or if we pull back down do we go back to the 100 week moving average which is exactly where we pulled back to right here in late December of the preh having year early part of the having year that's where we pulled back to now over there we ended up getting a recession we got a hard landing and we went a full regression band below that right so if we were to go a full regression band below this it would mean going all the way down here right if you if you draw a line right here across the page that's where it would corespond to basically the prior lows so it all really depends on on if we get a hard Landing or not and that depends on if the FED starts to cut sooner rather than later because again you know a lot of people are celebrating a soft landing and saying that you know the fed's accomplished everything they needed too and and inflation is where it needs to it's heading where it needs to be but this is the riskiest time like we're entering into the riskiest time where we could see the unversioned the yield curve as the FED starts to cut but you have to wonder why is the Fed cutting maybe they're cutting to get ahead of all the lag effects from all the rate hikes that we just had for the last two years so that should be the narrative that will likely be the narrative in 2024 are people worrying about rate Cuts as potentially the economy starts to finally slow down after after two years of tighter monetary policy and if they achieve you know if they if they achieve a soft Landing then you could see something like this where we essentially hold the 100 we moving average as support like in 2016 or if they've gone too far you could get a hard Landing where you go back to the 100 we moving average and everyone hopes that it holds that support and then just kidding hard Landing arrives recession rise the unemployment rate goes north to 4% the S roll triggers and all that other good stuff and then you get a hard Landing down to the lower regression band right and then you get sort of your your your retest just like you got over here so it really I mean it really all comes down to a lot of it comes down to to that and and how quickly are is the Fed able to get things under control so I mean I for for me right now I think the bigger risk is is rapid disinflation over the re acceleration of inflation at this point and I think that should be abundantly clear in the nature of the bond market recently the bond market continues to show strength despite the despite the advertised pivot by the Federal Reserve suggesting that the bond market is is more concerned about disinflation and the economy slowing down than it is about inflation re accelerating at least in the short term that doesn't mean that inflation can't re accelerate you know a year from now or or later on but I think in the short term the market is rightfully considered uh or more worried about about disinflation leading to potential deflation and it's already we've already seen some deflation in some categories uh than it is anything else but anyways that's what I wanted most to talk about this week where we are um and and do note I mean I was looking at at transaction fees and and normally you know these spikes as they as we get into these spikes that become sort of a a danger zone um so I'm not suggesting that you know that that it can't go higher it's just that a lot of times these spikes tend to

Bitcoin market, focusing on the 20-week simple moving average (20WMA) and its relationship to Bitcoin's price action. The speaker notes that after 8 consecutive green weeks, Bitcoin experienced a pullback, which is common after such a strong run-up. He analyzes the extension of Bitcoin's price above the 20WMA, comparing it to previous instances where it reached similar levels, and suggests that this could lead to a period of consolidation before another potential move higher. The speaker also discusses the regression rainbow indicator and how Bitcoin's price has been trading within a specific regression band throughout the year. He highlights key support and resistance levels around $27,000 and $47,000, respectively, and their significance in terms of historical price action and potential Fed policy changes. The overall sentiment of the transcript is cautiously bullish, as the speaker acknowledges that Bitcoin's performance has exceeded his initial expectations for the year. However, he emphasizes the importance of considering historical patterns and potential macroeconomic factors, such as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions, in assessing the future direction of the market.One-line summary: The video provides a detailed technical analysis of the Bitcoin market, highlighting key support and resistance levels, historical price patterns, and the potential impact of macroeconomic factors on the cryptocurrency's future performance.",271,"[0.00680542, -0.005558014, -0.010070801, 0.014083862, -0.01210022, -0.026672363, 0.040100098, -0.027633667,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be looking at the running Roi or return on investment if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the Crypt premium at intothe crypto.com where of course you can get access to the chart that you see here um as well as the same chart for many different assets cryp currencies and more but what we're going to do in this video is we're just going to look at the running oneyear Roi uh maybe look at a couple of other other examples on longer time frames and just sort of see the pattern that Bitcoin has previously exhibited now if you guys remember back to Q3 of 2022 back in about you know July August time frame we sort of speculated that there would be another drop going into Q4 right and one of the reasons is because actually quite frequently what you'll see is you'll see the running onee Roi bottom out at around point2 right I mean give or take right give or take and I mean again you can see that it it it it it did once again now what's interesting is after it goes to that level there does tend to be a a significant runup in terms of the the the running one-year Roi um and what's really interesting is if you look to see we are right now it's it's actually 2.53 X above where it was a year ago so not the bottom per se although it was pretty close to the bottom in terms of uh where the bottom was because the bottom came in in in um this low right here was November 20 21st December I mean it wasn't that much higher right so from that level Bitcoin has gone up you know from December Bitcoin has gone up about 2.5x and if you look at at prior moves with Bitcoin you can kind of see that at least in the last couple of Cycles right there there's been a significant move that that kind of loses a little bit of steam at around 3x in terms of the running one-year Roi right so you can see like in June of 2016 after the one-year running Roi was about 3x Bitcoin sort of stall out for you know a couple of months and then it actually dropped down for a little bit before finally resuming but I mean I know it doesn't look like much but after it had this move in June of 2016 Bitcoin did not durably move higher until essentially half a year later right so there was there was certainly a cooling off period after it got about 3x you know 3x up from where it was a year before and in the last cycle we actually saw something very similar where it it moved up and it reached about 3x a little bit less I suppose maybe about 2.89 and then it and then the one year running Roi cooled off and I mean again this was the um the pandemic drop but again you you can kind of see that it it reached a level from which it had to cool off from for for a period of time and you know Bitcoin then durably went above it about you know 10 months later or so right so about 10 months later here about half a year later over here now again right now it's at 2 .5x or so up now unfortunately you know the sort of the the the easy way for this to move up is sort of come and gone right because now instead of comparing this to prices that were going down we're going to start comparing it to prices that were moving higher and that's one of the reasons why the run the one year running Roi will sort of cool back off is because you know it has to keep up that pace if not more to you know to to hold up that level and if it just stays sideways then the running one your Roi will then start to go back down because it's comparing it to a a a different reference point but we can actually project out you know what it would take and by when to get it up to around 3x um let see a future projection and it's it's really hard to know like where to project it to uh you know Bitcoin has already made it to you know to um to 44k or 44.5k I have no idea to be completely honest exactly how high it's going to go before it gets a significant you know more a larger pullback I mean we we had about eight green weeks in a row seven or eight green weeks in a row this is a red week here but it still isn't really that much of a significant pullback in the grand scheme of things and if you look at things like the RSI which probably you know they're not really the best things to look at in terms of buying and selling but you know it is relatively elevated right it's you know it's above um above 7 75 it's currently at 76 or so so in terms of trying to figure out you know exactly how high it will go it's certainly until until there's a larger pullback is certainly anyone's guess but if we were to just speculate what would it take to get you know to get to about 3x up from where it was a year ago and and by win so I I guess the first thing to think about would be potentially the whole spot ETF narrative um that could come to fruition in early 202 for I I I don't know exactly when but um I think some people are speculating early January so let's just say I don't know January 7th um you know where would the price of Bitcoin have to be to sort of match somewhere between 2.9 to 3.1x uh from where it was a year ago and so we could experiment right so why don't we why don't we first start with 46k and see where that puts it so 46k would put it at about 2.7x from where it was the year before if it were at 48k that would put it out at 2.8 2.8x so that 2.81 you can see this one over here was about 2.89 before it finally started to cool off so I guess I mean I guess you're looking you know for it to reach that level it' have to go a little bit above that I don't know exactly how much above that but we can sort of play around with it and see so 485 we put it at 2.84 and and again to remember it also depends on when because if I were to change the date of this to a let's say a an earlier date it would actually make it you know easier for it to get up to that level right so now if it happens by you know January 1st then it's up 2.9x which is essentially where it was here before it kind of cooled off and also where it was here before it finally cooled off so that's something that's that's interesting sort of think about what would it take to sort of reach those levels of extension that it saw in in Prior Cycles um now the next thing to look at is is what would it you know where would it have to go to you know to come back down um and again there's no guarantees I I have mentioned before the idea of of sort of a scare that comes later on that tends to be macro related will it play out or not right I mean it's it's anyone's guess I suppose but it is something it's always a risk I think is is worthwhile to consider so you know what would it take for it to come back down to you know to these levels right you know back down to an Roi of one well if you think about it for it to go back down to a oneyear Roi of one it would have to go back to where the price was you know a year previously but at that point so like if it were to go back to like if it were to go back to to say 25k next June then that would get you back to one right if it were to go back to 20K by March again that would get you back to an Roi of one right so you can project that out by essentially saying all right well you know let's say by March I don't know 14th if there were a scare in the market um you know whether it's say like a a deflationary scare maybe maybe nonfarm payroll print a negative print or something who knows right what it could be or if it'll even happen but if it were to I mean you can see that that would actually get it back below one which is essentially what happened last cycle right it actually went below one so just something to consider I also think it's it's it's worthwhile to look at other time frames as well and by the way I mean I'm sure you know for the for for many of you you're probably sort of eyeballing this and thinking like oh well you can draw sort of an imaginary line through these Peaks and that's true I mean you you can and we've done that many times before and in fact there's a video on the channel we were looking at this in in um in March of 2021 I believe and and this was one of the charts that made me make that video calling for a summer low back in 2021 right the idea that we would basically re reached maximum extension and um and we need to cool off for a bit before going higher and we did um and you can kind of see we we sort of emulated what was going on over here but that second Peak wasn't nearly as impressive as as you know as it was back over here in the 2013 cycle so that that level depends on you know when it were to occur if it were to occur next year it it certainly wouldn't have to go as high to sort of hit that upper threshold but if it were to occur in 2025 then it would right it would have to go it would have to go higher because because then you're going to be comparing to 2024 prices um which for the most part are likely going to be higher than than where it was for most of 2022 it doesn't mean that you can't have have scares down there but you know for the most part so that would be something to consider as well um it could be useful also to to look at maybe like a 2-year Roi so this is the the 2-year Roi of of Bitcoin and it really has had you know a very similar pattern through Through The Years um you can see last cycle it it sort of came above one and then and then it came back down and then ultimately finally durably broke through that that one threshold you know by about May of the having year and over here it durably broke through that one threshold by about August of the having year meaning the 2-year Roi was above one durably by about halfway through the having year and so now you you can see that it's still not above that level right it's still not above it and and it actually got rejected off of that level back in July of 2023 it's kind of interesting right like that's essentially where it got rejected where the 2-year Roi was basically one and if you think about it right if you go from April of 2023 to April of 2021 right that was essentially you know that was essentially where Bitcoin you know started to to have that that big pullback right so you went up in April June June and July that was sort of comparing to to this pullback right here to 30k and that was ultimately where it topped out locally two years later now while the price of Bitcoin is higher than it was back in in the summer the 2-year Roi has not reached that same extension up to an Roi of one and so you know for it to to get back up there you'd have to think about where it would have to go so if we just sort of think about this where was Bitcoin 2 years ago today right well December of 2021 Bitcoin was already starting to come back down right so like it was basically back at like 50k so what that means is if Bitcoin were to go to let's say 50K by the end of the year that would basic and actually that would actually get you a little bit above one so imagine it really depends on when it happens because you know if you change this to a little earlier right let's change it let's say like the 24th then it it it essentially gets you back to that one level so that it's an interesting thing to look at because in both prior Cycles it did not durably break above one until halfway through the having year which is essentially another half a year away um so that would be worthwhile to consider especially considering the reference point will start to come back down right if you think about where it was two years ago and you can also look at this on on shorter time frames as well like this is like the 90-day Roi um which could be interesting to look at I mean you can see that the 90-day Roi doesn't often go above two and when it does it's not doesn't tend to last for too long I mean it can last for you know maybe a few months but it doesn't send to stay around that level for for for too long but yes at this point Bitcoin is is up almost 2x from where it was only 90 days ago the last time that we reached this level of of almost 2x up in 90 days last time was in in October 2021 and then the time before that was back in you know the early part of 2021 you can also see that we reached a 90day Roi of almost two back in June of 2020 and in 2019 of course we went much higher and then you can also look at at 30-day Roi as well if you want but I don't think that's as useful there's also the threeyear ROI and then here is let me just remove the future projection um and then here is the 4-year Roi right so then going back to the 2-year Ro and then the 90-day and so on and so forth right I guess it's not actually excuse me I misspoke earlier it's not at the 90day ROI is not at at at 2 yet it's at at about 1.6 that was including the projection out right so like it could go to that level if over the next couple of weeks Bitcoin were to go up but right now it's only at at at 1.59 X um and over the last 30 days it's up about 1.1 64x so just to clarify clarify what I said so we'll see what happens I I I do think that looking at the running one your Roi is interesting um and and can give insight into the market that maybe maybe weren't otherwise aware of again if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium at intothe  crypt.of Trends going on with apple and kind of interesting that you know where the one-year running Roi bottomed out in late 2022 early 2023 is is you know essentially where the one- year running Roi bottomed out in May of 2016 and around that level in April 2013 so you'll find some interesting Trends with a lot of different assets by looking at at the the running return on investment if you guys like the content again make sure you subscribe the S is going on into the Crypt premium link for that is in the destion below I will see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2023-12-15 00:00:00,"The video provides a detailed technical analysis of Bitcoin's one-year return on investment (ROI) and discusses potential future price movements. The presenter notes that Bitcoin's one-year ROI has historically bottomed out around 0.2-0.3, before experiencing a significant rally, reaching around 3x the previous year's price. The current one-year ROI is at 2.53x, and the presenter speculates that it could reach 2.9-3.1x, potentially by early 2024 if a Bitcoin spot ETF is approved. However, the presenter also cautions that after reaching these elevated levels, Bitcoin has historically experienced a cooling-off period before resuming its upward trend. The analysis also examines Bitcoin's two-year and 90-day ROIs, suggesting that the two-year ROI has not yet durably broken above 1, which has historically occurred around the halfway point of the halving cycle. Overall, the sentiment is cautiously bullish, with the presenter highlighting the potential for further upside in Bitcoin's price, but also noting the risks of a potential pullback or cooling-off period.",223,"[0.0069007874, -0.014877319, -0.004627228, 0.0019683838, -0.032714844, -0.0070724487, 0.026473999, -0.019378662, 0.006465912, -0.0052108765, -0.02909851, 0.005607605, -0.02178955,

Hi, today we're going to talk about Bitcoin but more specifically we're going to discuss the Bitcoin dominance if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the cryptographers premium uh into the cryptiverse.com let's go ahead and jump in now as you guys know I'm a big proponent of this of the Bitcoin dominance going up during this stage of the cycle about a year and a half ago I said I'm just going to Simply put on my Bitcoin Maxi hat and just wait this process out because I've recognized it in the past and I've seen what can happen throughout the bear Market year and the pre-halving year and just sort of recognizing the idea that the dominant should go up a lot to the detriment of the altcoin market of course on both their USD Pairs and their Bitcoin pairs I have maintained for quite some time that the Bitcoin dominance is the key to unlocking the secrets of the cryptographers there are of course a lot of people out there that will say things like the Bitcoin dominance is is not a worthwhile metric to follow but I also would say a lot of those people that discount its importance would have also likely been telling you to buy all coins for the last 18 months right now just simply looking at the dominance could have told you long ago that the altcoin market generally speaking was not worth the risk when compared to Bitcoin now I do need to note a couple of things here first of all there are always all coins that outperform some there's always a few right so any given cycle you could go back and say well what about this all coin or that altcoin or you could look at new altcoins being being you know pushed out and oftentimes you'll find that you know some of these really low market cap coins can go up in the short term and maybe outperform Bitcoin but when we talk about the dominance we're talking about the collective altcoin market so more or less total three this one so the idea is for every dollar you put into the cryptoverse you want to ideally make sure that you are maximizing your risk-adjusted returns or your sharp ratio that is the idea and if you're putting a dollar into the collective altcoin market and the collective altcoin Market is going down against Bitcoin then essentially what you're doing is you're taking on more risk for Less reward right that's essentially what you're doing because it's not to say that all coins can't go up if Bitcoin goes up it's to say that if if all coins do go up it's likely because Bitcoin went up a lot more and if Bitcoin goes down then the altcoin market gets crushed if you remember from you know the last Bitcoin dominance video we did we said one of two things we said all right guys we there's two scenarios right that are worthwhile to consider with with Bitcoin USD and how it relates to the Bitcoin Domino's only two scenarios right we either Hold the Line or we don't and in both cases the dominant should go up right if Bitcoin holds the line then we saw what happened over here in March right so if you overlay Bitcoin dominance onto this chart you can see that in March the dominant shot up win Bitcoin held the line at the bull market support ban so he said look If We Hold the Line again the dominance is just going to go up again more than likely I mean there's no guarantee but it seems like the most likely outcome is for the Bitcoin dominance to go up if Bitcoin USD holds the line for the second time in a row furthermore we said that if we get weekly closes below the 20 week estimate that the Bitcoin dominance should also go up it's interesting because we got a bit of both you can see if you zoom in here we actually had a weekly close below the 20-week SMA however we stayed above the 21 week EMA again it's a bull market support banned it consists of two moving averages and as long as they're holding between them right you don't have to hold you know both of them necessarily simultaneously there's plenty of periods where you might hold one and and and not the other right so as long as you're holding it we can go up or the dominance can go up but the weekly close below the 20 week SMA if you are watching closely you will note that there was a fundamental shift in how the altcoin market was behaving on that Weekly close below the 20 week SMA right so if you take a closer look at that if we for instance overlay the ethereum Bitcoin evaluation right which is what we're going to do and we'll we'll look at this week here you can see that ether Bitcoin started to plummet when Bitcoin had a weekly close below its 20 week estimate it started to plummet it's interesting and actually there's there's an even better way to look at this I think um and that's to look at the relationship of Bitcoin USD on a daily time frame with The Ether Bitcoin valuation and actually I think what I want what I really want to look at is is maybe um I'm trying to think of the best way to show this because what we saw really what we saw was maybe if I if I look at one divided by Bitcoin that'll show up yeah so here you go so what you'll see here is that as Bitcoin right so this again this is one divided by Bitcoin not the price of Bitcoin it's one divided by it so you can see that it it was tracking the ethereum Bitcoin valuation quite well right so if if Bitcoin went up meaning on this chart if it goes down then the ethereum Bitcoin valuation was going down right but also you can see here right Bitcoin USD was going down because it was going up on the chart right so it was going down ether Bitcoin was going up until when until early June why did it change here you can see if you look closely you can see that ether Bitcoin started to roll over before Bitcoin had its rally right it's as clear as day ether Bitcoin rolled over before the rally by Bitcoin USD started so look closely and let's just take a a date range here so ether Bitcoin topped about 10 days before Bitcoin USD found its low what happened you know what happened in early June I'm glad you asked right well you you should know at this point it was in fact when Bitcoin failed to hold the 20-week moving average right early June so ether Bitcoin rolled over so so Bitcoin was going down ether Bitcoin was going up why because Bitcoin was above its 20-week moving average however we know that ether Bitcoin started to go down before Bitcoin found its low before the rally happened why because Bitcoin is below the 20 week SMA okay so it goes back to this idea that we've talked about forever during you know during the the prehabbing year generally speaking and that is in fact that if Bitcoin bounces off the bull market support band then the dominance goes up right if it bounces the dominance generally goes up pretty clear pretty clear and obvious again just overlay the Bitcoin dominance onto the chart if it bounces off the 20 week the dominance goes up if it's in a slow downtrend like this then what happens as long as it's about the 20 week the dominance consolidates right so if you look here if we draw this out right when Bitcoin USD is sort of in this range where it sort of consolidating so too does the Bitcoin dominance consolidation so two does the Bitcoin dominance you get a breakout basically just back to the prior Range High the last time the last time Bitcoin was at 31k the dominance was only at 48 now we're at 31k and the dominant says that almost 52 percent what you're witnessing right now is a rotation of capital from higher risk assets like all coins to lower risk assets like Bitcoin some of those some of that rotation from alts is going into ethereum but ethereum is still bleeding to bitcoin if you go back to the bull market we did whole videos on how a lot of things bleed to eth and that is still true a lot of altcoins are still bleeding to eat you know don't take my word for it just go take a look I mean we we tracked it we track the all ether pairs occasionally as well look at Ada eth you know I mean it it's just been it's been moving down for a long time let me remove all this and try to clean this up a little bit so you can see what I'm talking about right so this is the Ada ether the a to Ether valuation right it's been bleeding for a long time it'll probably get some type of mean reversion at some point look at Ave right I mean it's pumped up a little bit here recently but still it's been a bleeder avax eth has been a bleeder right Dot eth a bleeder b and b e a double top into a bleeder link eth still been a bleeder okay so what you've witnessed is a rotation from the altcoin market to the Blue Chips now I think ethereum is a blue chip but I also think ethereum is bleeding to bitcoin which is why I don't call out the odd ether bleed as much as the Bitcoin bleed again it's because the ether Bitcoin valuation is also bleeding so why why Focus so much on alts bleeding to Ether if if eth is bleeding to bitcoin Bitcoin is inherently a lower risk option and you know this view that I've had on The Ether Bitcoin valuation has been one of the most polarizing views I think um so many people just continue to say while you know ethereum is is holding up strong and I say well and they'll say the tokenomics and whatnot and I mean I agree the tokenomics have changed but you know what the market took that into consideration here at the merge which was a lower high and it's just been one lower high ever since and every single time the ethereum Bitcoin valuation gets a rally you know I have to go to defend this thesis on Twitter uh because everyone starts to come out and and say all sorts of stuff but in the end this has just been a series of lower highs it's also been a series of lower lows okay so I still maintain that the collapse of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation will continue to act as a Tailwind for the Bitcoin dominance for months to come okay for months to come this is what I think I I think that the collapse of the ethereum Bitcoin valuation will lead the Bitcoin dominance much higher if you look by the way at the trend from the last cycle on ethereum's bitcoin valuation you can look at it however you want to you can look at it 2018 or 2019 and you'll see I mean here's one Trend right you get your first move up uh just kind of like over here let me look at this on the on the monthly time frame so it's a little bit cleaner right you still get your first move up your first distribution your second distribution um and then it and then it sort of slowly bleeds for a while and then it it comes back down and note that I think that this here it could sort of be like this right here so this could be one this here could be two right if it comes down here that could be two and maybe then it bounces rolls over and then goes into sort of three which is potentially where it could find a a macro bottom right and I don't really know how I feel about this I don't I you know I'm being honest right I don't know if this is um you know if this is trying to increase on some type of logarithmic growth curve where it's going to come back down to the 0.03 to 0.04 range and then try to build a base off of that and then go higher or if it's or it could also be um you know an oscillator right where it initially gets capitalized and then it just sort of oscillates between um between a range right so it kind of goes up and then it comes down and then it goes up and it goes down right there's a chance that that's the case but the point right the main point here is that the dominance should go higher now a lot of people say well how do you make money on the Bitcoin dollars well the first thing I will say is is by looking at the dominance I would have told you a year and a half ago that the altcoin market is not worth the risk okay it's just simply not and it's not again it's not to say that none of them can't go up it's just to say that collectively Bitcoin is a safer play anytime I see this on Twitter I get a thousand people saying what about XL coin or why all coin or Z altcoin yes you can always cherry pick a few micro caps that have outperformed but when you're talking about the collective altcoin Market you should understand what I mean look at a historical Snapshot from April 16th where Bitcoin was at 30k which is basically where it is today bitcoin's a little bit higher today in fact right so it's a it's at 30.7 here was it at 30.3 look at where ethereum was 2120 where is ethereum today 1882. where was cardano back then 45 cents where is it today 28 cents where was polygon Matic 118. where is it today 67 cents Solana 25 where is Solana today 16 dollars the list can go on and on right Dogecoin nine cents where is it today six and a half cents Litecoin a hundred dollars whereas Litecoin today 88 dollars now there might be a few exceptions um but there's not many xrp 52 cents where is xrp today 48 cents even though bitcoin's higher right xrp went down just like a lot of these all coins went down so I mean you really have to ask yourself right like you know you have to think about this right you have to think about opportunity costs every dollar you put into the crypto verse if you're putting in all these all coins you're essentially just watching them bleed back to the king back to Bitcoin now a lot of times people say well you know what if Bitcoin goes down then what's the what's the point that is the point it's that eventually Bitcoin likely will go back down and and then there's just simply nowhere for the all clean Market to hide because they've already been crushed on their Bitcoin pairs they don't have any support levels to hold anymore on their Bitcoin pairs because they lost their support levels during the Bitcoin USD rally on their Bitcoin pairs take a look at them you know we can go through them look at um at Ada Bitcoin I mean look at where it was exactly four years ago the same level in June 900 satoshi's guess where it was by by Late July 400 satoshi's the talk came in June in 2019 and and actually I think it would have happened around this time um I'm just saying right A lot of these just continue I mean every time I plot these out they just drop lower more or less the next time I look at them link Bitcoin fell below support we said it's likely going to follow Ave Bitcoin and go below its summer low and now it has uni Bitcoin probably gonna take out its summer low from 2022 as well Litecoin Bitcoin even though it's it's having year typically the rally sort of falters sometime by June or July um I wasn't taking my word for it uh let's just pull it up so Litecoin USD um so the yellow lines Mark the havings and normally you can see that the rally by Litecoin phase before the rep before the having actually arrives so just a fair warning okay you can see that in 2015 it peaked in July in 2019 it peaked in in mid-june right now we're in late June so we're getting to that around we're getting near that time where you would expect it for it to fade into the having it's possible that it could push higher but um you know we're in terms of time it's running at a time because once we get close to the having within a few weeks of it Litecoin typically Fades going into it okay so really it's no surprise that even in its having year the Litecoin Bitcoin valuation is still bleeding right I mean it was recently rejected off of its bull Mark scorpion again you know look at look at Solana Bitcoin this is one I've talked about forever about how this pattern emerges this pattern emerges where it goes to a low it rallies back up to the bull market support band only to take out the prior low and put in a new low and every single time it rallies everyone says you know it's going to the Moon right or wherever only for it to get rejected by the 20-week SMA again and to take out that prior low and to put in a new low right and it's just been doing the same thing again it's now gone below this I mean we did put a new low end over here on a wick that was lower than where we are right now but we're putting in weekly closes below where this weekly close was back over here so the same thing's playing out you know and and by the way if you go back and look at at things like Ada Bitcoin and you look at it on a monthly basis you know I've been and I've talked about ADA USD I mean I was I was on my channel of videos where I was buying it at like two cents back in 2019 2020. I was saying this is uh you know and then it went to three dollars but it doesn't mean that you have to marry the altcoin for the duration of its bear Market against Bitcoin you don't right you can think that a project could do well in a bull market in a secular bull market and think that it it has the ability to do well in a bull market scenario but also say you know what if if the macro conditions are are changing then some of these projects that once we're doing quite well can fall against Bitcoin for two years Ada Bitcoin is down 33 this month alone okay I mean you know I've I've gotten into arguments with people on Twitter about this one too and and every single month they say that it's done bleeding and again 33 down this month alone against Bitcoin dot Bitcoin is down for 15 this month alone Solana Bitcoin is down 29 this month alone BNB Bitcoin is down 31 in June this month how do you how do you quantify this for the collective altcoin Market I'm glad you asked right you take total three and you divide it by the Bitcoin market cap at best it's an oscillator at best it's not Slater you go up and you come down and you go up and when you're up here knowing everything's you're gonna break back down but guess what we tend to break back down and when we likely come back down here maybe by you know Q3 Q4 of this year right maybe a little bit later but we can move down pretty quickly I mean you can see that we were at this level in May of 2019 and we reached these lows by August and the the high for Bitcoin came in June so total three continued to bleed against Bitcoin even once the 2019 high was in for Bitcoin again total three is collectively down 17 against Bitcoin this month alone right this month alone if you want to throw ethereum into the mix and look at total two divided by Bitcoin you will in fact see that it is Fallen below support we are now at levels we have not been at since April of 2021. the Bitcoin rally purpose is to break the collective altcoin market off of their Bitcoin support levels so that when Bitcoin USD corrects the altcoin market has nowhere to hide if you looked at the Bitcoin dominance 18 months ago and just note it to yourself hey this dominance is pretty low it's probably going to go up for two years like it did over here if you just noted that and ignored all the gurus telling you about all these altcoins and and whatnot if you just ignored all of it and said you know what dominance is likely going to rally for two years you have been much better off right you would have been much better off had you just done that because the dominance continues to rally and every single time I put out a tweet about it or make a video about it you know there's there's all sorts of people saying that well this is going to be the top and every single time it proves them wrong if you look at at sort of the daily time frame on the Bitcoin dominance you will see that has been bouncing off the 100 day we talked about this on Twitter in fact you know I put out a tweet on Twitter when we were at this point saying that we were likely about to bounce whether Bitcoin held the line or not and that's the point right it's not you don't have to predict the Bitcoin USD to figure out what way the dominance is likely going to go right all you have to know is if Bitcoin holds the line at the 20 week or the bull Mark scorpion 20 week estimate the 21 qma dominance goes up and if it doesn't dominance goes up so I continue to ask myself for the last 18 months what's the point of buying all coins if if all they're going to do is likely bleed on their Bitcoin pairs what's the point you're taking on more risk for Less reward and and these people think they're right all the way down right all the way down they'll say well okay now it's a double bottom or it's a slightly lower low or it's an accumulation phase and what ends up happening their altcoin just keeps pushing lower on their Bitcoin pairs again the all coin Reckoning is not about all coins on their USD pairs I've explained this many times I mean they'd go down on their UFC pairs that's an artifact of it but the main point is that they go down on their Bitcoin pairs again look at this Bitcoin is at its yearly High total three is twenty percent below it's April High I said back over here that the highest I really thought total three would go in this rally was the low 400 billion range and that's more or less where it topped out the reason why I said that was because I was under the impression that we would not take out this high from 2022 this November High I did not think we would take that out and so far we haven't right eventually we probably will take it out eventually I'm not a Perma bear on the altcoin market okay I'm not it's just that you have to recognize that when total three does eventually make a sustained move back up to the upside it doesn't have to be because your altcoin is doing so it could be due to a new class of all coins that are doing well maybe a few of them for the prior from the prior cycle will do well but most of them will become relics of a prior cycle and no one will care about them anymore so again if if the path for total three let's just draw a potential path here right if the path does something like this right and then it finally starts to recover and go this way when it's back up here it doesn't mean that you're all coin is near is back near its highs it could just mean that some fancy new altcoin is going up 20x and and all the money's slowing into that right that's why I've said over and over and over it's dangerous to DCA into the collective altcoin market during a bear Market year and a pre-halving year for Bitcoin if you're going to DCA into something Bitcoin is by far the safer play right why because if Bitcoin goes up you get that exposure to bitcoin you get that exposure to the cryptiverse if it goes down then you can still use the Bitcoin that you have to buy all coins likely for a cheaper evaluation not all of them but some of most of them right again just go take a look where were the all coins 10 months ago or 12 months ago I mean look at the Ada Bitcoin used to be at 6 000 satoshi's now it's down to 900. remember what I said back 18 months ago that these all coins will become a shell of their former selves is that not what's happening dot Bitcoin and by the way look at Ada Bitcoin um look how far down it is from this high it's down 85 percent look at dot Bitcoin how far down is it oh look I mean the last time I measured it was down 81 now it's down 83 percent you might say well is that enough I don't know you tell me I mean last cycle ate a Bitcoin went down 95 now there's this idea of diminishing losses and we can talk about that um but on their Bitcoin pairs I don't know if that's true you might say well the altcoin's better than it was four years ago well so is Bitcoin right you're not comparing the altcoin to a static version of Bitcoin that remains unchanged there's been a lot of new development developments in Bitcoin over the last four years we have institutions filing for all these spot ETFs we have a lot more people interested in Bitcoin today than they were four years ago so don't compare your altcoin to what Bitcoin was four years ago compare your altcoin compared to compare all coin to what Bitcoin is today and if you do that I don't really think you can make the case that they're anything more than oscillators at best right they're also in my opinion most of them are oscillators at best so that means still that ADA Bitcoin could still fall another 50 percent from here do you think that back in you know when I was buying Ada back over here do you think that I thought it was going to go to 400 satoshi's hell no no the people the people that thought that they were clueless insane in my in my eyes there's no way that it could do something like that and what what happened Ada Bitcoin dropped after it rallied to 10 cents in 2019 it then dropped back down 80 percent again and I was wrecked okay I don't tell you this stuff because it makes me any friends it doesn't it just leads to everyone hating what I have to say but I'm telling you I've lived through it before this is the altcoin Reckoning they get wrecked on their Bitcoin pairs pretty much constantly and they get wrecked on their USD pairs when Bitcoin rolls over people just don't think they're people don't think their altcoin is getting wrecked because when Bitcoin goes up it kind of drags everything up with it but you get a slight correction Bitcoin rallies back up to its prior high at 31. where would where would total three be how high does total three need to Rally to get back up to its prior High 24 what's interesting is that its prior high is still lower than the November 2022 High whereas Bitcoin if you look at it's November 2022 High it's it's far surpassed it right far surpassed it about 40 above it look at this chart look how total market cap has more or less just been going sideways more or less wait a second bitcoin's up how is this going sideways because the money is rotating from the altcoins into Bitcoin this is the Bitcoin dominance rally and the dominance rally goes up when Bitcoin goes up and it goes up when Bitcoin goes down okay if you're curious as to when an altcoin might have actually found a low against Bitcoin look at this pattern from Ada Bitcoin back in in 2019. look here it found a low and held that low in a Bitcoin USD downtrend okay so not initially though so Bitcoin USD was starting going down starting in June Ada Bitcoin continued to go down Bitcoin USC continue to go down but at some point Ada Bitcoin was done bleeding 80 USD was not done bleeding until way over here but you'll see that ADA Bitcoin was holding these lows during a Bitcoin USD downtrend that starts to tell you that the altcoin market could become worth the risk right now you're still seeing Ada go down more or less than a Bitcoin uptrend as crazy as that sounds right as crazy as that sounds awsd has gone down in a Bitcoin uptrend you don't believe me if you don't believe me just take a look look at um 80 USD it recently put in a new low as recently as just like three or four weeks ago how is Ada putting in a new low when bitcoin's putting in new highs how it's dot putting in new lows when Bitcoin is putting in new highs link is putting in new lows when Bitcoin is putting in new highs I mean off by a couple weeks right I mean I'm not trying to say that it was today that these all coins put in a new low but you're still seeing these all coins at their range lows or lower than where they were back in 2022 just a couple weeks ago even though Bitcoins back up at its at its yearly High again it's the altcoin Reckoning it's where all coins get racked against Bitcoin on their Bitcoin they get wrecked on their Bitcoin pairs that liquidity flows back to bitcoin it's hard to know exactly where that liquidity for Bitcoin dries up to the point where it can no longer hold the line right it's hard to know how long if you look closely you will see in 2018 during the drop by Ether Bitcoin Bitcoin rally here up until ether Bitcoin got to around 0.058 right now it's a 0.061 in 2019 Bitcoin rallied until Ada Bitcoin got to around 800 satoshi's seven to eight hundred satoshi's right now it's at 900 satoshi's so you can learn a lot about the cryptoverse by looking at these these cryptocurrencies on their Bitcoin pairs the liquidity is Flowing from the altcoin market to bitcoin I can't be sure as to where we turn over where I can't be sure exactly where Bitcoin rolls over and heads back the other way what I can what I feel like I'm sure about which even then I'm not sure about but what I feel somewhat convinced of is that no matter what Bitcoin USD or sorry Bitcoin dominance will go up whether Bitcoin rolls over or not we've seen Bitcoin Hold the Line we know what happens when that happens dominance goes up we've seen what happens when Bitcoin goes below the 20 week dominance goes up so I have to ask myself what's the point of holding alts you know what's the point and normally you know normally when I say this you know you're going to have some type of rally by the altcoin market at some point and then everyone will say well you know what about altcoins but it doesn't change the fact that they just continue to bleed month after month after month against Bitcoin and they probably will continue to do so for at least a few more months the reason why you know we might have to rein in um the Maxi had at some point is because normally once you get to around September uh the dominance turns back the other way from whatever Direction it was headed okay so like if you look at 2022 dominance was going down into it and we talked about how it will likely go back up when it gets through it and it did if you look at at 2021 you'll see a very similar thing right I mean it wasn't sustained for as long but dominance went down into September and then it turned back the other way and then and then look at 2020. dominance was going down into September and then it went up after it and then look at 2019 dominance was going up into September and then it rolled over into the latter part of the year and then look at 2018 dominance was going up into September and then it rolled over into the latter part of the year and then the list goes on and on right and we could we could talk about this forever but you'll more or less see the same thing over and over and over again right dominance going down in September and then it went up going into the latter part of the year so this September could Mark a temporary turning point for the dominance it doesn't have to be a permanent stop you could see something like this right where the Dominus rallies up to 60 by September pulls back to 55 by by the having right and then goes up even more in late 2024 early 2025 right you could see something like that I mean this dominance here it was at 73 in January of 2021. just something to think about right I mean I'm just saying I'm not saying you know what I'm saying right and this is the point is is that look at the year-to-date Roi and the prehabbing years for Bitcoin 2015 2019 and 2023 all of these years into the year positive ethereum did not in 2019. even though Bitcoin into the year up 2x ethereum closed below its yearly open look at ethereum today my guess good chance it could close below the yearly open by the end of the year it almost seems like this year is a tempered version of 2019. does it not at one point we started off ahead of it right but ever since then I mean it seems like somewhat of a tempered version of it look at Ada you know look at Ada by the way I'll say one more thing if you think that I'm just picking on certain all coins because I like to pick on them honestly I feel like if I talk about an altcoin a lot that should be in my view it's more of a compliment it means hey I'm interested enough to follow it so maybe one day I'll actually buy it you know um it's nothing personal it's just business but look at Ada USD in 2019 over here compared to now again it's just a tempered version of what happened in 2019. and look what happened in the back half of the year look at these on their Bitcoin pairs look at Ada Bitcoin in 2019 compared to 2023 . look at this chart right look at it look at ether Bitcoin in 2019 compared to 2023. you can you can go on and on right I mean we could we could look at this for a long time maybe Litecoin Litecoin Bitcoin 2019 versus 2023 you should get the idea okay again total market cap has gone sideways for the most part minus a few hundred billion right Bitcoins at the yearly highs so how the hell is total market cap at the same thing it was that bitcoin's pushing higher it's because the altcoin market is losing valuation look at the dominance excluding stable coins you know one of the biggest things I see is that people say well you know the dominance exclu includes stable coins therefore it shouldn't matter anymore you know because stablecoins take up a significant portion of the market cap and to some degree they're right I mean if you look at usdt um plus uh usdc plus die plus the busd market cap sorry I think I misspelled no I got it right 115 billion and total Market is 1.15 trillion so the stablecoin market cap takes up approximately 10 percent of the of the entire market cap but it's also in a downtrend it's also a downtrend and really where the altcoin market collapsed by the way is when total three look at this collapse right here is when it took out this March low you know why that's interesting is because um and this is a bit of a tangent but if you go look at at total assets by the Fed I've been tracking this right it's almost about to go below its March low and you could make a case that the s p is is is potentially trying to find some type of of local time okay um it doesn't have to be you know a major top but it could at least be a local time so I I do think this is important to track but look listen I mean the stable coin Market it has been going down this is also a Tailwind for dominance because you know you if if this is going down that I think people are likely going to just seek the relative safety of Bitcoin over all coins if they're if they're not going into stables and if they are going into Cash they're probably not going to go into Stables as likely they're just going to go into USD because maybe they don't trust the stable coin market after everything has happened so but my here's the point though despite the fact that the stablecoin market took up such a large percentage of the market cap you know one of the things I see on Twitter is people say well dominance goes lower every cycle I'm like what chart are you looking at because I don't know what university you're living in but in my universe that's not true in my universe the one that I'm living in the cryptoverse that I'm living in what do I see I see An Inconvenient Truth is that the dominance went lower in 2018 than it ever did in 2022 and by the way the stablecoin market in 2019 was like 4 billion right so despite the fact that you had all this money in stable coins the dominance could still not put in a new low so how can you even say that dominance moves lower every cycle how can we say that we can't this is a a higher low a macro higher low now also we're witnessing lower highs as well if you connect these dots you can see the 60 level right well this is a log scale maybe you should um look at it on a linear scale since it's a um since it's the dominance 59 right could easily go above it but there's no guarantee that it has to break back down you know what happens if it if it rallies up into September gets rejected at like 60 percent comes back down and then breaks out the following year and does something like this you know there is a chance that it's an oscillator there's a chance that this is the initial capitalization of the altcoin market right here and that it turns into an oscillator as time goes on meaning that rather than continue to go down forever maybe it just stays in this range for uh for a long time where it just sort of goes back and forth rather than continues to go down right like there's a chance that this is the case and if this is the case then it could go it could go above 60 percent right if this is how it plays out again you know when you look at something like total three divided by Bitcoin kind of looks like an oscillator you know if it can go up to one more than once and if it can go down to 0.25 more than once currently it's at 0.55 I put forth the idea that total three could easily drop another 50 against Bitcoin think about how crazy that is I mean the all coin Market's already wrecked enough and if Bitcoin goes up to say 35k that's going to keep getting wrecked on their Bitcoin pairs I don't care about their USD pairs don't tell me about their USD pairs it's irrelevant because look what happens the minute Bitcoin rolls over all those all coins are most of them they just get decimated look what happened to Ada Carta or look at what happened to Ada Solana polka dot and Avalanche and chain link and and Matic look at what happened to all of them when Bitcoin rolled over even though it was temporary even though Bitcoin has gone back to its yearly High those all coins got crushed on their Bitcoin Pairs and their USD Pairs and most of them have not recovered to where they were even though Bitcoin has so when I look at this I can't help but think that the altcoin market needs to drop another 50 percent against Bitcoin it's gonna happen in my opinion as Bitcoin goes up or down doesn't matter it's irrelevant to me the point is that the altcoin market should lead back to bitcoin so when you look at the dominance of Bitcoin including Stables even though you're including Stables which people will say is a reason to ignore the dominance it's still put in a higher low how is that not bullish for the Bitcoin dominance right it's still put in a higher low when you exclude Stables which is arguably a better way to look at it higher lows since 2018. even this here this new low here compared to January 2022 right so you can see September 2022 went lower than January 2022. this was including Stables when you exclude Stables dominance was putting in higher lows since May of 2021. we've been making videos on about this forever about how every time this comes back down everyone gets all up in arms about how the all coin markets are performing all I see are higher lows and if you overlay a 30-day moving average you can see this massive base getting built out to go higher look at a 90-day moving average of it we've talked about this forever as well you could overlay the total Market or the total summary risk of Bitcoin onto the Bitcoin dominance might be a useful exercise and you can see that you know perhaps this move here was sort of this one and then we're in sort of the secondary move where it goes up as Bitcoin rallies and then kind of Fate the Bitcoin USD evaluation and risk goes back down as the dominant sort of Fades but I don't think we're there yet right I think we're still in this process where the dominance is just going up look at monthly returns in pre-halving years okay 2015 half green half red see well maybe seven green seven green five red 2019 six red six green 2023 five green one rod what happens the next six months I don't know but I can't tell you that in 2019 five of the first six months were green as well and then five of the last six were red so again my my my the idea that I've said for a long time is that in the prehabbing year Bitcoin spends about half the year going up and half the year going down it's hard to know exactly what in what order but what normally happens is that both bulls and bears get sufficiently wrecked on the on the USD Pairs and all and the altcoin gets marked the altcoin market gets wrecked on their Bitcoin pair for basically the entirety of the Year Okay so but the more important thing is is looking at at say ethereum Bitcoin monthly returns we talked about this going into June that starting from June to December it's not a great time for for ethereum on its Bitcoin pair on average it goes down eight percent in June large standard deviation sure it's down it's down eleven and a half percent in June so far look at the prehabbing years 2019. five of the last seven months were read okay 2015 we only have it for the last five months of the year they were all red on their Bitcoin on bitcoin pair look at Ada Bitcoin in 2019 only only five of the months were green but but three of those months that were green were only green by like one percent the red months were like 20 losses negative 22 percent negative 20 negative 27 negative 16 negative 26 here's a negative 14 percent so this is the idea right this is the idea this is how I mean look at look at Solana Bitcoin since October negative seven percent negative 48 negative 27 up 72 everyone loses their Collective Minds then down eight down twenty one up five down two down 29. ultimately it just finds itself back near its its low on its Bitcoin pair despite that crazy rally in January it's back to its lows this is the all coin Reckoning and I've said for a long time that until the ethereum Bitcoin valuation collapses it should provide a Tailwind for the Bitcoin dominance remember in the end even the Giants will fall and that includes ethereum this here was a fake out just like every other one this is a new low now yes if you look at it on a daily time frame maybe you could argue that it could get some type of a bounce okay but I'm telling you right even if it does even if it does I still think it eventually resolves to the downside okay I still think it eventually resolves to the downside just as it has been since late 2021 lower highs since late 2021. and this is the this is the thing right I mean I I think it will likely come back down to that 0.05 level maybe find some type of of relief for a little bit and then roll over into that .03 to 0.04 range okay and that's ultimately where I see it ending up um and again it was just a fake out so when you go around the cryptoverse and people tell you that the Bitcoin dominance doesn't matter because you can't trade it or anything the dominance would have told you 18 months ago that all coins were not worth the risk and since then the altcoin market just continues to more or less bleed you will always have people that will tell you to buy the dip on the altcoin market you will always have people that will say that eventually total three will probably put in new highs most of the altcoins that made up the highs over here will likely not make up whatever its new high is going to be those will likely become a relic of a prior cycle except for a few there will likely be a few that will go on to take out their prior highs I've seen it happen multiple times there it's happened I mean look ethereum took out its prior highs in the last cycle cardano took out its prior highs it can happen you can see some coins go to new Highs but most of them will probably not that is a fact okay we've seen this many many times most of them are scams actually so when people tell you that the Bitcoin dominance doesn't matter show them the altcoin market chart on its Bitcoin pair and ask them why really since the end of November alts are down 48 against Bitcoin if the dominance doesn't matter why are some of these all coins putting in new lows as recently as three weeks ago the Dominus would have told you all this that their the risk is not justified right I would have said this all so remember at the end of the day the the thing that I want to make sure that I do is is to try to be as honest as I can I don't get everything right that's that's for sure like we know that I do not get everything right I get a lot of things wrong we can be honest about that but when you look at things like the altcoin season index we talked a lot about how it's likely going to go into Bitcoin season and stay there for a long time and now it's doing that right and this is the 90 day if you look at the 30 day you can see that it just collapsed all the way back down so the 90 day will likely also come back down look at a 30-day moving average of it right I think it's gonna I think it's gonna fall back in there's also some idea too that this 20 the 2018 move here or sorry the 2022 move by this index looks more like 2019 and perhaps this one looks more like 2018. I mean look at it it came to the same level right and when it went back up it wasn't because all coins were done bleeding it was just because they eventually were done bleeding on their Bitcoin pairs for a little bit and they still collapsed on their on their USD pairs so you know I I say all this stuff just to sort of remind you that the altcoin market can bleed for far longer than you think look at cardano's last bear Market if it were to play out the same way it would mean it doesn't find a low until November now you might say that that was a Black Swan but guys look we're still looking at an inverted yield curve okay and I don't know what they're going to call it a Black Swan whatever it ends up being but when you have treasure yield spreads look like this it doesn't normally resolve in a positive manner the market can rally like the s p can rally during the inversion process right I mean it historically can do that we see that we've seen that occur many many times it can go up during that time it's the uninversion process that's what that what that's what hurts that's What Hurts the Most right it's the uninversion process and we're not there yet okay so again when someone tells you and because they'll tell you this right when someone tells you that the Bitcoin dominance does not matter ask them why did it put in a higher low compared to 2018 if it includes stable coins if it doesn't matter then why are all coins continuing to bleed for the last year and a half on their Bitcoin pairs if it doesn't matter ask them why why they're putting money into these into these random all coins when they just bleed back to the kink okay I'm not saying they're gonna bleed forever but I'm saying they've been bleeding for the last year and a half and we've been talking about it every step of the way and people faded every step of the way and every month they just more or less go lower remember in the end even the Giants will fall and that does include ethereum okay on its Bitcoin pair and you can see it right 0.06116 remember the Bitcoin dominance is the key to unlocking the secrets of the cryptographers thank you guys for tuning in make sure you subscribe give the video a thumbs up again check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at into the at into the cryptiverse.com I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2023-06-27 00:00:00,"The video discusses the importance of Bitcoin dominance as a key metric for understanding the crypto market. The speaker argues that during the current stage of the market cycle, Bitcoin dominance is likely to increase, leading to a rotation of capital from altcoins to Bitcoin. This is based on historical patterns observed during the pre-halving and bear market years, where Bitcoin dominance has typically risen.The speaker provides extensive technical analysis of various altcoin/Bitcoin pairs, showing a consistent trend of altcoins bleeding against Bitcoin. The overall sentiment is bearish on the altcoin market, with the speaker advising that Bitcoin is a safer play compared to investing in the collective altcoin market. The speaker cites examples of altcoins like Cardano, Solana, and Ethereum, which have continued to underperform against Bitcoin, even as Bitcoin reaches new highs.The speaker emphasizes that the altcoin reckoning is underway, and investors should focus on Bitcoin to maximize risk-adjusted returns. The speaker argues that despite the inclusion of stablecoins in the dominance calculation, Bitcoin dominance has still put in higher lows since 2018, indicating a bullish trend. The speaker also discusses the historical patterns of Bitcoin's performance in pre-halving years, noting that the current year appears to be a tempered version of 2019, where Bitcoin outperformed Ethereum.The main message is that the altcoin market is likely to continue bleeding against Bitcoin, and investors should be cautious about investing in altcoins, as the liquidity is flowing back to Bitcoin. The speaker advises that even the giants like Ethereum are not immune to this trend and may see further downside against Bitcoin.",342,"[0.015235901, -0.034698486, 0.013259888, 0.004760742,

Hi, today we're going to take a look at the S P 500 return on investment after yield curve inversion if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out the sale on into the crypto virus premium uh into the cryptiverse.com let's go ahead and jump in now we have spoken somewhat frequently about the yield curve and how it is useful in understanding macro economic conditions and right now you will see again that the yield curve does in fact remain inverted and it has been inverted for quite some time we can scroll back the clock here and see that it really started to become at least parts of it became started to become inverted as as early as late 2022 and of course it's been inverted more or less ever since if you were to get it go back in time and find other examples where we had yield curve inversion there was a period before the 2007 recession uh or the 2008 2009 recession where we had yield curve inversion uh there was a period before the.com recession that we had yield curve inversion and then also going back to to the 1990s um we don't actually have it on here but this was the recession and then of course just before it we had an inverted yield curve so one of the things that I think it's important to remind ourselves of is that unlike you know things like cryptocurrency the macro stuff can take a very long time to play out I mean sometimes it can take years for it to ultimately play out again if you were to go back to 2007 we had an inverted yield curve and the market didn't really start to get you know pretty nasty until a year or two later you know your year and a half later so again this stuff can take quite a long period of time now to visualize yield curve inversions you of course can also pick out two specific time frames and compare them for instance when when the economy is is healthy you would argue that you know lower duration treasuries would yield less than than longer duration treasuries but when you're when the economy is is kind of sick you'll often see things like where the three month is is providing a better um yield at least annualize and then say something like the tenure so what we're going to look at are treasury yield spreads okay so this is the spread of the 10-year and the three months and again as you can see normally during the inversion process we are not in a recession right that's not typically what we see during the inversion it's not to say that it can't ever happen like you can see from the 1980s but oftentimes especially when you go into an inversion you're not in a recession in fact if someone just told you in the future some random date in the future that hey on this date in this year we're gonna see we're gonna we're gonna see the three month invert the tenure and they asked you do you think we're going to be in a recession when that occurs you're probably better off answering no because again normally when we become when it becomes inverted you're not in a recession and it can take quite some time for us to actually get to the uninversion process to give you an example in 2000 uh the doc just before the.com crash and in the summer you can see that we had inverted yield curve but it didn't we didn't become uninverted right until about what six months later or so it was longer during the financial crisis we had an inversion back over here in July 2006 the market kept pushing higher for basically another year or maybe slightly more maybe about 14 months before it actually topped out now just because it had this rally right here during the inversion process did not mean that the market was immune to to what could theoretically occur after it right I mean and sort of zooming out here even though we became inverted here the market rallied for you know well over a year and we still eventually took out that entire rally it just took a long time to do so right it took a long time to do so and remember that the markets will make fools of both sides right in 2022 we made fine uh the market sort of um made a joke of of the Bulls in 2023 so far it's more or less made a joke of the Bears and and this is what the market does right it's what the market does but you can see that even in this yield curve inversion even though we still slightly went higher eventually the market did did roll over and I think the bigger question is well how long could this actually take I mean you know the process of the inversion of three month and tenure um we've seen it we've seen it last a few months over here by the way if you're curious from inversion to uninversion it was almost it was about a year at least once it was sustained about a year and for this cycle we didn't get our inversion of the three months of the tenure uh really until October of 2022. so you know we're only a few months away right July August September October just four months from now it will have been an entire year since we saw the three month and the 10 the and the 10-year experience that inversion that's nothing out of the ordinary it's not right and history shows us that the s p you know will climb the wall of worry it can for some time but you still have to deal with the eventual resolution of the yield curve right whether it happens three months from now six months from now nine months or 12 months it's really hard to know it really is and you know you're not going to find a more concrete answer for me right it's hard to know exactly when the uninversion process will take place if you're gonna go look at what the bond market is predicting they're constantly changing their minds only you know at the beginning of this year the market was pricing in rate Cuts as early as now now as early as June or July and now the the the bond market is basically saying there's not going to be any rate Cuts until 2024. the fed you know at this meeting last week Powell said they don't Envision rate Cuts until for two years so again there does seem to be a fair uh you know a fairly strong disconnect between what's going on uh over with the fat over at the fat and what the what the bond market thinks and of course the s p just can as it has and continues to to sort of just climb the wall of worry okay now at some point we're going to likely see this uninvert right and if you zoom in to the uninversion process right it's like the.com crash the uninversion process the s p was already had already rolled over during this uninversion process the s p did continue to climb up just a little bit more and during this uninversion process back over here you can see that the s p climbed up just a little bit more but in all three cases we did eventually go into a recession on the other side of it okay and you can look at the spread on the 10-year and the two-year as well and and that might be you know informative too you know we've we've been this one's been inverted even longer right going all the way back to July of 2022. so the two year and the 10-year have been inverted for almost a year already and they had a brief inversion as early as April of 2022 but it wasn't sustained until July is this out of the ordinary not really right I mean over here we had an inversion we briefly put back above it but from this first inversion you know like in late 2005 we didn't come out of this until early 2007. so again some sometimes this you know the the inversion process the inversion the amount of time that we see the old curve inverted can last over a year right sometimes even longer a year and a half or sometimes even longer than that so we have to be aware of this of this potential reality and even during the 1980s you know we were inverted for for quite a long period of time and you know eventually eventually we got you know we saw an uninversion and and of course during this process we ultimately did go into a recession You could argue that during periods of high inflation we are more likely to go into a recession before it uninverts and the reason why the reason for that could be due to you know a more um uh a more hawkish fat right more resistant to wanting to cut rates because of high inflation and so they might just stay the course of it longer than they otherwise would have so there are of course periods where you can see a recession during an inversion but what you will often find is that the time at the time in which the the curve does become inverted right when the two year inverts the tenure you're often not looking at a recession at that time it doesn't mean that you can't go into one at some point during the inversion but oftentimes when you're not experiencing High inflation you will see a recession come after the uninversion and then sometimes when you're experiencing High inflation the recession can come still why the still while the yield curve is in fact inverted but I thought it would be interesting to sort of plot out here how the s p has performed uh after yield curve inversion right doesn't that seem like a useful exercise so just algorithmically if you were to go back for several decades you know going back to the early 1980s and just sort of plot out what the s p does after an inverted yield curve of more than like just like a day it has to be inverted for a few days if it's just like a single day we throw it out this is what you ultimately get so this is the S P 500 Roi too low after yield curve inversion and if we ignore the current one this is what it normally looks like right so normally you you can get a rally after it but eventually we do see it typically roll over this was the.com crash over here this was the financial crisis this was 1989 you can see the 1989 rallied on up uh to a pretty nice level uh you know over 1X um or over over basically where it become became inverted right so like it didn't just go down the minute that the old curve inverted it actually went up for a while and stayed as stayed above one for as long as you know about two-thirds of a year or so before It ultimately came back down now if you overlay the current cycle you can see that we've outperformed even the most optimistic case that we've had in the past which was I believe 1989. so if you were to throw on here let me find the right one because there were several several of them so 1989 and then I want to Overlay the current one right so this is an example where the market rallied and it still eventually rolled over um you know once once things got got bad enough I do think that it's important to consider just the longevity of of you know of this process right like just how long it can take and it can take a really long time for this to play out now arguably you could say well is this time different normally going down that path is a fairly dangerous path to go down because normally it's not different right sometimes the amount of time it takes uh is different right normally that's different but the end result is usually not different and so I guess the question is is well how long can can this go on until it finally rolls over and history shows us that um at this point you know we've outperformed at least going back to the early 1980s we've outperformed all of those now there are some unprecedented events this business cycle for instance the FED printing six trillion dollars also do note that we did have um you know a fairly long downturn in the S P 500 just before um or a right or you know just before we we got into some of this conversion inversion process but at the end of the day you know we still have to eventually come to terms with the uninversion process and you know it's hard to say exactly how high equities can rally until that time I will be completely honest and say that they've gone higher than I thought they would okay um they have I I didn't really think they would they would go this high but they have and and here we are uh so we need to we need to be aware of of how Equity markets can in fact do this uh just to give you kind of an example here I was looking at this earlier um uh the Russell 2000 you know at least last cycle we put in a low in 2018 and then we rallied even through the yield curve inversion and even after it it inverted or after it uninverted and then it still ended up putting in a new low we actually saw something similar in 2014 we didn't have an inverted yield curve but we put in a low in the in sort of the midterm year we rallied and then put in a lower low in the presidential election year um so it's interesting to see if something like that would play out where it you know it rallies and then eventually puts in a new low uh maybe maybe sometime early next year or or later on this year but I did think that this was an interesting concept sort of plot out the ROI uh too low after yield curve inversion and do note that this 2022 one and 2023 one is assuming uh that the lowest still to come right I mean all these other ones we have the advantage of hindsight where we can look to see did the low come later or did it not during this process we don't actually know for instance if the s p does eventually drop but it puts in say a higher low than the low would have already happened if it puts in a lower low then it makes sense to continue plotting this but at this point right it's still too early on in the process to to fully know why we just simply cannot know at this time and we can also plot this for you know Roi to low after say the the inversion of of the two year and the ten year and see what that looks like and you know from this process what's going on right now doesn't really look that out of the ordinary uh with that said it still has rallied longer at this point in time than all these other Cycles going back to the late 1970s there was once one cycle though that actually had a that topped out just north of where it is today although it topped out a lot earlier right it still it still eventually topped out and I'm sure you can guess which one that was it was of course 2019 right so in 2019 if we take a a closer look at this you can see that It ultimately rallied um a fairly significant amount after the inversion of the two-year and the tenure and it convenient it continue to Rally even after the old curve uninverted but then at some point we got the pandemic and then and then sort of the bottom fell out right so a lot of things to consider here hopefully you guys enjoy the content if you do make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up again you can check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium and and you can get access to charts like this so make sure you check out that check that out links in the description below I'll see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2023-06-21 00:00:00,"The video discusses the historical relationship between yield curve inversions and the performance of the S&P 500. It notes that while yield curve inversions have often preceded recessions, the market can continue to rally for an extended period after the inversion, sometimes over a year. The video presents data showing the S&P 500's return on investment (ROI) after past yield curve inversions, and observes that the current cycle has outperformed previous ones. However, it cautions that the market will eventually have to come to terms with the uninversion process, and that the timing of the eventual downturn is difficult to predict. The overall sentiment is cautiously bullish, acknowledging the market's resilience but recognizing the historical precedent of recessions following yield curve inversions.",152,"[0.04336548,

Hi, today we're going to talk about the total cryptocurrency market capitalization and discuss what is the worst case scenario or at least what I would consider to be the worst case scenario if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and also check out into the cryptographers premium at into the cryptiverse.com we of course do have different tiers available including a free one so make sure you check that out link is in the description below we sent out a Weekly Newsletter um for the free tier now what I want to do is I want to go through systematically the discussions that we previously had provide an update as to where we are right now and talk about the potential implications for the future now I am going to go through this systematically it is going to be repetitive if you've watched the prior videos so there's a good chance you already know what I'm going to say be that as I may I'm still going to go through the motions anyways okay so just a fair warning now a couple of caveats one caveat is that it's called the worst case scenario okay first of all just because I think of something as the worst case scenario doesn't mean that it is I could be wrong about the worst case scenario second of all um I do also understand that theoretically the worst case scenario is that everything goes to zero now I know a lot of people might just assume that I'm always bearish on crypto if you've watched the channel over the last year but you might be surprised to know I'm actually very long-term bullish on crypto and I think you'll see that side of me come back out probably probably within the next half year or so okay so fair warning if you you know if you are bearish and you've been following me for a while because I'm you know I lean in the same direction as you have I will be more than likely pivoting my stance uh within the next six months or so and I I just want to you know I just want to mention that and and just sort of be upfront about it so one of the things that I think we need to to talk about here is we first need to get grounded as to how we got here in the first place and why we're making the comparison in the first place the.com crash that occurred more than 20 years ago has thus far served as a fairly accurate analog as to what cryptocurrency is going through I think you could make the case that this is our.com crash now that might be scary to a lot of people but when I look at the.com crash I just think of how lucky people would have been had they stuck around for the entirety of the bear market and then continue to watch the next bull market take take shape generational opportunities were found in that okay these opportunities don't come around very often in the same way that people might have doubted the future of of tech stocks way back then I think they're going to doubt crypto today but when we look back on this phase in in 10 to 20 years I think it will have been very obvious that we are just going into a generational opportunity for the cryptocurrency asset class all right now I want to be clear that that is where I stand I do think there's reason to believe that prices could easily go lower and and we're going to talk about that in this video okay so this all started you know more than a year ago when we kind of acknowledged hey there's actually a lot of eerie similarities between the crypto crash that we're experiencing and the.com crash that occurred again more than 20 years ago one of the similarities is the fact they essentially both peaked at approximately 3 trillion another similarity is that you had the.com stocks overtake the Super Bowl in the same way that crypto stocks or not stocks but cryptocurrencies in crypto companies in general overtook the Super Bowl it sort of makes me think like hey if I ever see an ad in the Super Bowl for this you know groundbreaking new technology it's probably going through a bear market right um because to get the type of money that you need for these companies to really get into the Super Bowl you sort of have to go through a bull market and a fairly massive bull market at that and so by the time they have that money to really go throw into Super Bowl ads likely something is is a mess okay um so you have to consider that now again we peaked at around 3 trillion back then in the.com Crash but we also know that crypto peaked at around 3 trillion in this in this cycle right you can see the total market cap at crypto peaked at around 3 trillion now we've followed this series up and by the way I'm going to link all these videos in the description below if you want to go back in time and look at some of the other videos and kind of follow along as to how we got here um so this is one of the First videos and and you know we went systematically through the comparisons between you know what not what the NASDAQ did um and how far it had to drop and over at what time frame that had to occur and and sort of made the comparisons to crypto and I mean you can see that Bitcoin was right around 42k or so just below 42k now we followed this video up um about I mean again this one was over a year ago we followed this video up about nine months ago with another video where we we continued to look at the similarities between these you know between these two um to you know Cycles one one with tech stocks of course 20 years ago and then of course this one with crypto and we also noted that inflation and that high and this High inflation was likely going to you know make the FED extremely hawkish right extremely hawkish and and back then we talked about the dollar likely rallying on up to around the 115 level I mean you can see at the time it was only around 104 right I mean when we talked about this this actual move right the the dollar the US dollar currency index was around 104.7 and we we sort of speculated that we were going to see it climb all the way to around you know just below 116. now again if you go take a look at at the US dollar currency Index this is more or less what what happened right I mean you see back in that video about nine months ago I was writer on these levels 104 and we went up to right around that 114 115 level so again like there are reason reasons to continue to follow this it's it's played out well so far and it could continue to play out it could also deviate at any point and remember it's not about being right or wrong right like it's it's never about being right or wrong it's just about managing your risk and realizing what are these what are potential outcomes and trying to weigh various outcomes in your mind and and then figuring out which ones do you think make make the most sense and then sort of hedging yourself for you know the two most likely scenarios that you could see or something like that right so we we follow the video series up talking about that and then you know half a year ago we did something similar and we really noted the three primary rallies that the tech stocks had back in the.com Crash we had a 40 rally a 50 rally and a 60 rally and unfortunately none of them marked the bottom right none of them did and and we talked about how it looks like this 60 rally could be aligning with a typical crypto bottom that occurs at the end of a year-long bear Market uh you know occurring sometime like November December January February time frame right so we talked about how difficult that might be and then of course we we followed this up three months ago again continuing to talk about this potential 60 rally and then you know we did it again a month ago as we were climbing this 60 rally up to the 50 week estimate and the reason why we did that was because the NASDAQ was also rejected off of the 50-week SMA and then we most recently talked about this when Bitcoin was right at 25k you know I actually made this video and I was I was I was somewhat nervous to put it out because I don't like coming out and being the bad guy and saying you know hey like what if we have to go back down but there's there's something that has happened since this video that I think it's worthwhile to follow up on and I just want to play a very brief clip um now this is not to say that everything I've said in these videos has been 100 accurate I I know that it hasn't and I know the exact path has has you know not been exactly what we necessarily envisioned it would be and it never will be and and even the path that we might put forth in this video it's likely not going to go on that path but one of the things we talked about was also this um this uh weekly RSI maybe we'll get to it here in a little bit but I just want you to remember we talked about the weekly RSI uh I'll go ahead and show it I guess we talked about this weekly RSI and how and I'll just play the clip so a lower low on price a higher low on the weekly RSI followed by a sixty percent move to the upside which rallied to the 50-week moving average in the same way the NASDAQ did now the weekly RSI ended up putting in a double top the first top did not reach the 50-week SMA the second top went just above it but in in both scenarios the weekly RSI was essentially the same Bitcoin you can see that right now the weekly RSI has broken a little bit higher but of course the leak just started right we we don't know yet how this week's going to end if so that's the point right we talked about how look we broke above this potential double top but the week just started we don't know how it's going to end and so before we get too far into this into this video I want to draw your attention to the fact that if you look at the weekly RSI it ended up being a double top right what happened right it was it was the week wasn't over and and what happened by the end of the week we came back down and look at this look at this comparison here right it ended up being a double top on the weekly RSI in the same way the NASDAQ weekly RSI was in fact a double top more than 20 years ago and you know I I don't imagine this is going to play out exactly forever it does sometimes seem almost too too perfect you know like so it's like something's got to give at some point and you could even argue it's actually deviating a little bit right now I'll explain more about that later because you might say well doesn't it seem like it's the exact same thing there might actually be a small deviation we'll talk a little bit about more about that later in the video but again there are a lot of comparisons and and really the comparison really starts with this same thing right like this 77 drawdown in the NASDAQ okay followed by a 60 rally to the 50 week and remember with Bitcoin one of the things we said right in that video that I just played the clip of is that the first move does not make it to the 50 week but the second one goes above it on Wix right and that's what happened right no no weekly closes above it we had Wix above it just like the NASDAQ did um you know a long time ago so that's where we currently are so we're going to get rid of the weekly RSI um well we might revisit it in a little bit but just keep it in the back of your mind so the NASDAQ had the 77 correction followed by a 60 rally to the 50 week okay now we've seen Bitcoin do the same thing it's the exact same move um so far anyways right you you see that 77 rally to the downside followed by that 60 rally to the 50 week with the double top on the weekly RSI and the rejection off of the 50-week moving average right furthermore we also saw the NASDAQ put in a series of rallies that were quite impressive the first one being about a 40 rally go over to the total market cap you guys remember the rally from from January to March of of 2022 guess what it was about a 40 rally we know that the nasdaq's second primary rally was a 50 move and guess what with total do you guys remember the rally that we had back in the summer of 2022 guess what it was a 50 rally now there are some small deviations here and I think we owe it to ourselves to be fully transparent about about where these things could be deviating um for total this most recent rally was about a a 49 rally so it wasn't really a 60 rally like we had with the.com stocks on that third rally the Counterpoint is that Bitcoins rally was 60 whereas its prior rallies were not exactly the same so if you look at bitcoin's first rally it was about a 40 rally but the second one was only about a 40 certain rally so it's not the exact same thing but you get an idea right there are a lot of similarities between the the tech stock collapse back in in the.com Era and the crypto collapse that we're seeing today right a very a lot of similarities between them and I I think we owe it to ourselves to continue to um to look at these similarities in case they continue to play out so we know the NASDAQ 40 rally 50 rally 60 rally the 60 rally by the way took you to the 50-week SMA and then what happened the final low was actually about 30 below this one the 60 rally so for total where would that put it you know where would where would a 30 where would it put it if we went 30 percent lower below the prior low it would put the total market cap at around 500 billion which represents a sizable correction from the current levels I mean that's 30 below the prior low from the current levels that would represent another 40 to 50 percent correction and again we know that these percentages are subject to slight changes like it's not going to be exact so you know maybe it could be 40 down from here if it's going to follow it or maybe it could be 50 down you know and get you closer to 400 billion I've been fairly consistent I believe in all of these videos on the worst case scenario saying that I think the worst case scenario for for crypto would be somewhere around a 400 to 500 billion market cap for the entire asset class another reason that you might think about it in terms of that is if you take a look at the.com Crash from this peak here it actually crashed over about two and a half years where the entire asset class went down about 83 percent now if you were to take a look at total where would 83 percent down from the peak puts you it would put you right around four to five hundred billion okay which again is still representative of a 40 50 correction from the current valuations now if you take a look at the Wall Street cheat sheet you can see just how similar these bubbles are right the idea of the psychology of a market cycle and if you take a close look at this right you can see you have this capitulation you get the first bounce the second balance is not quite as high as the first balance and it also puts in a new low right it's essentially the same thing and what happens after that right you see it slowly bleed for for about you know about six months about half a year a slow bleed and we actually talked about this in the prior videos is that what happens and I again this is just my interpretation of it I could be wrong okay and I mean you know it's fine if I am but my interpretation of it is everyone wants to front run everything now because everyone's so aware of of the cyclical behavior that they don't really let it just capitulate in the same way that it has in Prior Cycles if you think back to 2018 and 2014 and other Cycles like at the end of the bear Market you had like a 40 50 crash but this time we didn't really get that right like it's just like a pathetic 20 crash um so it it constantly leaves I think people thinking like well is that it or you know is there more and we didn't really get a blow off top like we like we have seen in the past  um but at the same time you might not see a capitulation bottom what if it's just a slow bleed it's a possibility right like it's a possibility what if it's just a slow bleed where people become apathetic and I think this is something we need to continue to to sort of reiterate now one thing that I think we should take a look at as well with the NASDAQ and and with this um with this relative strength index this could help identify where the bottom is if it continues to play out okay so if we take a look here let's look very closely at what actually happened because you had a weekly uh the weekly RSI for the NASDAQ kind of break out um you know break out from these levels okay put in that double top now remember this double top might be akin to you know to Bitcoins recent double top at the 50-week SMA and with a relative strength index okay so let's just go take a look really quick so again you know breaking out of this followed by a double top on the weekly RSI again you sort of Flip Flip back and forth right breaking out double top on the weekly RSI now where did the NASDAQ bottom right where did it hit bottom it bottomed close to a double bottom on the weekly RSI right so if you were to draw a line across you almost got a double bottom but here's the thing that was not the bottom okay what was the bottom was the higher low on the weekly RSI so just kind of like how it was over here um the you you first had a low and then you had a lower low on price but a higher low on weekly RSI right this is a sign of of some type of Divergence where the Bulls would point to and say hey this is this is actually quite bullish yeah the price went lower but the the the the strength is fading for the Bears okay and so you get a Breakout so I think what to look for is do does the weekly RSI come back down to the same level that it was before and if it does it might not actually Mark the bottom it could just be one little pathetic last little bounce followed by a slightly higher low on the weekly RSI with a lower low on price okay so that's what you saw that's what we saw play out back in the.com Crash now if if Bitcoin follows this then what are we looking for here on the weekly RSI because we clear RSI right right now is is all the way up at 45. it would need to go all the way back down to around 25 or so so if you see the weekly RSI come back down to 25 go back up a little bit and then come back down and put in a higher low where a lower low occurs in price that I mean that that could be it right I mean that could be that could be all she wrote for the bear Market if in fact it's not over which again this worst case scenario video is certainly exploring so this is a consideration to make right certainly a consideration worthwhile uh and and Forest it can be following and normally I only provide updates to this video series every every few months or so I know recently we've been doing it more so every two weeks and the reason is because it feels like we're getting into crunch time um and it feels like this is important like it didn't seem like an important deal back a year ago to do it every single week because you know these bear Market rallies they just take months to play out and you have to see the 40 rally manifest itself then you have to say the 50 route and then you have to see the 60 rally and now we've seen all three of those right we've seen the 40 move we saw the 50 move and we saw the 60 move we saw the double top on the weekly RSI and now we're seeing things come back down to earth so where does that where does that lead us to next right where does that lead us to now well I would like to draw your attention to a few other comparisons before we dig a bit further into the weeds okay so um this one's dubious at best okay and I'm not asking you to take it to the bank certainly but suppose that you did take it you know suppose that you did at least take it to heart a little bit um this peak here for the for the NASDAQ back over here in in 2000 guess where it occurred right it occurred at 48.16. all right now is it a coincidence yes it is a coincidence I'm under No Illusion that that this had to have played out in the exact same way but it actually makes the numbers quite easy to compare what else in crypto peaked at around 4 800 right ethereum okay ethereum and and what we're going to do is is we're going to go take a closer look at that okay so we're gonna go take a look at Heath and see where did ethereum exactly peek at 48.67 okay so let's put that on the chart so we'll say 48.67. now where did the NASDAQ get rejected by the 50-week SMA right where did that happen in the.com Crash 1700. let's get the exact number we don't need a hand wave right I mean might as well just get the exact number 1710 I'm not going to do the sense but you get it I mean 17 10. what else just had a rally to the 50-week SMA by the way if you look at this rally right here it was a 60 rally now we but we did put in a lower low over here we'll talk about that a little later but where did this rally take us to it took us to the 50 week where did it Peak at 1745 okay so this is for ethereum you have 1745 on the chart so 48.67 1745 look at the NASDAQ 4816 1710 look guys I'm not saying it has to play out the exact same way but so far history has been rhyming pretty good okay it's been rhyming pretty good um the rally that started this move to the 60 or to the 50-week SMA started at 1088. started at 10. 88. the rally for ethereum started here at 10.73. again I'm not going I we will talk about this capitulation here in a little bit so again you know there are a lot of similarities the question is well where did the NASDAQ bottom right well it bottomed at 7.95. so it bottomed at 7.95. where is ethereum now it's a 1426 so that would represent a sizable pullback from here to go down to 795 would put you 44 down from the current price now here's where it gets a little more interesting you guys know the um the logarithmic regression band that we talk about for ethereum I I reference is like okay when's ethereum gonna come home remember the NASDAQ bottomed at 7.95 the ethereum logarithmic regression band fit2 quote unquote non-bubble data the fair value of it right now is at 791. okay so you know this this band where I think a lot of people just assume we're never going to go back into it because of of you know because of all the all the changes that ethereum's had proof of stake and and you know deflationary aspects of it they don't think it'll happen I contend that it easily Could Happen okay it's just it's so eerily similar that the fair value of the E fit to non-bubble data which is somewhat arbitrary based on my own input so we'll have to take that into consideration but we've had this on the channel for years it's just so funny how after all these years we developed this back in 2019. after all these years the fair value fit to non-bubble data is 791. the NASDAQ is has been giving us a blueprint of this crypto crash for a long time and it bottomed at 7.95 but remember this is a a monotonically increasing function right it's just going to Trend higher so again at 791 today but you know a little bit it'll be at 7.95 right so there are a lot of similarities here still a lot of similarities that I think we we need to keep in mind now I've also made some comments before that the Deep value Zone on Eve is four to six hundred so then you know how do I reconcile that right how do I reconcile that can be hard too sometimes you know like I I think well to me the the the Deep value the real deep value would be four to six hundred is it going to play out I don't know right I mean it could I hope it I I certainly hope it does but does that mean does that mean it's not worthwhile to um to get interested before then probably not you know what if it plays out like the NASDAQ where it goes sub 800 and and then that's it the Counterpoint is that when ethereum really got moving to the downside back over here it was bad and it was a it was a it was a quite a a plunge from the peak okay so from the from the Peak from this initial Peak to this first low before we ended up getting that rally to the 50 week it was an 82 percent drop but whereas the NASDAQ it was only a 77 drop yes it was a lower low ethereum put in a higher low but one of the reasons you could argue it was a higher low was because the first drop was so catastrophic right it was an 82 percent move to the downside the nasdaq's first drop was only a 71 move to downside so yes if you're obviously if you're in eth Bull you're going to look at this and say well this was a higher low but the only reason you could argue it was a higher low is because the first drop was so much more catastrophic than the first drop that the NASDAQ had so something like that could play out again right where it's always possible that ethereum overshoots the fair value just like it overshot the first you know the first draw on the NASDAQ had before it had its rally to the 50 weeks May or not the first one you can see that in in the past we've overshot the fair value here we went below the fair value we went below the fair value right here as well and we went below it over here so if that happens the lower bound on this trend line is 547 so that would get you into that four to six hundred dollar range and we've actually gone below this before so I would say that is still a possibility um but I would also keep that sub 800 level in mind just in case that ends up coming into play here over the next several months okay now here's another comparison okay I told you we're gonna go systematically through this so if you have somewhere to be and pause the video and come back but we're going to go through this very systematically take a look at the length of this bear Market from the.com Crash okay it was 133 weeks that's a long bear Market really long bear Market 133 weeks it's two and a half years in fact now how long has the bear market for crypto been well you could think about this a couple ways you could measure from the peak which is probably where we should measure a foam but most indicators like 99 of indicators that I have that I've created and that also other people have created consistently suggest that April was the top and somehow we just sort of leveraged ourselves up to a new high right but the Mania phase was back in April okay that was when the real Mania phase was interesting with the NASDAQ is that it also peaked at around that same time so if we actually find the the week of the high it was it was you know close to the end of March the the Bitcoin peaked in April a couple weeks later so what's interesting is if you take this time move here and you go out 133 weeks it puts it in October of 2023. go back and look at this chart follow this along where does the bottom come in October right of 2023 right I think this is a um sort of looking at the.com crash like this was October of 2023 so it would have been as measured from the first Peak the one that arguably was more important it would have been a two and a half year bear Market if you measure it from then if you measure it from April and you assume that November was the bottom it was still over a year and a half if you just take November 2021 is the peak then we basically had a pretty typical year-long bear market right and and because of that there's reasons to be hedged you know there's certainly reasons to be hedged not Financial advice but there's always a chance though the bottom is in um and and that it doesn't have to play out in the worst case scenario we have to be aware of that right we have to be I'm not going to sit up here and say that anything has to happen that's a good way to uh to sort of get in trouble if you if you think something has to happen then you're you're not adequately hedged in case it doesn't so we need to consider like well what if what if the bottom isn't one thing to remind yourself of is even at the bottom is in for Bitcoin there's a good chance it's not in for a lot of altcoins now a lot of people have pointed out that the Bitcoin has shown a little bit of weakness recently compared to some other projects but I will remind you that a lot of these all coins on their Bitcoin pairs remain in macro downtrends here's Ada Bitcoin you know there's nothing about this chart that has been screaming it's been it's been showing strength here's dot Bitcoin right there's nothing there's not strength to be seen here yes ethereum has been holding up okay and people would point to that but again it still did technically go down last year and so far this year it still has technically gone down as well so yes we could you know we could say that ethereum's holding up but in the same way you could also point to the idea that it's sort of playing out in a very similar manner as to this over here where you have three red candles two green to get everyone excited followed by the plunge three red candles two green to get everyone excited followed by the plunge this also this Plunge here occurred in May okay Bitcoin rallied until you know the end of March early April so you had one month where the ethereum Bitcoin valuation held on You could argue that back over here that month was April now that month is potentially March right and and then you kick the can down the road one more month and and the same the same thing could easily play out okay that's something to keep in mind the other thing that we've talked about before that has kept me on the bearish side especially for the altcoin market is the relatively low Bitcoin dominance uh probably one of my most um polarizing opinions but it is what it is I'm not going to shy away from it I do think there's a lot of garbage in the space that needs to get cleaned up if you take a look at the dominance including stable coins yes it has had a pretty significant pullback recently I also see higher lows this also includes stable coins if you go and exclude stable coins from the equation you'll notice that it's it's actually been slowly trending higher for for quite a long period of time right like just putting in higher low after higher low after higher low and and I I think that is an important consideration to make you know if you include Stables yeah like it deviates if you go look at the comparison between Bitcoin dominance with and without Stables this is what it looks like so yes the stablecoin market has grown significantly you know since May of 2021 but excluding Stables Bitcoin has been outperforming the vast majority of the altcoin market even though there are a few altcoins that have outperformed but there always are and I I don't I don't mean to hide from that like there always are some altcoins that outperform one other thing to consider with regards to could Bitcoin uh go lower is take a look at Bitcoin and I want I want us to Overlay interest rates so we're going to Overlay U.S interest rates take a look at this when did Bitcoin bottom last cycle when we hit the terminal rate Bitcoin bottomed in 2018 when we hit the terminal rate after we hit the terminal rate Bitcoin went sideways until the FED started to cut now Bitcoin didn't go down because the FED started to cut Bitcoin went down because there was a problem with the economy and because of that the FED started to cut the FED recently has been continuing to raise interest rates right they've been continuing to raise interest rates um and and we know that the expectations have have been constantly shifting right I mean sort of the expectation on on where is It ultimately going to go has been shifting fairly consistently and if I pull it up here um one of the things that's interesting is you can see there's actually about a subtle shift here uh from from 25 basis points being the most likely outcome the Now 50 basis points being the most likely outcome not with the most recent drop in asset prices uh this has actually come back down a little bit you can see that yesterday it was actually closer to 80 percent likelihood of a 50 Business Point rate hike now let's come back down to about 60 percent the market is really unsure one of the reasons is because inflation um the the the Fairly optimistic readings on inflation that we got uh back in November and December a lot of those were revised back up to the upside uh like pal like Powell mentioned and then additionally we've just had a lot of hot inflation readings since then and so the market has has been potentially underpricing the the terminal rate but if you go look at probabilities going pretty far out you can see that the terminal rate is now being priced to be about five and three quarters and for the FED to start cutting in November okay so what happens if the FED reaches the terminal rate in June maybe Bitcoin rallies right a Bitcoin rallies after they reach the terminal rate just like Bitcoin rallied after their terminal rate in 2018. but then at some point the FED had to start cutting because they did so much damage to the economy that's what sends us into a recession normally right is they do too much damage to the economy and the FED started to cut so you could argue that whenever we reach the terminal rate Bitcoin could Rally from that point until the economy falls apart and the FED has to cut right if the terminal rate is reached by June and the FED starts If the Fed has to start cutting late this year that could also correspond to that September October November time frame where you see a potential lower low on the price but maybe a higher low on the weekly RSI and then perhaps that would would Mark you know be the end of it you know again you know I I say this we look at this and and you get scared some people get scared you can also look at this and say wow you know think about the opportunity these guys had to see that 83 percent move to the downside followed by a a um a 2 000 percent move to the upside in the next cycle sounds pretty nice to me you know I don't know I mean it's just something to consider right furthermore maybe I'll throw in a little bit of a just one bullish thing just uh just to um get you thinking you guys remember the um the comparison we made with the prices what if I can just pull it back up if I uh undo this enough um there it is this is the this was uh the NASDAQ where did this rally start all the way back here at around a hundred dollars right I don't know 108 something like that I I don't I mean I'm not gonna go find it exactly it was around 108. and then where did ethereum start it's rally that took us to 4 800. hey where did it start you if you say it started here in March it's about 90. okay so it it was even from the lows it was basically the same move 90 so 100 to 4 800. 100 to 4 800. for the NASDAQ it took place over 15 years for ethereum it took place over one year for the NASDAQ we then had this this peak here was at 2 000 but this peak was at sixteen thousand this is ultimately the vision I would actually have for ethereum I mean I'm not saying that it has to go that high next cycle but I do think it will eventually come out of this mess and and and and Trend back much higher so I just want you to be aware that you know while we do talk about these potential negative outcomes and these bearish outcomes we don't do so from a perspective of of saying like oh well crypto just has to go down forever it's just trying to have realistic expectations as to what the market might actually bring us okay now a couple of indicators I want to take a look at if you go take a look at some of the bottoming indicators there's plenty of them that you know you could make the case for that the bottom is already in right plenty of them you know you can look at the one-year Roi and say Hey you know like it looks pretty cyclical uh pretty cyclical to me um the counterpoints is that Bitcoin did capitulate here in the next few weeks you could see it go back down to those same levels so that's something to consider but one thing that I I remind myself of is that normally the mar the market bottoms on apathy take a look at the social risk they bottomed on apathy last cycle this time when the market bottoms everyone starts to tune back in because they just can't get enough of watching the train wreck that's why I think we have to consider like what if the market needs to still get more apathetic like it did back over here so you can imagine you take a moving average of this 30-day moving average right it's it's still trending down just like it was trending down over here overlay this with a price of eth and color code it and what do you get you get something looks like this what happened when it went dark blue when the social risk went to the lowest wristband what happened that's when ethereum capitulated it's heading that way now it looks like to me um so that's why I think something we have to be aware of as well furthermore you could look at the total indicator risk that includes the social on chain and price risk and see kind of where we are within the context of History right a low a high a lower low a lower high kind of very similar to what we saw here on the NASDAQ um or on the um on the textbook bubble thing that we were looking at so the other indicators that I want to draw your attention to one of them is the 30-day estimated Supply and profit and loss normally the market cycle bottom comes after they cross right so cross bottom cross in the bottom or sorry the crop fake cross real cross right is it something cross for like a day or two the real cross bottom across here and then bottom this time I think this is sort of the fake cross like we had back in 2015. why because after this very brief cross the market had did not go lower but now you can see there's starting to curl back up so it's almost like you know the market couldn't help themselves right like investors couldn't help themselves they had to front run it but what if we eventually have to go there anyways and the people that front run it front ran it just got a bit ahead of themselves and and perhaps we still have to go to that level maybe we could also take a look at at the balance price which is something that I think is is worthwhile to um take a look at if you look at the balance price one of the things you'll note is that normally we get the market cycle bottom on a daily close below the balance price you can see this is what happened in um 2011. you can see that in 2015 that the market cycle bottom occurred on daily closes below the balance price you're like in 2018 the bar the market cycle bottom occurred on daily closes below the balance price and then if you look in 2023 2022 the we didn't go below it not on not on a daily close we did Wick below it because you can see it was at 15 7 and we know we went to 15 4 or 15 5 and 15 4. but on a daily close we were not below it and now the balance price is sitting at 14.4 k so you know this could be just to say hey well you know maybe we just actually have to come back and complete it you know like instead of leaving these things just like slightly out of you know slightly higher than where they should have been uh perhaps we eventually come back down and and do ultimately put those um sort of those major lows in um and it it's just a possibility again there's no guarantees here the other thing that I I think we we talked about a little bit uh going back to sort of Bitcoin and some of these indicators one of them is is the um the weekly death cross so if you look at at the death cross I mean you can see a lot of people discount it right because you always get a rally right we've said this every single time every time you have a golden cross or not every time but most time you get a golden cross what happens on the daily time frame you get a dump followed by a continuation of the trend that's what happened right you had a golden cross here you had a dump followed by a continuation of the trend to the upside but the same thing you could say on the on the weekly everyone always always um a lot of people give these things these indicators sort of bad uh bad reps but a lot of times they actually are kind of informative I mean you have a weekly death cross and you pump that's why everyone makes fun of it right because you hear death cross and then it pumps so you make fun of it you hear Golden Cross on a dumps so you make fun of it but normally it in the short term it does the opposite of what the cross would indicate followed by a continuation of the trend that caused the cross in the first place okay so you saw that on the daily time frame on the weekly time frame you had a cross a death cross followed by a pump just to get everyone to sort of point and laugh at the death cross and anyone who talked about it followed by a continuation of the trend that caused the death cross in the first place look at the S P 500 and look at the context of History whenever we had a death cross on the S P while you're forward 12 month return was was fairly okay it didn't mean that you couldn't go down another 30 percent from that from that level right go down another 20 30 percent from the level and you go back and look at the 70s when we had a period of high inflation right death cross went down another 20 percent death cross we went down another 34 percent right so just because you get the opposite of what the death cross would suggest or the Golden Cross would suggest doesn't mean that it it can ultimately play out in the same you know eventually play out even if you get a short-term move just to sort of uh get people um sort of offsides on what their expectations of it would ultimately bring you know this is something we haven't really seen before and furthermore You could argue you You could argue that um sorry let me get the uh write in thing on here sorry I want the uh 400 week sorry that is the four I want the 300 week here so let me find the um let me switch this one to 300. so one thing that we've talked about before as well is that you know the first cycle sort of held support on the 100 week the second cycle held on the 200 the third held on the 300 maybe we have to go to the 400 okay possibility right and the 400 is is below the prior low okay that's I mean it's it's below 15K so that's something I think you have to consider as well now at some point soon I wanna I'm gonna put out a video and and we're gonna go through the the the the bull case and the bear case Okay because obviously this was the bear case but we we have a video series called the Bulls versus the Bears we did one a few months ago in fact um and in that video series we said hey look guys I know a lot of people think June's the bottom but there's a good chance we're going to be putting in new lows based on what we're seeing with the um with these indicators and in fact we did and so I think it's worthwhile to to sort of systematically go through those indicators again to sort of get a gauge as to as to where we potentially are now one thing to consider here in the short term is that Bitcoin is at the bull market support band so um you know this is sort of the first line of the fence for the Bulls right to try to hold here the Counterpoint for the Bears is that normally after you know after a year where it just goes down and we get a pump above the bull market sport band we fail to hold it on the first attempt we failed to hold it in 2019 on the first attempt and we failed to hold it in 2015 on the first attempt so the argument is that while we could fail to hold it here that doesn't mean you won't see it bounce a little bit I mean it bounced a little bit in 2019 before going below it but that is something to consider is that normally you don't hold it on the first attempt the market is just still too weak now you might say well what's going to cause what would cause us you know what would cause this worst case scenario because cyclically seems like Bitcoins run its course has it not I mean go look at some of the other indicators right go look at the um go look at the mbrvz score it looks pretty low right compared to Prior Cycles you might say well it's slightly higher yeah but so was the prior cycle was slightly higher than the one before that and that was higher than one for that so mbrp z-score seems somewhat in check the pure multiple seems somewhat in check though the Counterpoint is normally goes down to 0.3 and we didn't quite make it there it's like we got so close right we got so close if Bitcoin had gone down just like a couple thousand more dollars the indicator would have already flashed uh at the same level it had before the hash ribbon sort of gave a false signal back in the summer um and we we talked about I you know I said I did not believe it I thought we would go put a new low at the end of the year and you can see that it gave a new signal in January but it could again be just a false signal normally you'll get several of them before you get a real sustainable Market uh so that is something to consider as well one thing that I was looking at recently  um I'm getting a little ahead of myself I mean I don't want to talk about too much in this video we'll leave some stuff for for future videos but the I think the other you know there's other there's some other things we could talk about I'm just trying to figure out if it's worthwhile to to really go how far if you look at this chart the total market cap the lower regression trend line down here you can see it's below 600 billion we mentioned that it you know the worst case is probably somewhere four to five hundred billion if you take the percent difference between the market cap and the fair value log in the concussion trend line you get something looks like this draw a line at the bottom you can see we normally go about 65 undervalued right now we are only about 52 undervalued so that's where we currently set um with respect to that perhaps you know perhaps we should go ahead and wrap it up here um we've covered quite a bit and um and I think it's worthwhile to just sort of think about everything in this video not to take it to the bank or anything like that but just to consider it in your list of potential outcomes especially given the fact that we are continuing to follow um the analog from the.com crash with respect to with respect to crypto and then maybe maybe one last thing is when comparing all this everything's somewhat related right if you look at if you look at the S P 500 bear markets and look at the context of History and we look at this bear Market compared to sort of the extremes of Prior bear markets you can see we're right at that level where we would have gotten rejected in Prior bear markets that could lead us to new lows the average bear market for the s p is about nine months we already had that but the one that includes recessions is closer to a year and a half and there's still plenty of evidence to to to think that we are in fact heading for a recession even though it hasn't occurred yet I'm not of the I haven't been in the opinion uh for you know I know a lot of people said recession in 2022 and they just keep calling recession but again the indicators suggest one is coming not necessarily that we're in one or that we've been in one okay just because the stock market goes down does not mean we're in a recession okay we we go down I mean 2018 the stock market went down crypto went down a lot crypto went down more back then than it has so far this cycle it still wasn't a recession you look at the yield curve right treasury yield spreads historically when you get these spreads uh the only way out is is via a recession right that's the way out when you look at the treasury yield curve you can see the inversion of the yield curve and when did it look similar to this normally it looks like this go back to the recession back in the financial crisis right you saw the inversion go back to the.com crash you saw the inversion you see the inversion now so again the the way the reason why the worst case scenario might play out is nothing necessarily related to crypto but it could just be because of a recession it could also be due to regulations there's a lot of reasons I think that it could play out because of that we need to consider it I think we'll go ahead and wrap it up make sure you subscribe if you're not subscribed give the video a thumbs up again we do have into the cryptiverse premium at into the cryptoverse.com we actually do three premium videos per week on one on the weekend one on Tuesdays and then an A A on Thursdays so just give you an idea of some of the stuff you get and uh and so on and so forth so and that's for the um the highest here but I think we'll wrap it up there and I will see you guys next time bye",Youtube video,2023-03-10 00:00:00,"The video presents a detailed analysis comparing the current cryptocurrency market to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s, suggesting that the crypto bear market could follow a similar trajectory to the NASDAQ's recovery after the dot-com bubble burst. The presenter believes the total cryptocurrency market capitalization could potentially drop to around $400-500 billion, representing a 40-50% correction from current levels, based on the NASDAQ's 83% decline during the dot-com crash.The presenter analyzes the weekly RSI (Relative Strength Index) of Bitcoin and Ethereum, drawing parallels to the NASDAQ's RSI behavior during the dot-com crash, and suggests that a higher low on the RSI could signal a potential market bottom. The presenter also compares the length of the current crypto bear market to the 133-week bear market experienced by the NASDAQ, noting that if the crypto bear market follows a similar timeline, it could potentially bottom out in October 2023.Additionally, the presenter discusses the potential impact of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, suggesting that Bitcoin could rally after the terminal rate is reached, similar to its behavior in 2018, but may then face further downside if the Fed is forced to start cutting rates due to economic damage. The presenter also highlights various on-chain and technical indicators, such as the 30-day estimated Supply and Profit/Loss, the Balance Price, and the weekly death cross in Bitcoin, as potential signals for a market bottom.While acknowledging the possibility of deviations from the NASDAQ's historical pattern, the overall sentiment expressed in the video is bearish in the short-term, with the presenter suggesting that the current crypto bear market could present a generational opportunity for long-term investors if it follows a similar trajectory to the dot-com crash.",368,"[0.021453857,
